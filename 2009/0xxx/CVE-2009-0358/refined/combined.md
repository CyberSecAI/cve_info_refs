# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-06

## Directives to not cache pages ignored

Announced
February 3, 2009
Reporter
Paul Nel
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.6

### Description

**Paul Nel** reported that certain HTTP directives to
not cache web pages, Cache-Control: no-store and Cache-Control:
no-cache for HTTPS pages, were being ignored by Firefox 3. On a
shared system, applications relying upon these HTTP directives could
potentially expose private data. Another user on the system could use
this vulnerability to view improperly cached pages containing private
data by navigating the browser back.

Firefox 2 releases are not affected.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

firefox security update (RHSA-2009-0256)

Original Release Date: February 4, 2009

Last Revised: February 4, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-040

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content.
A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names
[CVE-2009-0352](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0352), [CVE-2009-0353](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0353) and [CVE-2009-0356](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0356) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the way malformed content was processed.
A
website containing specially-crafted content could, potentially, trick a
Firefox user into surrendering sensitive information.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the names
[CVE-2009-0354](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0354) and
[CVE-2009-0355](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0355) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox treated HTTPOnly cookies. An
attacker
able to execute arbitrary JavaScript on a target site using HTTPOnly
cookies may be able to use this flaw to steal the cookie.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2009-0357](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0357) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox treated certain HTTP page caching
directives. A local attacker could steal the contents of sensitive pages
which the page author did not intend to be cached.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2009-0358](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0358) to this issue.

For technical details regarding these flaws, please see the Mozilla
security advisories for Firefox 3.0.6.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0256.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all vulnerable system products,
Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| AES 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0256)

## Topic

An updated firefox package that fixes various security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2009-0352, CVE-2009-0353, CVE-2009-0356)

Several flaws were found in the way malformed content was processed. A
website containing specially-crafted content could, potentially, trick a
Firefox user into surrendering sensitive information. (CVE-2009-0354,
CVE-2009-0355)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox treated HTTPOnly cookies. An attacker
able to execute arbitrary JavaScript on a target site using HTTPOnly
cookies may be able to use this flaw to steal the cookie. (CVE-2009-0357)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox treated certain HTTP page caching
directives. A local attacker could steal the contents of sensitive pages
which the page author did not intend to be cached. (CVE-2009-0358)

For technical details regarding these flaws, please see the Mozilla
security advisories for Firefox 3.0.6. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 3.0.6, which corrects these issues. After installing the
update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Mozilla Firefox browser is updated to version 3.0.6 fixing various
security and stability issues.
MFSA 2009-01 / CVE-2009-0352 / CVE-2009-0353: Mozilla developers
identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used
in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes
showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and
we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be
exploited to run arbitrary code.
MFSA 2009-02 / CVE-2009-0354: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that a chrome XBL method can be used in conjunction with
window.eval to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of
another website, violating the same origin policy. Firefox 2 releases
are not affected.
MFSA 2009-03 / CVE-2009-0355: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that a form input controls type could be changed during the
restoration of a closed tab. An attacker could set an input controls
text value to the path of a local file whose location was known to
the attacker. If the tab was then closed and the victim persuaded
to re-open it, upon restoring the tab the attacker could use this
vulnerability to change the input type to file. Scripts in the page
could then automatically submit the form and steal the contents of
the user's local file.
MFSA 2009-04 / CVE-2009-0356: Mozilla security researcher Georgi
Guninski reported that the fix for an earlier vulnerability reported
by Liu Die Yu using local internet shortcut files to access other
sites (MFSA 2008-47) could be bypassed by redirecting to a privileged
about: URI such as about:plugins. If an attacker could get a victim
to download two files, a malicious HTML file and a .desktop shortcut
file, they could have the HTML document load a privileged chrome
document via the shortcut and both documents would be treated as same
origin. This vulnerability could potentially be used by an attacker
to inject arbitrary code into the chrome document and execute with
chrome privileges. Because this attack has relatively high complexity,
the severity of this issue was determined to be moderate.
MFSA 2009-05 / CVE-2009-0357: Developer and Mozilla community
member Wladimir Palant reported that cookies marked HTTPOnly were
readable by JavaScript via the XMLHttpRequest.getResponseHeader and
XMLHttpRequest.getAllResponseHeaders APIs. This vulnerability bypasses
the security mechanism provided by the HTTPOnly flag which intends to
restrict JavaScript access to document.cookie.
The fix prevents the XMLHttpRequest feature from accessing the
Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers of any response whether or not
the HTTPOnly flag was set for those cookies.
MFSA 2009-06 / CVE-2009-0358: Paul Nel reported that certain HTTP
directives to not cache web pages, Cache-Control: no-store and
Cache-Control: no-cache for HTTPS pages, were being ignored by
Firefox 3. On a shared system, applications relying upon these HTTP
directives could potentially expose private data. Another user on the
system could use this vulnerability to view improperly cached pages
containing private data by navigating the browser back.
Fixes for older Firefox and other Mozilla versions are being worked on.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Mozilla Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-717-1: Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

10 February 2009

Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [firefox-3.0](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.0) -
* [xulrunner-1.9](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. These problems could allow

an attacker to crash the browser and possibly execute arbitrary code with user

privileges. ([CVE-2009-0352](/security/CVE-2009-0352), [CVE-2009-0353](/security/CVE-2009-0353))

A flaw was discovered in the JavaScript engine. An attacker could bypass the

same-origin policy in Firefox by utilizing a chrome XBL method and execute

arbitrary JavaScript within the context of another website. ([CVE-2009-0354](/security/CVE-2009-0354))

A flaw was discovered in the browser engine when restoring closed tabs. If a

user were tricked into restoring a tab to a malicious website with form input

controls, an attacker could steal local files on the user's system.

([CVE-2009-0355](/security/CVE-2009-0355))

Wladimir Palant discovered that Firefox did not restrict access to cookies in

HTTP response headers. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web

page, a remote attacker could view sensitive information. ([CVE-2009-0357](/security/CVE-2009-0357))

Paul Nel discovered that Firefox did not honor certain Cache-Control HTTP

directives. A local attacker could exploit this to view private data in

improperly cached pages of another user. ([CVE-2009-0358](/security/CVE-2009-0358))

User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
From your description, you're encountering some problem with disable
client-side browser cache in firefox browser.
Regarding on this, I've also performed some test on my side. Generally, the
following code should be necessary to disable client-side cache:
=======================
Protected Sub Page\_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As
System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load
Response.Cache.SetAllowResponseInBrowserHistory(False)
Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache)
Response.Cache.SetNoStore()
Response.Expires = 0
Response.Write("<br/>" & DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString())
End Sub
==============================
And my local tests showed that it works corretly for IE7 and firefox 2.0.
However, for firefox 3.0, it does not work. I think it is due to the
implemenation of the firefox 3. BTW, the cache control http header is a
advisory info and the actual implemation is not mandatory and depend on the
browser, so I suggest you also try submit this issue to firefox community
to see whether this is an by design behavior.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load page with "no-cache" or "no-store" directive
2. Go forward to next page
3.Go back button on browser, page loads from cache.
Actual Results:
Page loads from cache, but should re-load from server or show message that page has expired.

Why did you mark this bug security sensitive? Doesn't look to me like a security issue that needs to be kept confidential.
Do you have a live site that can be used to test this?Keywords: [regression](/buglist.cgi?keywords=regression&resolution=---)Product: Firefox → CoreQA Contact: general → general

Hi,
I marked it as sensitive because when a page is marked as no-cache, quite often it is to ensure that sensitive info is not cached and can't be displayed again after clicking the browser's back button.
Unfortunately I do not currently have a live site where this can be demonstrated.
Further, I should perhaps refine my original description. The cache directives are ignored when you page through different wizard steps of the Microsoft .Net framwework wizard control.
To reproduce, add the following code in an aspx page, add a wizardcontrol (call it wizard1) to the page, compile and run. If using the browswer's back button after advancing a step, you will see that the time printed in the wizard is the cached time. In IE the step shows as expired. Although these are wizardsteps, they are in fact emitted as a new html page for each step (each step has the same page name though).
Partial Class \_Default
Inherits System.Web.UI.Page
Protected Sub Page\_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load
Response.Cache.SetAllowResponseInBrowserHistory(False)
Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache)
Response.Cache.SetNoStore()
Response.Expires = 0
Response.Write("<br/>" & DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString())
End Sub
Protected Sub Wizard1\_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Wizard1.Load
Wizard1.ActiveStep.Title = (DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString())
End Sub
End Class

Ah, OK. Keeping this bug report hidden doesn't really protect anyone, though - in fact opening it increases the number of people who can investigate further, and means that people who are affected (assuming it is valid) can know about it and take steps to address the problem (by purging caches manually, etc.).Group: security

Hi,
I guess you are right. It should not be marked as confidential.

Hello everyone.
We have detected this same issue affecting one of our applications. Firefox3 users (firefox 2, safari, IE6/7 users aren't affected) can use the back button to view a page which contains sensitive data without firefox trying to retrieve it again from the server even if cache-control directives are sent both in the http response and the html code.
Currently this is the response we send:
<http://pastebin.com/m261596f6> HTTP
<http://pastebin.com/m7d550841> HTML
we've tried also many other combinations of cache-control directives without success.

I don't know if it's only my case but its related to forms using POST method, I've yet to implement session data but you can test in <http://www.pikanya.net/testcache/> it sends cache-control directives but you can use the back button without reloading the page from the server. Firefox 2 will show a dialog warning you that going back will redo any action to prevent accidental double posting or affecting data. Firefox 3 just silently uses the cached page ignoring any cache control directive used.

The problem is also with Ajax requests. FireBug shows that ajax request is sent, but the data for sure comes from previous request. If you add at the end of the link/request path e.g. timestamp - it works because FF3 thinks that this is new link.

This bug could be very bad for us. I have these settings in httpd.conf in Apache:
<Files ~ "\.(xml|swf)$">
Header set Cache-Control "no-cache, must-revalidate"
</files>
Since I Firefox 3 (now on 3.0.1), they are ignored, and each time I publish a new swf file the browser still gives me the old one.
For me it's just a small inconvenience, but if thousands of our users start calling our support team it will not be fun here. We need our client's browsers to check if XML and SWF files have been modified. We encouraged them all to use Firefox. Disabling the cache would cause too much traffic on our servers.
Is there any workaround?

Setting 'Cache-Control: no-store' seems to prevent FF3 from caching things. This is still a rather horrible bug though -- trying to actually do validated caching as HTTP intended (sending a Last-Modified, checking If-Last-Modified, and sending a 304 when the page is still valid) is completely broken by this. Duplicating it is simple as could be -- set up your webserver to send a 'Cache-Control: max-age=0, must-revalidate', and use Tamper Data or Firebug to watch the browser happily re-use its cache without validating. The HTTP spec is extremely clear on this, it is not allowed.

I've been able to reproduce this issue in many sites with sensitive data, just log in, fill any form inside the session, log out and you'll be able to use the back button if the last page was requested with POST thus letting you see the last page. You are still unable to interact with it if the server has properly destroyed the session, but things like taxing information from your government or your last broking/banking operation could be visible by unintended people with access to the computer or even malicious software which can read the cache.

To Paul Nel(bug opener):
Do you use Fx with bfcache=On?
(Fast Back&Forward. Non-ZERO browser.sessionhistory.max\_total\_viewers )
(Fx's default : browser.sessionhistory.max\_total\_viewers=-1 )
( -1 : (a) Unlimited, when initial bfcache implemetation)
( (b) Till internal max with trunk )
( I don't know which with Fx 3 )
What will happen when browser.sessionhistory.max\_total\_viewers=0 is set?
AFAIK, bfcache is never "cache" defined by HTTP even though string of "cache" is used in his name, and "Open new page then Back with bfcache=on" is similar to "Open new tab and switch to the new tab, then back to original tab by tab click".
i.e. bfcache changed meaning/action of Back button from traditional one (Back==Reload) to one similar to "Tab hiding + Tab switching", without sufficient documentation, without sufficient explanation to users.
Then, it produced/is producing many confusions, and produced claims like yours and claims like bugs listed in meta [Bug 415889](/show_bug.cgi?id=415889 "NEW - [Meta] Submit-button of form won't work, when the form is re-displayed by Back button, if site disables the button after submit (bfcache=on, browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers!=0)"). Good grief...

Abe san, do you mean "no problem with Fx 2, but problem started to occur with Fx 3.0.0 and continues with Fx 3.0.1"?
For SWF, Ajax etc. page which is held in bfcache :
As I wrote, data held in bfcache is similar to a tab(but hidden). I saw bug report(s) for phenomenon due to continuing execution at the "hidden tab".
- High CPU usage because of heavy workload by script in the "hidden tab"
- Continuous request to server by Ajax from the "hidden tab"
Sorry but I can't recall bug number.

Firefox won't read your program source held at server. Fx reads really sent HTTP headers only.
To Paul Nel(bug opener):
What are really sent HTTP headers?
Is there any conflicting or ambiguous specification in really sent headers?
(e.g. Cache-Control: no-cache, private, max-age=100, max-age=50, ...)
(HTTP 1.1 spec for conflicted/ambiguous specification is not so clear)

I'm not sure this is the same thing that [comment #10](/show_bug.cgi?id=441751#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Directives not to cache pages ignored.") is talking about, but if you go to <http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/ffcache/> , and press the button a bunch of times, you can use your favourite http-debugger to verify that FF3 does not make a new request for every XHR call, while a "Cache-Control: max-age=0, must-revalidate" header \*is\* being sent. At least, that's what happens on my setup.

Test result with Fx 3.0.1, with extension of LiveHTTPHeaders only, on MS Win-XP SP3.
1. Load test page => /testcache/ (say P-1, nothing in about:cache)
2. Submit(POST) => same /testcache/ (say P-2, nothing in about:cache)
3. Submit(POST) => same /testcache/ (say P-3, nothing in about:cache)
4. Submit(POST) => same /testcache/ (say P-4, nothing in about:cache)
5. Load new URI in the Tab (say Q-1)
6. Back => Nothing happens
7. Expand Back/Forward button => P-1 to P-4, and Q-1 are listed
8. Click P-4/P-3/P-2 => Nothing happens
9. Click P-1 => HTTP GET was issued (Reload was executed)
Above was observed with both browser.sessionhistory.max\_total\_viewers = -1 & 0.
It looks to be history.forward/back/go problem when POST & no-cache(and/or no-store).
Firebug doesn't have relation to problem(s) when your test case.
Phenomenon with Firebug should be analyzed independently, if different phenomenon when Firebug is used.
[Comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=441751#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Directives not to cache pages ignored.") sounds for me to be phenomenon at above step 6, with GET/Fx 3.0.0/(bfcache=On/Off is still unclear. I guess bfcache=On), without Firebug,
although [Comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=441751#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Directives not to cache pages ignored.") is possibly Firebug's issue like SWF/Ajax+Firebug cases reported by other comment posters.
To ps@gft.com:
I recommend you to open separate bug for ease off analysis, because minimum/reliable test case is already available by you, and because POST involves different issues from GET in many cases.
By the way, your case returns following header.
> Cache-Control: private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=0
"private" means "enable caching", and conflicts with "no-cache" which disables caching. Although HTTP 1.1 says "restrictive one is to be used" and Fx treats it as "no-cache" request instead of "private" request, inconsistent/ambiguous/duplicated header/parameter should be carefully excluded from test case. If such headers/parameters are used in bug report, we have to start from needless analysis of HTTP 1.1's unclear spec(sometimes, nothing is described) for inconsistent/ambiguous/duplicated header/parameter, and we have to do needless analysis of Fx's design/spec/code for inconsistent/ambiguous/duplicated header/parameter.

I've spent an hour or two working through the various Minefield nightly builds for Firefox 3. According to my tests this behaviour is first observable in the build 2007-07-09-04-trunk (<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2007/07/2007-07-09-04-trunk/>) it is not observable in the build 2007-07-08-04-trunk.
The contents of 'Help -> About' is: "version 3.0a7pre (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9a7pre) Gecko/2007070904 Minefield/3.0a7pre)"
In order to identify this I used a fresh Vista virtual machine with no other software installed. I then installed a Minefield build, tested and uninstalled Minefield. I did this many times. Installation was done from the Windows executable for the build.
In the build dated 8th July 2007 clicking the back button results in a Resend/Cancel dialogue which will resubmit the request as expected. In the build dated 9th July 2007 clicking the back button results in a cached page being displayed with no request being sent to the server. This is despite "cache-control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=0" being set.
The Minefield install had no addons. No Firebug, no DOM Inspector, no Feedback Agent.
Hope this helps! :-)

Tested with your case(without Firebug, on MS Win-XP SP3).
I could reproduce POST problem.
With Fx 3.0.1 : No warning of POST data upon Back. No HTTP GET upon Back.
With Fx 2.0.0.14 : Warning of POST data, then Cancel
But I couldn't reproduce problem with GET case(no-cache,no-store,...) with both Fx 2.0.0.14 and Fx 3.0.1. HTTP GET was issued upon Back any time.
(This result perhaps indicates [Comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=441751#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Directives not to cache pages ignored.") is problem with Firebug...)

Oh, sorry for may confusing comment. I'd like to say;
If [Comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=441751#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Directives not to cache pages ignored.") was for POST case, since [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=441751#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Directives not to cache pages ignored.") says that it was fx 3
only problem(no problem with Fx 2), I can't imagine situation that bug opener
opened this bug without referring to "No warning about POST data exists".
So I guessed and said that [Comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=441751#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Directives not to cache pages ignored.") was for GET case.
I believe following is appropriate, since [Comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=441751#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Directives not to cache pages ignored."), original problem of this bug, is still not unclear.
Open separate bugs for (A) GET related problem with Firebug and (B) POST
related problem without Firebug. And, close this bug as DUP of (A) or (B),
or continue analysis of [Comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=441751#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Directives not to cache pages ignored.") case.

This problem seems to be somehow related to the browser configuration. I just tested, using Firefox 3.0.1 (as present in Ubuntu):
- my \*usual\* browser, with horde of extensions installed, does not allow to back to the pages protected with cache control (= behaves properly)
- separate empty profile (just MOZ\_NO\_REMOTE=1 firefox -P and new Profile created) allows to Back to such page.
The same confirmed on some Windows computer

"GET case or POST case or Both" is still unclear (I guess 'GET' case).
"With Firebug or without Firebug" is still unclear.
Really sent HTTP headers are still unclear.
(bug opener provided his server side application logic only.)
(bug opener doesn't provide really HTTP header sent by his server yet.)
With bfcache=On only, or bfcache=Off only, or both bfcache=On&bfcache=Off,
is still unclear.
(bug opener still doesn't provide his set up which relates to bfcache.)
(2) With Firebug only problem.
(2-A) With Ajax
(2-B) With Flash(SWF)
(Looks to be "GET" case. I don't know bfcache related issue or not.)
(3) POST case
Warning of "POST data exists" is issued by Fx 2, but no warnig with Fx 3.
Problem occurs with bfcahe=On & bfcache=Off.
Firebug has no relation to the issue.
Real HTTP header sent by server is clear(test page is already provided.)
> Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age = 0
Note: If HTTP GET, apparently "no problem", accordigng to test results.

(3)
I have POST-based application (initial GET, then POST, POST, POST, POST, ...). All responses are flagged by Cache-Control: no-cache (switching to Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age = 0 does not change anything in the behaviour described). In Firefox 3 I can freely Back to previous page without being prompted for re-POST. It is configuration-dependant (as I said, the same Firefox, the same application, old profile warns, fresh profile makes Back). It is also 'mysterious-factor' dependant (two applications, using the same technology, returning the same headers, one allows for Backs, another one does not)
Only Fx 3.

Are you able to attach the prefs.js file from each of your profiles to this issue? That may help move us forward.

Booom... Checked - just to make sure - and today both my profiles allow for Back. I don't remember changing anything myself (except restarting Firefox a moment before...) Now I am curious whether the session history can matter.
Of course I can send my prefs.js from the - say - simpler profile, but I doubt it will be of help in this case :-(

... found something.
\*The same\* Firefox profile.
a) I open Firefox, open only the service I test. Firefox allow for backs.
b) I open 5 new tabs, loading some webpage in every of them (in my case it were chessbase.com, pilka.interia.pl, sport.pl, info.onet.pl and gazeta.pl). Whoa whoa, since then Firefox behaves properly and asks to rePOST the data !!!

(and it keeps behaving properly even after I close those extra tabs)
If I remember correctly, also other tests where Firefox allowed for backs were made on newly started browser instance.
Some specific behaviour when memory cache is not yet filled?

The same behaviour confirmed on some windows machine (my tests were on Linux) - Firefox allows (improperly) to make Backs, I open 5 new tabs with reasonably heavy pages, Firefox starts asking whether to rePOST.

To Jason Deabill:
At least 4 persons, you, ps@gft.com, Marcin Kasperski, and me, could re-produce problem in POST case.
In order to "move us forward", please open separate bug for POST case only, with your minimum & simple & very good test case, for ease of problem analysis, to make problem analysis efficient, and to avoid confusion.
(Please note that original problem of this bug, [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=441751#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Directives not to cache pages ignored."), is still unclear.)

Attached file
[prefs.js](attachment.cgi?id=332956)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=332956&action=edit)

This is prefs.js from my smaller Profile. Mostly new, post-install Ubuntu Firefox
I verified that this Profile proves the same behaviour: newly started Firefox 3.0.1 allows to make Back in spite of (no) cache controls, when I open some tabs and visit a couple of resource-heavy pages, Firefox starts to ask whether to rePOST.
(I won't attach prefs.js from the other Profile as it is 200kB, contains some private data - and both profiles behave exactly the same).

I can confirm on FF 3.0.1 that Firebug 1.2.0b13 is the direct cause. Caching works fine without Firebug enabled.

The Firebug cache bug, I believe, is a separate bug. The Firebug cache bug seems to require Javascript to alter the browser history for the bug to appear, and the page to be forcibly cached. Not that there couldn't be an interaction with the issue on this page and Firebug's issue, but this one is experienced without Firebug.

I also have what seems to be the same problem which only happens when Firebug is running. It seems to happen only on one particular case for me which is when I set the src attribute of an image to an empty string and set it to any other non empty string after. Here's an example (in PHP):
<?php
header('Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8');
header('Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate, max-age=0');
?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "<http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd>">
<html xmlns="<http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
<head>
<title>Test cache</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><?php print rand(); ?></p>
<script type="text/javascript">
var testImage = new Image()
testImage.src = "smdflkmdfs"
testImage.src = ""
testImage.src = "werwer"
</script>
</body>
</html>
The page will not refresh until I clear the cache. The page should show a different number everytime I navigate to it. If you comment out the testImage.src = "" line, it works normally.

It also works normally if you comment out the testImage.src = "werwer" line but leave the testImage.src = "" line. The testImage.src = "smdflkmdfs" line could be removed as it makes no difference.

I have been trying to find out why enabled Firebug (specifically console and net panel) is the reason that pages with \*not to cache\* directive are stored.
I have narrowed the problem to the point when I have a separate/simple FF extension, which can be used to reproduce the problem.
Please see my comment (with the test extension attached) here:
<http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/detail?id=1029#c46>
I have been testing it with:
<http://www.janodvarko.cz/firebug/tests/1029/Issue1029.php>
The core problem, briefly (see my comment for more details) seems to be the openCacheEntry method from nsICacheSession interface). If I am using the method the problem is there (e.g. the URL is stored in the cache even if it should not) if not the problem is gone.
Could anybody please verify the theory? Perhaps the interface is just used in a wrong way?

This is definately an issue. What can we do to move this to confirmed status?
I have tested this with several combinations of http headers and head meta tags using HTTPS. All with the same results: All POST requests are stored in the memory cache.

I found that the following site recaps this caching issue very well:
<http://blogs.imeta.co.uk/JDeabill/archive/2008/07/14/303.aspx>
The caching issue is as follows:
1) A POST request returns a response with cache-control: no-cache, or using any other cache control headers including Pragma and Expires.
2) Move away from the POST response page via any method, e.g. go to www.google.com, etc.
3) Use the browser back button to go back to the POST response page, which previously had no-cache specified.
4) With Firefox 3.0.x (including 3.0.3 as of 9/29/08). The POST response page is displayed via the cache, which is a security risk if the POST response page contains credit card numbers or personal information. In other browsers, some kind of a "Warning: Page has Expired" (IE6 as an example), would be displayed.
5) This erroneous POST response caching behavior is regardless of the form submission via HTTP or HTTPS.
6) There is a trick to get Firefox 3 to refresh from the site instead of from cache, and it is to load a few other sites in the same window by opening up new Tabs. This "workaround" however is intermittent.
This POST response caching issue is plaguing an application that I am working on, with secured information shown back to the user via browser cache history. If there is a way to speed up the process of getting this fixed, the more secured and caching standard compliant Firefox is.

Not following no-cache or no-store directives for https is really bad. [Comment 58](/show_bug.cgi?id=441751#c58 "RESOLVED FIXED - Directives not to cache pages ignored.") sums it up. This needs to block.Flags: blocking1.9.1?Flags: blocking1.9.0.6?

OK, this is definitely a regression from [bug 373231](/show_bug.cgi?id=373231 "RESOLVED FIXED - implement navigator.isLocallyAvailable").
The change that caused this is this part in nsHttpChannel::CheckCache:
- // If we were only granted read access, then assume the entry is valid.
- // unless it is INHBIT\_CACHING
- if (mCacheAccess == nsICache::ACCESS\_READ &&
- !(mLoadFlags & INHIBIT\_CACHING)) {
+ // Don't bother to validate LOAD\_ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE items.
+ // Don't bother to validate items that are read-only,
+ // unless they are read-only because of INHIBIT\_CACHING.
+ if (mLoadFlags & LOAD\_ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE ||
+ (mCacheAccess == nsICache::ACCESS\_READ &&
+ !(mLoadFlags & INHIBIT\_CACHING))) {
mCachedContentIsValid = PR\_TRUE;
return NS\_OK;
}
This changed the semantics of LOAD\_ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE. Before this change, LOAD\_ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE meant to do normal validation, but abort if network access was required. LOAD\_FROM\_CACHE meant (and still means) to skip validation.
Before this change, we got into CheckCache() with the following cache-related flags set on this history traversal: VALIDATE\_NEVER|LOAD\_ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE. Our mCacheAccess was NOT ACCESS\_READ (another change the patch in [bug 373231](/show_bug.cgi?id=373231 "RESOLVED FIXED - implement navigator.isLocallyAvailable") made for LOAD\_ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE), so we skipped that first return. Neither LOAD\_FROM\_CACHE not VALIDATE\_ALWAYS were set, so we ended up in the VALIDATE\_NEVER case, which checked for no-store or SSL no-cache and forced validation, with a comment pointing to [bug 112564](/show_bug.cgi?id=112564 "RESOLVED FIXED - Cache-Control: no-cache should not affect back/forward buttons"). This bug is basically a regression of [bug 112564](/show_bug.cgi?id=112564 "RESOLVED FIXED - Cache-Control: no-cache should not affect back/forward buttons"). Now we bail out without validation on that early return whose condition got changed, and hence don't hit the condition in Connect() that says to abort if validation is needed and LOAD\_ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE is set.
Note that docshell explicitly adds LOAD\_ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE only to POST history loads, so it was most certainly depending on the old behavior.
What needs to happen is one of two things:
1) Restore the old meaning of LOAD\_ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE without LOAD\_FROM\_CACHE
(don't force read-only, don't force skip-validation, don't force reading
from cache, only force not hitting the network).
2) Provide docshell with some other way of triggering the desired behavior.
I think #1 is the way to go. Offline code should set both flags if that's the behavior it wants (forced reading from cache \_and\_ forced not hitting the network) instead of changing the meaning of LOAD\_ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE.Blocks: [373231](/show_bug.cgi?id=373231 "RESOLVED FIXED - implement navigator.isLocallyAvailable")

Oh, and the logic in CheckCache seems really fragile in general; in particular, the dependency on the mCacheAccess mode is really weird.

This basically reverts the changes from 373231 that were causing problems, and updates mozIsLocallyAvailable to use the pair of flags.
It also adds some tests for the various flags.
The ACCESS\_READ thing is ugly. I know that at last the offline loading was relying on it (we mark cache entries read-only to prevent validation and updating the entry), so I added a clause to that big-annoying-if that explicitly avoids validation for application cache loads, in case we want to try to remove that ACCESS\_READ check in the future.

Roughly the same patch as the trunk patch, except that we don't have mLoadedFromApplicationCache, so this DOES continue to rely on mCacheAccess == ACCESS\_READ to avoid updating an offline cache.
Note that the no-store tests assume the existence of a working memory cache. [Bug 454878](/show_bug.cgi?id=454878 "RESOLVED FIXED - PR_GetPhysicalMemorySize sometimes returns incorrect result on Mac") causes this to fail often on the branch. So before we land this patch we'll need to either a) drop the no-cache parts of the test, b) get the fix for 454878 on the branch, or c) land the workaround in 454587.

(b) is probably Very Hard, so let's do (c) or (a). I'd probably prefer (c) in any case, but we can do (a) if that hasn't happened before this wants to land on branch.

Scratch that, looks like 454878 is included on the branch now, I was out of date.

Other than that, looks good. I didn't review the test very carefully; let me know if you think I should.
That said, the test only tests http://. There's a behavior difference for https://: no-cache https should behave just like no-store as far as validation is concerned. Would be good to test that too.

Honza, how tough would it be to add the ssltunnel stuff you did for mochitest to an xpcshell unit test?

xpc-shell tests run server as instance of an xpc component. ssltunnel is an executable that has to be run with reference to a configuration file as an argument. the configuration file tells the ssltunnel on which port(s) to listen and which certificates to present on them, to which address and port to forward (to nsHttpServer) and where the cert db is located. also it can configure the ssltunnel as an http(s) proxy allowing additional customizations or just a pure ssl tunnel.
if you don't want more then to connect to e.g. <https://localhost:4443/>, then we have to create a new directory with cert db and the ssltunnel config file dedicated to xpc-shell tests. it would be static, no run-time changes needed. ssltunnel has to be run on demand, best from a test as the server is instantiated, using some helper function. I can imagine ssltunnel be turned to a component what would be much more elegant and flexible, but it is a lot of work.
so, what I need for the simplest functionality is:
- decide on location of the config files (e.g. tools\test-harness\xpcshell-simple installed to obj-dir\\_tests\xpcshell-simple\sslsupport)
- create a server cert for 'localhost', self signed or signed by the pgo ca, and check-in a cert db containing it
- at run-time add this self signed cert or the pgo ca to profile cert db of the xpcshell test environment as trusted or install on all channels an nsIBadCertListener2 to accept untrusted certificate
- create a helper function to run the ssltunnel process as simply as possible
- make sure to kill the ssltunnel process at the end

As far as I can tell, this particular bug has made Firefox 3 to be excluded from online elections ("élections prud'homales") in France, causing quite some stir... FX3 was excluded because it enabled other people that would come to your desktop and hit back to see for who you had voted, I was told. I'm not positive about this since I have not received confirmation for the different parties, but this bug is the closest thing I can find that could have led to FX3 being rejected. Glad to see this regression fixed!

... and this caused problems, because it prevents us from validating when updating the offline cache.
This patch always forces validation (or at least bypasses the ACCESS\_READ check) when we're updating the offline cache.

The bug that the new attachment fixed was not in the patch for the 1.9.0 patch, we don't need a new patch there.

The tests are failing on mac unit test boxes, testing really simple max-age=0 caching that wasn't changed by this patch. If the unit tests aren't getting a profile dir on the test boxes, the nspr bug would cause this.
The tests are passing on linux and windows, and on trunk they're passing on all three platforms.
I talked with ss, and I'm going to remove the test for now. I filed [bug 470530](/show_bug.cgi?id=470530 "RESOLVED FIXED - re-land tests for bug 441751") to reland once either the new nspr or the workaround in 454587 hits the branch.Depends on: [470530](/show_bug.cgi?id=470530 "RESOLVED FIXED - re-land tests for bug 441751")

I've tested the latest Minefield build and indeed it shows \_warnings\_ and then to my dismay offers to resubmit posted data. Other browsers, like IE7 and Chrome simply show a page expired page, with no chance of careless resubmitting any data by hitting "ok" button on a message box. The current FF behavior simply provides an interceptor message box as hack fix for a huge problem which is in my opinion not secure enough.
Please honor the cache-control directives in the most secure way, as Firefox is positioned as a secure browser which at this point it's not, as far as caching behavior is concerned.

Whether to resubmit POST data is, and must be, the user's choice.

And as testing shows, the general accepted behaviour by all browsers. Case closed.

(In reply to [comment #58](/show_bug.cgi?id=441751#c58 "RESOLVED FIXED - Directives not to cache pages ignored."))
Cache-Control directives are targeted at HTTP caches, and RFC2616 explicitly states that caches and history lists are separate; see <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html#sec13.13>
In particular, see the note at the end.
I'm concerned that while this text is confusing and indeed not very helpful at the moment, re-defining the semantics of existing cache directives in an ad hoc fashion is going to create more confusion and interoperability problems. In other words, we need to document this better, especially if the way that the directives work is going to change.
The HTTPbis Working Group in the IETF is chartered to revise RFC2616, so this is a good opportunity to do that; for example, we could:
\* Rewrite section 13.13 to explicitly define CC: no-store as applying to history lists (which is within HTTPbis' charter), or
\* Define one or more new directives to explicitly control history lists (which isn't in HTTPbis' charter, but we can provide a forum for discussion and feedback), or
\* Refine the text in other ways.
To make that happen, however, we need browser vendors (you) to actively participate in discussions; ideally, making proposals for text changes.
You can see the current drafts at:
<http://tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/>
and participate on the list at:
<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/>
I've raised a HTTPbis ticket regarding this particular issue at:
<http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/ticket/197>
(I'll leave it up to you to dediced whether to reopen this, open a new bug, etc.)

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=483150#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-01-29 20:52:06 UTC  ``` Paul Nel reported that certain HTTP directives to not cache web pages, Cache-Control: no-store and Cache-Control: no-cache for HTTPS pages, were being ignored by Firefox 3. On a shared system, applications relying upon these HTTP directives could potentially expose private data. Another user on the system could use this vulnerability to view improperly cached pages containing private data by navigating the browser back.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=483150#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-02-04 08:17:17 UTC  ``` Public now via MFSA 2009-06: <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2009/mfsa2009-06.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=483150#c3)  Fedora Update System    2009-02-06 05:20:13 UTC  ``` xulrunner-1.9.0.6-1.fc10, firefox-3.0.6-1.fc10, epiphany-extensions-2.24.0-4.fc10, epiphany-2.24.3-2.fc10, blam-1.8.5-6.fc10, devhelp-0.22-3.fc10, evolution-rss-0.1.2-4.fc10, galeon-2.0.7-5.fc10, gecko-sharp2-0.13-4.fc10, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-26.fc10, gnome-web-photo-0.3-14.fc10, google-gadgets-0.10.5-2.fc10, kazehakase-0.5.6-1.fc10.3, Miro-1.2.8-2.fc10, mozvoikko-0.9.5-6.fc10, mugshot-1.2.2-5.fc10, pcmanx-gtk2-0.3.8-5.fc10, ruby-gnome2-0.18.1-3.fc10, yelp-2.24.0-5.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.
