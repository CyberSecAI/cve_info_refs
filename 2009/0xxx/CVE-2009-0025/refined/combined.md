**oCERT-2008-016 multiple OpenSSL signature verification API misuse**

**Description**:

Several functions inside the [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org)
library incorrectly check the result after calling the EVP\_VerifyFinal function.

This bug allows a malformed signature to be treated as a good signature
rather than as an error. This issue affects the signature checks on DSA and
ECDSA keys used with SSL/TLS.

The flaw may be exploited by a malicious server or a man-in-the-middle
attack that presents a malformed SSL/TLS signature from a certificate chain to
a vulnerable client, bypassing validation.

A patch fixing the issue with proper return code checking and further
important recommendations are described in the original OpenSSL Team
advisory.

At the request of the OpenSSL team, oCERT has aided in the remediation
coordination for other projects with similar API misuse vulnerabilities.
In addition to EVP\_VerifyFinal, the return codes from DSA\_verify and
DSA\_do\_verify functions were being incorrectly validated, and packages
doing so are affected in a similar fashion as OpenSSL.

**Affected version**:

[OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org) <= 0.9.8i [1]

The following packages were identified as affected by the same OpenSSL
vulnerability, as they use OpenSSL EVP\_VerifyFinal function and incorrectly
check the return code.

[NTP](http://www.ntp.org) <= 4.2.4p5 (production), <= 4.2.5p150 (development)

[Sun GridEngine](http://gridengine.sunsource.net) <= 5.3

[Gale](http://www.gale.org) <= 0.99

[OpenEvidence](http://www.openevidence.org) <= 1.0.6

[Belgian eID middleware - eidlib](http://eid.belgium.be) <= 2.6.0 [2]

Freedom Network Server <= 2.x

The following packages were identified as affected by a vulnerability
similar to the OpenSSL one, as they use OpenSSL DSA\_verify and/or DSA\_do\_verify function and
incorrectly check the return code.

[BIND](http://www.isc.org) <= 9.4.3

[BIND](http://www.isc.org) 9.0 (all versions), 9.1 (all versions), >= 9.3.0 & <= 9.3.6, >= 9.4.0 & <= 9.4.3, 9.5.0, 9.5.1, 9.6.0

[Lasso](http://lasso.entrouvert.org) <= 2.2.1

[ZXID](http://www.zxid.org) <= 0.29

1 - use of OpenSSL as an SSL/TLS client when connecting to a server
whose certificate uses an RSA key is **NOT** affected. Verification of
client certificates by OpenSSL servers for any key type is **NOT**
affected.

2 - Belgian eID middleware latest versions are not available in source
form, therefore we cannot confirm if they are affected

**Fixed version**:

[OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org) >= 0.9.8j

[NTP](http://www.ntp.org) >= 4.2.4p6 (production), >= 4.2.5p153 (development)

[Sun GridEngine](http://gridengine.sunsource.net) >= 6.0

[Gale](http://www.gale.org), N/A

[OpenEvidence](http://www.openevidence.org), N/A

[Belgian eID middleware - eidlib](http://eid.belgium.be), N/A

Freedom Network Server, N/A

[BIND](http://www.isc.org) >= 9.3.6-P1, >= 9.4.3-P1, >= 9.5.1-P1, >= 9.6.0-P1

[Lasso](http://lasso.entrouvert.org) >= 2.2.2

[ZXID](http://www.zxid.org), N/A

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#####

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Updated OpenSSL package for the Service Console fixes a security issue.
OpenSSL 0.9.7a-33.24 and earlier does not properly check the return value from the EVP\_VerifyFinal function, which could allow a remote attacker to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature for DSA and ECDSA keys.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-5077 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

b. Update bind package for the Service Console fixes a security issue.
A flaw was discovered in the way Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) checked the return value of the OpenSSL DSA\_do\_verify function. On systems using DNSSEC, a malicious zone could present a malformed DSA certificate and bypass proper certificate validation, allowing spoofing attacks.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2009-0025 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

\* hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

#####

c. Updated vim package for the Service Console addresses several security issues.
Several input flaws were found in Visual editor IMproved's (Vim) keyword and tag handling. If Vim looked up a document's maliciously crafted tag or keyword, it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-4101 to this issue.
A heap-based overflow flaw was discovered in Vim's expansion of file name patterns with shell wildcards. An attacker could create a specially crafted file or directory name, when opened by Vim causes the application to stop responding or execute arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-3432 to this issue. Several input flaws were found in various Vim system functions. If a user opened a specially crafted file, it was possible to execute arbitrary code as the user running Vim.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2008-2712 to this issue. A format string flaw was discovered in Vim's help tag processor. If a user was tricked into executing the "helptags" command on malicious data, arbitrary code could be executed with the permissions of the user running VIM.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2007-2953 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

Would someone be able to provide some more details as to what
particular configurations of BIND this affects? My interpretation is
it only impacts recursive nameservers that have DNSSEC validation
enabled. Speaking in terms of BIND config options, the dnssec-
validation option would need to be set to yes (so just having the
default of dnssec-enable set to yes isn't enough to make the server
vulnerable). Is this a correct interpretation?

Thanks,
Dave Coulthart

The OpenSSL vulnerability affects DSA and ECDSA certificates; an
attacker is able to bypass validation of the certificate. Since DNSSEC
uses ECDSA, this means an attacker could use a forged certificate in a
man-in-the-middle attack.

If you're not using DNSSEC, then this vulnerability doesn't really
affect you, since you already have no way of knowing if a MITM attack is
occurring.

And not even all of those. It only affects DSA signatures (RSA is not
affected), and only if an attacker can provoke a rather peculiar error
condition.

The root problem, which was also behind the recent OpenSSL release, is
that a couple of the low-level OpenSSL libcrypto library functions
that deal with DSA signatures return a tri-state value rather than a
boolean: 1 == success, 0 == bad signature, -1 == other failure (eg,
malloc() failure). The corresponding RSA functions return boolean
values, this is a peculiarity of the DSA routines. Due to the, um,
minimal nature of the OpenSSL internals documentation, a lot of code
that calls the OpenSSL DSA was not checking the error returns
correctly, and was misinterpreting "other" errors as success. Among
others, affected code included both a few routines in BIND's DNSSEC
code and portions of OpenSSL itself (if you look closely at the recent
OpenSSL release, you'll see that there were a bunch of little changes
in libssl to fix this).

So an attacker trying to exploit this vulnerablity would have to
provoke an "other" error while the victim was validating a DSA
signature. This is pretty freaking unlikely, hence the "Severity:
low" rating on the BIND security advisory, but as nobody can prove
that this can't be done and BIND really wasn't checking the return
code correctly, it seemed best to handle the fix as a security issue.

"Vulnerable" in this case means "could be tricked into believing
DNSSEC signatures that should not have passed validation". That is,
we're not talking about named crashing here, we're talking about a
security mechanism not working as expected due to a bug.

If you don't have DNSSEC validation enabled you presumably have no
expectation that DNSSEC signatures will be checked correctly, so,
indeed, you are "not affected", in that without DNSSEC there are
easier ways to feed you bad data.

s/certificate/RRSIG/ (DNSSEC doesn't use certificates).

Exactly.

FreeBSD-SA-09:04.bind Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: BIND DNSSEC incorrect checks for malformed signatures
Category: contrib
Module: bind
Announced: 2009-01-13
Credits: Google Security Team
Affects: All supported FreeBSD versions
Corrected: 2009-01-10 03:00:21 UTC (RELENG\_7, 7.1-STABLE)
2009-01-13 21:19:27 UTC (RELENG\_7\_1, 7.1-RELEASE-p2)
2009-01-13 21:19:27 UTC (RELENG\_7\_0, 7.0-RELEASE-p9)

CVE Name: CVE-2009-0025
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
BIND 9 is an implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.
The named(8) daemon is an Internet Domain Name Server. DNS Security
Extensions (DNSSEC) are additional protocol options that add
authentication as part of responses to DNS queries.
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL
Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
commercial-grade, full-featured Open Source toolkit implementing the
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1)
protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography
library.
II. Problem Description
The DSA\_do\_verify() function from OpenSSL is used to determine if a
DSA digital signature is valid. When DNSSEC is used within BIND it
uses DSA\_do\_verify() to verify DSA signatures, but checks the function
return value incorrectly.
III. Impact
It is in theory possible to spoof a DNS reply even though DNSSEC
is set up to validate answers. This could be used by an attacker for
man-in-the-middle or other spoofing attacks.
IV. Workaround
Disable the the DSA algorithm in named.conf. This will cause answers
from zones signed only with DSA to be treated as insecure. Add the
following to the options section of named.conf:
disable-algorithms . { DSA; };
NOTE WELL: If named(8) is not explicitly set to use DNSSEC the setup is
not vulnerable to the issue as described in this Security Advisory.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 6-STABLE, or 7-STABLE, or to the
RELENG\_7\_1, RELENG\_7\_0, RELENG\_6\_4, or RELENG\_6\_3 security branch
dated after the correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 6.3, 6.4,
7.0, and 7.1 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-09:04/bind.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-09:04/bind.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/bind
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# cd /usr/src/usr.sbin/named
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# /etc/rc.d/named restart
c) Install and use a fixed version of BIND from the FreeBSD Ports
Collection.

# Google Groups ending support for Usenet

If you work with Usenet groups in Google Groups, support for these groups is ending soon.

## What’s changing?

Starting on February 22, 2024, you can no longer use Google Groups (at groups.google.com) to post content to Usenet groups, subscribe to Usenet groups, or view new Usenet content. You can continue to view and search for historical Usenet content posted before February 22, 2024 on Google Groups.

In addition, Google’s Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) server and associated peering will no longer be available, meaning Google will not support serving new Usenet content or exchanging content with other NNTP servers.

This change will not impact any non-Usenet content on Google Groups, including all user and organization-created groups. Most of the current Google Groups content  is not Usenet content and will not be affected.

## What do I need to do?

If you don’t actively engage with Usenet content, you don’t need to do anything. Current Usenet users will need to do two things before February 22, 2024 if they want to continue engaging with Usenet content:

1. **Find a new Usenet client.** Several free and paid alternatives are available, both web-based and application-based. To find a client, do a web search for "how do I find a usenet text client"
2. **Find a new public Usenet server.** The new client you choose will likely have a default server or a set of curated options for you. If not, to find a server, do a web search for "public NNTP servers."

Because Usenet is a distributed system, **you do not need to migrate data**. All of the Usenet content you can access today on Google Groups should already be synced to the new server you choose. After you select a new client and server, you can reselect the groups you’re interested in.

## Why is Google Groups support for Usenet ending?

Over the last several years, legitimate activity in text-based Usenet groups has declined significantly because users have moved to more modern technologies and formats such as social media and web-based forums. Much of the content being disseminated via Usenet today is binary (non-text) file sharing, which Google Groups does not support, as well as spam.

* **001: SECURITY FIX: November 2, 2008**
    *All architectures*

  The Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ndp) did not correctly verify neighbor
  solicitation requests maybe allowing a nearby attacker to intercept traffic.
  The attacker must have IPv6 connectivity to the same router as their target for
  this vulnerability to be exploited.
  [CVE-2008-2476](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2476).

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/001_ndp.patch)

  * **002: RELIABILITY FIX: November 2, 2008**
      *All architectures*

    Due to a bug in the vr(4) driver it is possible for a system using the vr(4)
    driver to panic under heavy load if the RX path runs out of mbufs.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/002_vr.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: November 6, 2008**
        *All architectures*

      Fix the IPv4 TCP/IP stack's TIME\_WAIT socket recycling. Due to the bug this
      can result in TCP connections between two IPs being reset instead of accepted
      if being received on a socket in the TIME\_WAIT state.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/003_tcpinput.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 6, 2008**
          *All architectures*

        Fix
        [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.4/httpd.8)'s
        mod\_proxy module which is broken on 64-bit architectures. Due to the bug this
        will result in child processes crashing when utilizing proxy rules during an
        HTTP session.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/004_httpd.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: November 7, 2008**
            *All architectures*

          A software bug could cause memory allocation to cause a kernel panic
          accessing an array out of its bounds, when physical memory is exhausted.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/005_pglistalloc.patch)

          * **006: RELIABILITY FIX: November 19, 2008**
              *All architectures*

            Due to changes in the options handling this caused problems with some
            DHCP clients such as Solaris/OpenSolaris and some embedded routers not
            accepting DHCP offers.

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/006_dhcpd.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: January 9, 2009**
                *All architectures*

              The OpenSSL libraries did not correctly check the return value from
              certain verification functions, allowing validation to be bypassed and
              permitting a remote attacker to conduct a "man in the middle attack"
              against SSL/TLS connections if the server is configured with a DSA or ECDSA
              certificate.
              [CVE-2008-5077](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5077).

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/007_openssl.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: January 14, 2009**
                  *All architectures*

                named(8) did not correctly check the return value of a DSA verification
                function, potentially allowing bypass of verification of DNSSEC DSA
                signatures.
                [CVE-2009-0025](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0025).

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/008_bind.patch)

                * **009: RELIABILITY FIX: January 30, 2009**
                    *All architectures*

                  Upon reception of an invalid update with 4-byte AS attributes, bgpd -
                  adhering to the RFCs - closed the session to the neighbor.
                  This error in the specification allowed 3rd parties to close remote BGP
                  sessions.
                  In the worst case Internet connectivity could be lost.

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/009_bgpd.patch)

                  * **010: RELIABILITY FIX: February 18, 2009**
                      *All architectures*

                    bgpd(8) did not correctly prepend its own AS to very long AS paths, causing
                    the process to terminate because of the resulting corrupt path.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/010_bgpd.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: February 22, 2009**
                        *All architectures*

                      sudo(8) may allow a user listed in the sudoers file to run a command
                      as a different user than their access rule specifies when a Unix
                      group is used in the RunAs portion of the rule. The bug only manifests
                      when the user being granted privileges is also a member of the group
                      in the RunAs portion of the rule.

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/011_sudo.patch)

                      * **012: RELIABILITY FIX: April 8, 2009**
                          *All architectures*

                        The OpenSSL ASN.1 handling code could be forced to perform invalid memory
                        accesses through the use of certain invalid strings
                        ([CVE-2009-0590](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0590))
                        or under certain error conditions triggerable by invalid ASN.1 structures
                        ([CVE-2009-0789](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0789)).
                        These vulnerabilities could be exploited to achieve a
                        denial-of-service. A more detailed description of these problems is available
                        in the
                        [OpenSSL security advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20090325.txt), but note that the other issue described there "Incorrect Error
                        Checking During CMS verification" relates to code not enabled in OpenBSD.

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/012_openssl.patch)

                        * **013: RELIABILITY FIX: April 11, 2009**
                            *All architectures*

                          When pf attempts to perform translation on a specially crafted IP datagram,
                          a null pointer dereference will occur, resulting in a kernel panic.
                          In certain configurations this may be triggered by a remote attacker.

                          Restricting translation rules to protocols that are specific to the IP version
                          in use, is an effective workaround until the patch can be installed. As an
                          example, for IPv4 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
                          ```

                              nat/rdr ... inet proto { tcp udp icmp } ...

                          ```
                          Or for IPv6 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
                          ```

                              nat/rdr ... inet6 proto { tcp udp icmp6 } ...

                          ```
                          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/013_pf.patch)

                          * **014: RELIABILITY FIX: July 29, 2009**
                              *All architectures*

                            A vulnerability has been found in BIND's named server
                            ([CVE-2009-0696](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0696)).
                            An attacker could crash a server with a specially crafted dynamic update message to a
                            zone for which the server is master.

                            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.4/common/014_bind.patch)

                            * **015: RELIABILITY FIX: October 05, 2009**
                                *i386 only*

                              XMM exceptions are not correctly handled resulting in a kernel panic.

                              * **016: RELIABILITY FIX: October 28, 2009**
                                  *All architectures*

                                getsockopt(2) with any of IP\_AUTH\_LEVEL, IP\_ESP\_TRANS\_LEVEL, IP\_ESP\_NETWORK\_LEVEL,
                                IP\_IPCOMP\_LEVEL will crash the system.

  Impact: Visiting a malicious website via a proxy may result in cross-site scripting

  Description: An input validation issue exists in Apache's handling of FTP proxy requests containing wildcard characters. Visiting a malicious website via an Apache proxy may result in a cross-site scripting attack. This update addresses the issue by applying the Apache patch for version 2.0.63. Further information is available via the Apache web site at <http://httpd.apache.org/> Apache 2.0.x is only shipped with Mac OS X Server v10.4.x systems. Mac OS X v10.5.x and Mac OS X Server v10.5.x ship with Apache 2.2.x.

* **Apache**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-2939

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Visiting a malicious website via a proxy may result in cross-site scripting

  Description: An input validation issue exists in Apache 2.2.9's handling of FTP proxy requests containing wildcard characters. Visiting a malicious website via an Apache proxy may result in a cross-site scripting attack. This update addresses the issue by updating Apache to version 2.2.11. Further information is available via the Apache web site at <http://httpd.apache.org/>

* **Apache**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-0456

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Web sites that allow users to control the name of a served file may be vulnerable to HTTP response injection

  Description: A request forgery issue exists in Apache. Apache does not escape filenames when negotiating the correct content type to send to a remote browser. A user who can publish files with specially crafted names to a web site can substitute their own response for any web page hosted on the system. This update addresses the issue by escaping filenames in content negotiation responses.

* **ATS**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0154

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded CFF font may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in Apple Type Services' handling of Compact Font Format (CFF) fonts. Viewing or downloading a document containing a maliciously crafted embedded CFF font may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. Credit to Charlie Miller of Independent Security Evaluators working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative for reporting this issue.

* **BIND**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0025

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.6

  Impact: BIND is susceptible to a spoofing attack if configured to use DNSSEC

  Description: BIND incorrectly checks the return value of the OpenSSL DSA\_do\_verify function. On systems using the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) protocol, a maliciously crafted DSA certificate could bypass the validation, which may lead to a spoofing attack. By default, DNSSEC is not enabled. This update addresses the issue by updating BIND to version 9.3.6-P1 on Mac OS X v10.4, and version 9.4.3-P1 for Mac OS X v10.5 systems. Further information is available via the ISC web site at <https://www.isc.org/>
