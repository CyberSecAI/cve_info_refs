{
  "CVE-2009-0025": {
    "Description": "The BIND DNS server incorrectly checks the return value of the OpenSSL DSA_do_verify function. On systems using DNSSEC, a maliciously crafted DSA certificate could bypass the validation, leading to a spoofing attack.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect return value check from OpenSSL's DSA_do_verify function within BIND's DNSSEC validation process.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper return code validation from the DSA_do_verify function.",
      "Vulnerable to spoofing due to bypassed signature validation."
    ],
    "Impact": "Spoofing of DNS replies, man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious DNS server presenting a malformed DSA certificate.",
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks where a forged DSA signature is introduced."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to manipulate DNS traffic or act as a malicious DNS server.",
       "Needs to be able to provoke a specific error condition when validating a DSA signature"
    ],
    "Additional Details": [
      "The vulnerability is specific to the DSA algorithm; RSA is not affected.",
      "The issue was caused by OpenSSL returning a tri-state value (1, 0, -1) rather than a boolean, with '-1' being incorrectly treated as a success.",
      "The vulnerability only affects recursive nameservers that have DNSSEC validation enabled, and specifically when validating DSA signatures. ",
        "Exploitation requires an attacker to provoke a specific error state during the signature verification, making it low severity.",
        "Patches involve correctly checking the return codes from the OpenSSL function"
    ]
  }
