Subject: CVE request -- Python < 2.6 PySys_SetArgv issues (epiphany,
	csound, dia, eog, gedit, xchat, vim, nautilus-python, Gnumeric)

Hello Steve,

  initially CVE-2008-4863 has been assigned for the Blender's
untrusted search path issue.

Though this is a Python flaw (insertion of cwd at the
beginning of the Python modules search path), according to our Python
maintainers it can't be fixed on Python's side due the need
of ensuring the work of other numerous packages, when loading
Python modules.

Similar flaw, like the Blender one, has been discovered in
the following packages:

1, epiphany

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# gedit: Untrusted search path — GLSA **200903-41**

A vulnerability in gedit might allow local attackers to execute arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-editors/gedit** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.24.3** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.22.3-r1**>= **2.24.3** |

### Background

gedit is a text editor for the GNOME desktop.

### Description

James Vega reported that gedit uses the current working directory when
searching for python modules, a vulnerability related to CVE-2008-5983.

### Impact

A local attacker could entice a user to open gedit from a specially
crafted environment, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

Do not run gedit from untrusted working directories.

### Resolution

All gedit 2.22.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-editors/gedit-2.22.3-r1"
```

All gedit 2.24.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-editors/gedit-2.24.3"
```

I haven't tested it yet. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=569214#c2)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2009-01-26 19:02:46 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 127279](attachment.cgi?id=127279 "Test case.")

[[details]](attachment.cgi?id=127279&action=edit "Test case.") doesn't fix the issue. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=569214#c5)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2009-01-26 21:19:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 127294](attachment.cgi?id=127294 "one line patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=127294&action=edit "one line patch") [[review]](review?bug=569214&attachment=127294) one line patch  I also tried to doing the equivalent code in C using Py_GetPath, PySys_SetPath (and filtering with a GPtrArray, g_strsplit, a for loop, and g_strjoinv), but it didn't work either.  The above one line patch seems to work though. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=569214#c6)  Paolo Borelli    2009-01-27 08:43:43 UTC  ``` I read the original vim bugreport and I tend to agree that this should be probably fixed in python since we follow verbatim the suggested way to setup python in their docs, so this probably affect any program embedding python and should be fixed in one place.  That said, if we go for the workaround, I do not like the last patch much since we've moved away from hardcoded an "plugin_dir" specified at build time (it was necessary for the win32 port). I guess we can pick another safe path... "/usr/bin/gedit" (well, $PREFIX/bin/gedit) seems a natural choice since argv[0] usually contains the binary path, and in this case we would use the absolute binary path.  We just have to check that it doesn't conflit with e.g. an hypotetic "pythonconsole" program in /usr/bin... in other words I am not sure if passing the path to a binary is ok, or if we are forced to set the path to a dir. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=569214#c7)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2009-01-27 14:37:09 UTC  ``` I think it probably makes more sense to specify a path that gedit has complete control over, so the hole doesn't accidentally open up again.  It could be any directory or file I guess, as long as it's not shared between projects.  maybe $DATADIR/gedit ?  Of course if we can get this fixed in python that's even better. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=569214#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-01-28 10:39:36 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier CVE-2009-0314 to this vulnerability:  Untrusted search path vulnerability in the Python module in gedit allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory, related to a vulnerability in the PySys_SetArgv function (CVE-2008-5983).

However there is another attack vector: shipping a file that replaces a module imported by a plugin configured to run.

In the meantime, applications have to work around this bug. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=569214#c16)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2009-04-08 15:41:39 UTC  ``` I think it should be possible to fix in Python without breaking a lot of apps.  I even did a patch for it that I gave to Jan (one of the guys on the Red Hat security team).  Not sure what the status of it is. ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=569214#c17)  Paolo Borelli    2009-04-12 15:55:43 UTC  ``` for the record the reason why the workaround is not applied upstream is because in the patch the dummy path it feeds to python is fixed at compile time while gedit figures out the the python plugins path at run time these days, so the proposed patch would break on windows where the installation is relocable.  I really hope python get its acts together as soon as possible... otherwise we need to figure out a different dummy path to use. ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=569214#c18)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-04-14 12:04:50 UTC  ``` Link to Python tracker:  <http://bugs.python.org/issue5753> ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=569214#c19)  Paolo Borelli    2010-06-27 19:53:52 UTC  ``` reassigning this to libpeas that now takes care of embedding python for us.
