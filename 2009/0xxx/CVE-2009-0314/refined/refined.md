{
  "cve": "CVE-2009-0314",
  "description": "The PySys_SetArgv function in Python before 2.6, when used in setuid programs, inserts the current working directory into the Python module search path, which allows local users to execute arbitrary Python code by creating a Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory.",
  "affected_packages": [
    "epiphany",
    "csound",
    "dia",
    "eog",
    "gedit",
    "xchat",
    "vim",
    "nautilus-python",
    "Gnumeric"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way `PySys_SetArgv` in Python before 2.6 handles the module search path when a setuid program is involved. The function incorrectly prepends the current working directory to the Python module search path.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default module search path",
      "Use of current working directory in module search path"
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can execute arbitrary Python code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application. This can lead to privilege escalation or complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access to the system is required. An attacker needs to place a malicious python file in a directory and then entice the victim to execute the vulnerable application from that directory.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to write files to a directory and to convince the victim to execute a vulnerable application from that directory."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "related_cve": "CVE-2008-5983",
    "workaround": "Do not run affected applications from untrusted working directories.",
    "resolution": "Upgrade to the patched versions of the affected software which sanitize the python module search path."
