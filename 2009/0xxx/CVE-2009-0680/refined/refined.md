Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-0680:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in a proprietary CGI binary used by the Netgear SSL312 VPN router. This CGI binary is located at `./NG_SSL312-GPL/uClinux/uC-src/real/EasyAccess/EasyAccess/www/cgi-bin/single_cgi`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability is specifically a path traversal issue. By modifying the URL with `../../../../../`, an attacker can manipulate the web interface to access files/directories that they should not have access to, which leads to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service. The router will crash and require a hard reboot to restore functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack is performed remotely via the web interface of the Netgear SSL312 router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Web Interface:** The attacker needs to have access to the web interface of the vulnerable Netgear SSL312 VPN router. This implies that the attacker must be able to reach the router's web interface which may be exposed to the internet or accessible from within the same network as the router.
- **Ability to modify URL:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the URL in their web request.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit involves manipulating the URL to include `../../../../../` after the `VPN_only?` parameter in the web interface's request. This input is not properly sanitized and is passed to a vulnerable proprietary CGI binary which crashes when the traversal occurs.
-  The vulnerability is present in the proprietary CGI binary used by the router, making it impossible for users to patch the vulnerability by themselves.
-  The advisory also mentions the use of Google dorks (`intitle:SSL-VPN intext:password inurl:/cgi-bin/welcome`) to locate potentially vulnerable devices on the internet.
-  The vulnerability was discovered by a researcher named "Rembrandt" on 2008-02-27.
-  The vendor was contacted via the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) and was unresponsive.  Netgear and Mitre.org were contacted, but also did not react.  This led to the public release of the vulnerability information.
-  The exploit also indicates the presence of other issues, such as outdated third party software (e.g. the webserver) and other problems in the cgi-binary itself which are not disclosed.
