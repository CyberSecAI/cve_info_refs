# We believe in

Wirecore is a Estonian private company created to manage its own assets. The company's goal is to preserve, diversify and increase equity capital with well balanced risk.

# OurPrinciples

* Use of own capital only
* For our investments, we do not attract capital from outside, we use only the ownerâs capital

* Pure origin of money
* All capital at our disposal has a clean, fully traceable origin from risk-free sources

* Diversification
* We carefully diversify capital by investing both in very low-risk assets, such as real estate, and in high-risk short-term trading operations, such as foreign exchange markets

* Well balanced risks
* For high-risk transactions, we use a very small part of the capital, preferring to store most of the capital in the form of highly liquid assets that are constantly rising in price

* Only bona fide counterparties
* We carefully select only the best partners and always check where the money comes from, avoiding all sources even with potential risks

# CounterpartiesInteraction

**We interact with counterparties in just a few situations:**

* - buying or selling real estate
* - buying or selling other property
* - renting out real estate
* - property maintenance
* - brokers for trading operations
