Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-0472:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The web interface of the Rockwell Automation ControlLogix 1756-ENBT/A EtherNet/IP Bridge does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The primary vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw.
- Multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist within the web interface of the affected device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within an operator's web browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Spoofing of displayed data on the legitimate Rockwell web interface.
    - Redirection of the operator's browser to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to convince a user/operator to click on a specially crafted URL that contains malicious script.
- The attack requires social engineering to trick the victim into visiting the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to somehow get a user to visit that URL.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the Rockwell device, but a user who does needs to be tricked into clicking the malicous URL.
