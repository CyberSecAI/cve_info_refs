Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-0163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow in the `_cupsImageReadTIFF()` function within the CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) TIFF image decoding routines.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of image dimensions when processing TIFF files. Specifically, a large height value can cause an integer overflow.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:**  The integer overflow in image height calculation leads to a heap-based buffer overflow when memory is allocated for the image processing, potentially overwriting other data on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the CUPS daemon (typically the `lp` user). This can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted TIFF image may also cause the CUPS service to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious TIFF File:** An attacker crafts a malicious TIFF image file with specific dimensions designed to trigger the integer overflow.
*  **Printing:** The attacker needs to make the CUPS server process this malicious TIFF file (for example, by printing it).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access (Potentially):** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely if they have access to a CUPS server configured to accept network print jobs or if they trick a user to process such image.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects the "imagetops" and "imagetoraster" filters in CUPS.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Aaron Sigel of the Apple Product Security team and iDefense.
*   The fix involves adjusting `CUPS_IMAGE_MAX_HEIGHT` in `filter/image-private.h` to prevent the integer overflow.
*   The vulnerability was fixed upstream in CUPS version 1.3.10.
*   Several Linux distributions including Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian and openSUSE issued security updates to address the vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
