  "CVE-2009-0476": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Euphonics Audio Player 1.0 contains a buffer overflow vulnerability when processing a specially crafted .pls file.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Buffer Overflow.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow a local attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the application processes a malicious .pls file. This is a local attack vector, requiring the attacker to get the victim to open the crafted .pls file with the vulnerable application.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to the target system. They must also be able to craft a malicious .pls file and convince the user to open this file using the vulnerable application."

       "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted .pls file.",

      "Attack vectors": "The user must open a malicious .pls file crafted by the attacker.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position":"The attacker needs local access and the ability to create a malicious .pls file. The victim must then open this file."
