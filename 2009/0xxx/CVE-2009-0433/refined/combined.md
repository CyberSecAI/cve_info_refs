## Error description

* ```
  The change in packaging is going to be for PK63499:

      1) Allow installation on 6.1.0.17.
  (PK63499 was made before FixPack was released and does not allow
  the successful install at this level)

      2) On 64-bit builds, it will contain a 32-bit and 64-bit
  directory and will lay down both copies of executables in the
  corresponding directories.

  ****************************************************************
  * USERS AFFECTED:  All users of IBM WebSphere Application      *
  *                  Server's V6.1 web server plugin component   *
  ****************************************************************
  * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: When installing PK63499, it will not    *
  *                      allow installing on fixpack 6.1.0.17.   *
  *                      Also on 64bit architectures, this       *
  *                      package will install both 32bit and     *
  *                      64bit plugin modules.                   *
  ****************************************************************
  * RECOMMENDATION:  If running on 64bit architectures of 6.1    *
  *                  or if fix pack 6.1.0.17 is installed for    *
  *                  the WebSphere Application Server's          *
  *                  webserver plugin component, install this    *
  *                  fix.                                        *
  ****************************************************************
  Installation packaging for PK63499 will not allow it to be
  installed on fix pack 6.1.0.17 because PK63499 was released
  before the fix pack was available. Upon request, the packaging
  has also been modified to install both 32bit and 64bit plugin
  modules when installed on a 64bit architecture.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  This APAR ships a new interim fix to install on fix pack
  6.1.0.17 and the packaging has also been modified to install
  both 32bit and 64bit plugin modules when installed on a 64bit
  architecture.

  PK63499 corrected the following problem:
  Clients will experience a 500 error code and backend servers
  will be marked down.

  ```
