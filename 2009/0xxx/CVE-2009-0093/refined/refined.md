Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2009-0093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Windows DNS servers handle dynamic updates when WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) and ISATAP (Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol) are not already registered in DNS.
- Specifically, the DNS server doesn't properly validate who can register WPAD entries, allowing any user to create a registration for WPAD if it doesn't exist.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Authorization:** The core weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks for dynamic DNS updates, specifically for WPAD registration.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability:** Exploiting the lack of validation, an attacker can register a WPAD entry pointing to a malicious server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Web Proxy Spoofing:** An attacker can spoof a web proxy by controlling the WPAD entry, which browsers use to automatically detect proxy settings.
- **Traffic Redirection:** This allows the attacker to redirect Internet traffic to a server under their control, enabling interception of data, phishing attacks, or other malicious activities.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:**  The ability to redirect web traffic facilitates man-in-the-middle attacks, potentially compromising sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Authenticated Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the network to perform a dynamic DNS update on the vulnerable DNS server.
- **Dynamic DNS Update:** The attack vector involves exploiting the dynamic DNS update mechanism to register the malicious WPAD entry.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the network or have a way to send a dynamic DNS update.
- They need some level of network access and the ability to perform dynamic DNS updates if the WPAD record does not already exist.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to environments where dynamic DNS updates are used and neither WPAD nor ISATAP is already registered.
- The issue is fixed by modifying how Windows DNS servers respond to WPAD name resolution requests.
- Workarounds involve creating a legitimate WPAD.DAT proxy auto configuration file and registering it in the DNS.
- This CVE is related to other DNS vulnerabilities (CVE-2009-0233 and CVE-2009-0234) and a WINS vulnerability (CVE-2009-0094) that are addressed by the same Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS09-008).
