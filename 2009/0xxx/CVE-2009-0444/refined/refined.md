Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-0444

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to multiple Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaws in GRBoard 1.8. The application includes files using a variable that is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input validation when including files. Specifically, the `theme` parameter in various `view.php` files and the `path` parameter in `list.php` are vulnerable to remote file inclusion. The `grboard` parameter in `include.php` is also vulnerable.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to specific PHP files within the GRBoard application.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful RFI attack allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable GRBoard application.

**Affected Files and Parameters:**
   * `/theme/179_squarebox_pds_list/view.php?theme=[RFI]`
   * `/theme\179_squarebox_minishop_expand\view.php?theme=[RFI]`
