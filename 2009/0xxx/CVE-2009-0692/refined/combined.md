Package        : dhcp3
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-0692 CVE-2009-1892
CERT advisory  : VU#410676

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in ISC's DHCP
implementation:

It was discovered that dhclient does not properly handle overlong
subnet mask options, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow and
possible arbitrary code execution.  (CVE-2009-0692)

Christoph Biedl discovered that the DHCP server may terminate when
receiving certain well-formed DHCP requests, provided that the server
configuration mixes host definitions using "dhcp-client-identifier"
and "hardware ethernet".  This vulnerability only affects the lenny
versions of dhcp3-server and dhcp3-server-ldap.  (CVE-2009-1892)

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.4-13+etch2.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.1-6+lenny2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed
soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your dhcp3 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# RHSA-2009:1136 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Critical: dhcp security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1136)

## Topic

Updated dhcp packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 4.7 Extended Update Support.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that allows
individual devices on an IP network to get their own network configuration
information, including an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast
address.

The Mandriva Linux Engineering Team discovered a stack-based buffer
overflow flaw in the ISC DHCP client. If the DHCP client were to receive a
malicious DHCP response, it could crash or execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the client (root). (CVE-2009-0692)

Users of DHCP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

Note that dhclient is not the default DHCP client in Slackware's networking scripts, dhcpcd is.  However, if you use dhclient on a network where someone could deploy a hostile DHCP server, you should upgrade to the new package.  More details about this issue may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0692   Here are the details from the Slackware 12.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/dhcp-3.1.2p1-i486-1_slack12.2.tgz:  Upgraded.   A stack overflow vulnerability was fixed in dhclient that could allow   remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root on the system,   or simply terminate the client, by providing an over-long subnet-mask   option.   For more information, see:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0692   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com?

# USN-803-1: dhcp vulnerability

14 July 2009

dhcp vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [dhcp3](/security/cves?package=dhcp3) -

## Details

It was discovered that the DHCP client as included in dhcp3 did not verify

the length of certain option fields when processing a response from an IPv4

dhcp server. If a user running Ubuntu 6.06 LTS or 8.04 LTS connected to a

malicious dhcp server, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or

execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program, typically the

'dhcp' user. For users running Ubuntu 8.10 or 9.04, a remote attacker

should only be able to cause a denial of service in the DHCP client. In

Ubuntu 9.04, attackers would also be isolated by the AppArmor dhclient3

profile.

# ISC DHCP: dhcpclient Remote execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200907-12**

A buffer overflow in dhclient as included in the ISC DHCP implementation
allows for the remote execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/dhcp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.1.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.1.1-r1** |

### Background

ISC DHCP is the reference implementation of the Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol as specified in RFC 2131.

### Description

The Mandriva Linux Engineering Team has reported a stack-based buffer
overflow in the subnet-mask handling of dhclient.

### Impact

A remote attacker might set up a rogue DHCP server in a victim's local
network, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with root
privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ISC DHCP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/dhcp-3.1.1-r1"
```

## ISC DHCP dhclient stack buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#410676

Original Release Date: 2009-07-14 | Last Revised: 2009-07-29

---

### Overview

The ISC DHCP dhclient application contains a stack buffer overflow, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Description

| As described in [RFC 2131](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2131.html), "The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP network." ISC DHCP is a reference implementation of the DHCP protocol, including a DHCP server, client, and relay agent.  The ISC DHCP client code (dhclient) contains a stack buffer overflow in the script\_write\_params() method. dhclient fails to check the length of the server-supplied subnet-mask option before copying it into a buffer. According to ISC, the following versions are affected:DHCP 4.1 (all versions)DHCP 4.0 (all versions)DHCP 3.1 (all versions)DHCP 3.0 (all versions)DHCP 2.0 (all versions) |
| --- |

### Impact

| A rogue DHCP server may be able to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on a vulnerable client system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch or update from your vendor**  For vendor-specific information regarding vulnerable status and patch availability, please see the Systems Affected section of this document.**Upgrade your version of DHCP**Upgrade your system as specified by your vendor. If you need to upgrade DHCP manually, [according to ISC](https://www.isc.org/node/468):Upgrade to 4.1.0p1, 4.0.1p1, or 3.1.2p1There are no fixes planned for DHCP 3.0 or DHCP 2.0, as those release trains have reached End-Of-Life. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

NetBSD Security Advisory 2009-010
=================================
Topic: ISC dhclient subnet-mask flag stack overflow
Version: NetBSD-current: affected before June 24, 2009
NetBSD 5.0: affected
NetBSD 4.0.\*: affected
NetBSD 4.0: affected
pkgsrc: isc-dhclient package prior to
4.1.0p1, 4.0.1p1, or 3.1.2p1
Severity: Arbitrary Code Execution
Fixed: NetBSD-current: June 24, 2009
NetBSD-5-0 branch: July 14, 2009 20:00 UTC
NetBSD-5 branch: July 14, 2009 20:00 UTC
NetBSD-4-0 branch: July 14, 2009 20:00 UTC
NetBSD-4 branch: July 14, 2009 20:00 UTC
pkgsrc 2009Q2: isc-dhclient-4.1.0p1, 4.0.1p1 and
3.1.2p1 correct the issue
Abstract
========
A stack overflow vulnerability in ISC dhclient allows an attacker
operating a rogue DHCP server to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges on the affected system by supplying a specially crafted
subnet-mask parameter.
This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2009-0692 and CERT
Vulnerability Note VU#410676.
Technical Details
=================
The script\_write\_params() function in ISC dhclient version 4.1.0 and
earlier, 4.0.1 and earlier as well as 3.1.2 and earlier fails to
properly verify the subnet-mask parameter while copying it into
the internal state.
This can be exploited to overwrite the stack frame pointer and execute
arbitrary code in the context of the dhclient process. The size of the
injected code is thereby limited to the MTU of the interface dhclient
is listening on.
For more details, please see CVE-2009-0692.
Solutions and Workarounds
=========================
As a temporary workaround, disable dhclient(8) from the base OS and
use either the fixed dhclient packages from pkgsrc, or alternatively
the program dhcpcd(8) from the base system.
The following instructions describe how to upgrade your dhclient
binaries by updating your source tree and rebuilding and
installing a new version of dhclient.
\* NetBSD-current:
Systems running NetBSD-current dated from before 2009-06-24
should be upgraded to NetBSD-current dated 2009-06-25 or later.
The following file needs to be updated from the netbsd-current
CVS branch (aka HEAD):
dist/dhcp/client/dhclient.c
To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install dhclient:
# cd src
# cvs update -d -P dist/dhcp/client/dhclient.c
# cd usr.sbin/dhcp
# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
# cd client
# make USETOOLS=no install
\* NetBSD 5.\*:
Systems running NetBSD 5.\* sources dated from before
2009-07-14 20:00 UTC should be upgraded from NetBSD 5.\*
sources dated 2009-07-14 20:00 UTC or later.
The following file needs to be updated from the netbsd-5 or
netbsd-5-0 branches:
dist/dhcp/client/dhclient.c
To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install dhclient:
# cd src
# cvs update -r  -d -P dist/dhcp/client/dhclient.c
# cd usr.sbin/dhcp
# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
# cd client
# make USETOOLS=no install
Alternatively, apply the following patch (with potential offset
differences):
http://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2009-010-dhclient.patch
To patch, re-build and re-install SSH:
# cd dist/dhcp/client
# patch -p0 < /path/to/SA2009-010-dhclient.patch
# cd ../../../usr.sbin/dhcp
# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
# cd client
# make USETOOLS=no install
\* NetBSD 4.\*:
Systems running NetBSD 4.\* sources dated from before
2009-07-14 20:00 UTC should be upgraded from NetBSD 4.\*
sources dated 2009-07-14 20:00 UTC or later.
The following file needs to be updated from the netbsd-4 or
netbsd-4-0 branches:
dist/dhcp/client/dhclient.c
To update from CVS, re-build, and re-install dhclient:
# cd src
# cvs update -r  -d -P dist/dhcp/client/dhclient.c
# cd usr.sbin/dhcp
# make USETOOLS=no cleandir dependall
# cd client
# make USETOOLS=no install
Alternatively, apply the following patch (with potential offset
differences):
http://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/security/patches/SA2009-010-dhclient.patch

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The DHCP client (dhclient) could be crashed by a malicious DHCP
server sending an overlong subnet field (CVE-2009-0692).
In theory a malicious DHCP server could exploit the flaw to execute
arbitrary code as root on machines using dhclient to obtain network
settings. Newer distributions (SLES10+, openSUSE) do have buffer
overflow checking that guards against this kind of stack overflow
though. So actual exploitability is rather unlikely.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart all running instances of dhclient after the update or
reboot the machine.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

5) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds:
- ruby
- insufficient return value checks for openssl function
OCSP\_basic\_verify() (CVE-2009-0642) allowed attackers to use
revoked certificates.
- the entropy of DNS identifiers was increased to avoid spoofing
attacks (CVE-2008-3905).
- The code for parsing XML data was vulnerable to a denial of
service bug (CVE-2008-3790).
- An attack on algorithm complexity was possible in function
WEBrick::HTTP::DefaultFileHandler() while parsing HTTP requests
(CVE-2008-3656) as well as by using the regex engine
(CVE-2008-3443) causing high CPU load.
- Ruby's access restriction code (CVE-2008-3655) as well as
safe-level handling using function DL.dlopen() (CVE-2008-3657) and
big decimal handling (CVE-2009-1904) was improved.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, SLES11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- samba
- smbclient was prone to a format string vulnerability (CVE-2009-1886)
- file ACLs could potentially be bypassed when DOS filemode was
enabled (CVE-2009-1888).
Affected Products: SLES10, SLES11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libpng
libpng did not properly parse 1-bit interlaced images. Attackers
could potentially use this to read portions of memory (CVE-2009-2042).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLES10, SLES11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=507717#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-06-23 21:18:43 UTC  ``` Description from ISC's advisory:  Description:  ISC dhclient has a stack overflow vulnerability which makes it theoretically possible for a rogue DHCP server to execute arbitrary commands as root on the affected system through stack return subversion.  Impact:  While generating a subnet number from the server-supplied leased address and subnet-mask 'dhclient' copies the information into a field without verifying if the length of the information exceeds the length of the field.  Theoretically this allows a rogue DHCP server to execute arbitrary commands as root on the affected system through stack return subversion.  This attack has little to no risk for a client situated on a network that is well defended, whereas clients that are roaming to potentially hostile or ad-hoc networks can see this attack to pose a severe threat.  Factors complicating any attack would be:  1) The attacker would need to generate messages the client views as authentic.  One option is for the attacker to present itself as a suitable DHCPv4 server for a network, in essence operating as a rogue DHCPv4 server.  Another option would be to insert messages into the conversation between the client and the authentic DHCPv4 server.  To do this the attacker needs to accurately guess the client's randomly chosen 16-bit transaction ID and insert the attack precisely between the client's request and the valid DHCPv4 server's reply.  Neither of these are likely on a well defended network but clients that are roaming may find them, especially the first, a severe threat.  2) The attacker would then need to develop their attack within a limited packet size.  Support for DHCPv4 total packet size may be limited from 576 octets through the link MTU size (no support for fragmentation) up to 64KB.  Of this, the DHCPv4 option payload space is limited by the space taken up by the BOOTP header space, excepting the FILE and SNAME fields (which can be used in 'option overloading' to carry option contents, such as the subnet-mask).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=507717#c5)  Josh Bressers    2009-06-23 22:34:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 349164](attachment.cgi?id=349164&action=diff "Patch from upstream") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=349164&action=edit "Patch from upstream") Patch from upstream   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=507717#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2009-07-02 08:53:46 UTC  ``` On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later (including current Fedora versions), dhcp packages are compiled with FORTIFY_SOURCE enabled.  Thanks to that protection, this buffer overflow is detected and dhclient is terminated in a controlled way, rather than allowing malicious packet to corrupt stack and possibly result in code execution.  Therefore, this flaw has no security impact on packages built with FORTIFY_SOURCE enabled.  Malicious packet can cause dhclient to exit unexpectedly, though this is not treated as DoS.  The flaw can cause client to not have any IP address configured, however, rogue DHCP server can perform similar DoS attack on clients even without this flaw by replying to their requests with assignments of IP addresses that are not valid / usable on the given network.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=507717#c11)  Josh Bressers    2009-07-14 17:42:02 UTC  ``` This is now public: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/410676>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=507717#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-14 19:32:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:1154 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1154.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=507717#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-14 19:33:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2009:1136 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1136.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=507717#c15)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-07-15 14:47:01 UTC  ``` MITRE's CVE record ([CVE-2009-0692](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-0692)):  Stack-based buffer overflow in the script_write_params method in client/dhclient.c in ISC DHCP dhclient 4.1 before 4.1.0p1, 4.0 before 4.0.1p1, 3.1 before 3.1.2p1, 3.0, and 2.0 allows remote DHCP servers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted subnet-mask option.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
