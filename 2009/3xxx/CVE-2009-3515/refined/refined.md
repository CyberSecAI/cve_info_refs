Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability:** Multiple vulnerabilities in d.net CMS, including Local File Inclusion (LFI) and SQL Injection.

**Root Cause:**
*   **LFI:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `type` parameter when handling file paths, allowing an attacker to include local files.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `page`, `edit_id`, and `_p` parameters, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code into database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application is vulnerable to LFI through the `type` parameter in `dnet_admin/index.php`. By manipulating the `type` parameter, an attacker can include arbitrary files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQLi in `index.php` through the `page` parameter and in `dnet_admin/index.php` through `edit_id` and `_p` parameters. By injecting SQL code, an attacker can retrieve usernames and passwords from the database (specifically, the `cms_security_master` table).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **LFI:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, including configuration files, source code, and other sensitive data. This information could be used to further compromise the system or obtain access to credentials.
*   **SQLi:** An attacker can retrieve usernames and passwords, allowing them to potentially gain access to the application or the underlying system if those credentials are reused. They can also modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **LFI:** The attack vector is the `type` parameter in `dnet_admin/index.php`. By providing a crafted value containing path traversal sequences (`../../..`) and a target filename, an attacker can include local files.
*   **SQLi:** The attack vectors are the `page` parameter in `index.php` and the `edit_id` and `_p` parameters in `dnet_admin/index.php`. By injecting SQL code in these parameters, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **LFI:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `dnet_admin/index.php` page with the manipulated `type` parameter. Admin access is required to exploit this LFI.
*   **SQLi:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `index.php` and `dnet_admin/index.php` pages with manipulated `page`, `edit_id`, and `_p` parameters. Some SQL injection vectors can be exploited without any authentication, while others require admin privileges.

**Additional Details:**
* The exploit details provided in the content offer specific proof-of-concept (PoC) URLs demonstrating how to exploit these vulnerabilities.
* The SQL injection allows retrieval of usernames and passwords from the `cms_security_master` table.
