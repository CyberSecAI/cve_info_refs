Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-3619:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from ViewVC improperly handling and displaying illegal parameter names when printing error messages. This unsafe printing of parameter names allows for the injection of malicious content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Handling:** The software fails to adequately sanitize or filter parameter names before displaying them in error messages.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** While not directly stated as the vulnerability type, the description strongly implies an XSS vulnerability, as the unfiltered display of parameter names enables an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL with crafted parameter names that, when displayed, would execute malicious client-side scripts.
- **Potential for Information Disclosure:** An attacker might be able to use XSS to steal session cookies or redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Potential for Defacement/Malicious Actions:** An attacker might be able to alter content on the user's screen, perform actions on behalf of the user, or even install malicious browser extensions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes specially formatted parameter names. When ViewVC encounters this URL, it includes the unsafe parameter names in the error message.
- **Client-Side Script Injection:** By inserting HTML and JavaScript code into parameter names, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser when the error message is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious parameter names.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking the malicious URL, or to be on a network that the user connects to, such as with an XSS attack where it could be on an attacked page.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in ViewVC version 1.0.9.
- This CVE is closely related to CVE-2009-3618, which addresses a separate XSS issue in ViewVC.
- The vulnerability is present due to insufficient filtering of illegal characters, not specific to the type of illegal characters used.
