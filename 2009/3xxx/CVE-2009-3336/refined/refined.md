Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the `auction_details.php` script of PHP Pro Bid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker can't directly see the results of their queries, but can infer them based on the application's response.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `auction_id` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords from the `probid_admins` table, as demonstrated in the exploit code.
- **Potential for Full Database Compromise:** While the provided exploit targets usernames and passwords, the SQL injection vulnerability could be used to perform more extensive database operations, potentially leading to full database compromise and control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request targeting `auction_details.php` with a malicious `auction_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter (`auction_id`) and the path to the vulnerable script (`auction_details.php`).
- **Basic understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to understand blind SQL injection techniques to extract data.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The exploit script is written in Perl and demonstrates how to extract the username and password from the `probid_admins` table using a blind SQL injection technique.
- The exploit script systematically iterates through possible characters to reconstruct the desired data.
- The exploit uses `substring` and `char` SQL functions in conjunction with the `LIMIT` clause to extract the data character by character.
- The exploit code uses a regular expression to determine if the character is valid, and outputs the character.
- The exploit code provides the specific table and columns targeted by the exploit, `probid_admins` and `username` and `password` respectively.
