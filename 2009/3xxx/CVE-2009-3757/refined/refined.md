  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2009-3757",
      "root_cause": "The application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to poor validation of user-controlled inputs.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
        "SQL Injection",
         "Remote Command Execution"
      ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow attackers to perform a variety of malicious activities, including arbitrary script execution in the victim's browser, unauthorized password changes, VM hard stops, full database schema retrieval, and remote command execution on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating the username parameter in edituser.php and login.php",
         "Using crafted links to trigger CSRF attacks, for example to change a user's password or stop a virtual machine.",
        "Injecting malicious scripts via the location, sessionid, and vmname parameters in console.php and vmrefid/vmname parameters in forcerestart.php, forcesd.php",
        "Modifying config.ini.php via writeconfig.php to inject arbitrary PHP code."
      ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.",
        "Some vulnerabilities require the attacker to be able to trick a legitimate user into accessing malicious URLs."
      ],
      "additional_details": "The XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities are exploitable under the default PHP configuration (register_globals=Off and magic_quotes_gpc=On), while SQL injection and remote command execution require magic_quotes_gpc to be Off on the web server. The remote command execution is possible due to the insecure writeconfig.php, which can be abused to inject malicious PHP code into the config.ini.php file which is then executed by console.php."
