```
- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `historymonth` parameter in the `index.php` script. It also suffers from XSS vulnerabilities due to lack of input sanitization in the `index.php` script using various parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Blind SQL Injection
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Blind SQL Injection**: Allows an attacker to extract sensitive data from the database, potentially gaining unauthorized access to application data.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Blind SQL Injection**: By injecting SQL code into the `historymonth` parameter of the `index.php` script.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: By injecting malicious JavaScript into various parameters of the `index.php` script, such as `begin` or directly into the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
