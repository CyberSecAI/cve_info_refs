The provided content discusses multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities related to how browsers handle redirects, specifically focusing on the `refresh` and `location` headers, and `data:` and `javascript:` URIs.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The core issue is the browsers' failure to properly sanitize or block the execution of JavaScript within redirect headers when using `javascript:` or `data:` URIs.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **`refresh` Header XSS (Attack #1 & #2):** Browsers execute JavaScript code when a `refresh` header redirects to a `javascript:` or `data:` URI.
    *  **`location` Header XSS (Attack #3, #4, #5 & #6):** Browsers execute JavaScript code when a `location` header redirects to a `javascript:` or `data:` URI.
    *   **302 Redirect XSS (Attack #4 & #6):** Specific handling of 302 redirects combined with `javascript:` URIs causes the browser to display an "Object Moved" or "Found" page with a link that executes the injected JavaScript in the context of the original site after user interaction.
    *   **Maxthon Ultramode XSS (Attack #5):** Maxthon's Ultramode allows JavaScript execution via `javascript:` URI in `location` headers, even with 301 or 302 status codes.
    *   **301 and 303 redirect (Attack #7 & #8):** Similar to previous attacks, XSS is possible via data: and javascript: URI in redirectors using status 301 and 303.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Cookie Theft:**  XSS within the context of the site can be used to steal cookies, enabling session hijacking. (older browsers)
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code to redirect users to malicious sites or perform other actions.
    *   **Phishing:**  XSS can be used to inject content into the page, which is not in context of the site, and used for phishing attacks.
    *   **Social Engineering:** With the 302 redirect XSS, attackers can trick users into clicking on a link, which will execute malicious code.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Redirectors:** Exploiting server-side redirect scripts that use `refresh` or `location` headers.
    *   **URL Parameters:** Injecting malicious URIs into URL parameters that are then used in redirect headers.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    * Ability to inject malicious javascript or data URI into url parameters.
    * A vulnerable server-side script that uses user-provided input for the redirect.
    * The user must use a vulnerable browser.

**Vulnerable Browsers:**

*   **Mozilla 1.7.x and previous**
*   **Mozilla Firefox** (various versions, including 3.0.x, 3.5.x, 3.6.x and potentially others up to 15.0.1, with some fixes introduced in 9.0)
*   **Google Chrome** (various 1.x and 2.x versions, potentially later versions also)
*   **Opera** (versions 9.52, 10.00, 10.53 and potentially others)
*   **Safari** (4.0.3)
*   **SeaMonkey** (1.1.17)
*   **QtWeb** (3.0 Build 001 and 003)
*   **Maxthon** (3 Alpha with Ultramode)
*   **Orca Browser** (1.2 build 5)
