**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the server hosting simplePHPWeb.
- No Authentication: No valid credentials or specific user access level is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit is straightforward and doesn't require specific tools or techniques.
- The Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided as a simple URL: `http://127.0.0.1/[path]/admin/files.php`. The `[path]` needs to be replaced with the actual path of the application.
