Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3640:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `update_cr8_intercept()` function in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module could be triggered from userspace even when no APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) is present. This scenario leads to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference: The code attempts to access memory through a pointer that is NULL when there is no APIC, leading to a crash.
- Lack of proper checks: The code does not adequately validate the presence of an APIC before attempting to access its related data structures.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: Triggering this vulnerability will crash the kernel, leading to a denial-of-service condition on the host system.

**Attack vectors:**
- `kvm_vcpu_ioctl()`: The vulnerability can be triggered via the `kvm_vcpu_ioctl()` system call.
- User-accessible `/dev/kvm`: The attack requires the `/dev/kvm` device to be user-accessible which is a common configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user: The attacker needs to have access to a user account on the host machine with the ability to interact with the `/dev/kvm` device.
- No specific privileges beyond regular user access is mentioned for the exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in kernel version 2.6.32-rc1.
- The provided information is more detailed than the standard CVE description.
