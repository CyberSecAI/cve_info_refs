Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-3314:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `ladders.php` script of Elite Gaming Ladders v3.2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `platform` parameter within the `ladders.php` is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to:
    - Execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
    - Extract sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Potentially gain control of the server hosting the vulnerable application depending on database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to `ladders.php` with a specially crafted `platform` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable Elite Gaming Ladders application.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious queries.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit provided in the content uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject SQL commands via the `platform` parameter.
-  The provided example is: `http://eliteladders.com/demo/ladders.php?platform=-30+UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,@@version,5,6,7--`
- This demonstrates an attacker can retrieve database version information using this method.

**Additional Notes:**

- The exploit is specific to Elite Gaming Ladders v3.2.
- The vulnerability is present in the `ladders.php` file of the mentioned software.
- This information is more detailed than a standard CVE description and includes a proof of concept exploit.
