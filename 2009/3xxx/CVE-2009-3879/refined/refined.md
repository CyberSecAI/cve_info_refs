Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-3879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how `X11` and `Win32GraphicsDevice` handle the `getConfigurations()` method. Instead of returning a clone of the array of supported graphics configurations, the method returns the original array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Leak / Modification**: The core issue is that the array of supported graphics configurations is not cloned. This allows external code to:
    * Access the internal array directly.
    * Modify the supported configurations by altering the array's elements.
  
**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Modification of graphics configurations:** Attackers can modify the list of supported graphics configurations, which might lead to unexpected behavior of Java applications.
*   **Information Disclosure:** By accessing the array, an attacker might be able to gain information about the system's graphics capabilities. This could potentially be leveraged for more targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct access through the returned array:**  Any Java code that calls the `getConfigurations()` method of an `X11` or `Win32GraphicsDevice` object receives a direct reference to the internal array.  This is a vulnerability because it allows read and write access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to execute Java Code:** An attacker must be able to execute Java code within the same context as the vulnerable application that will call the `getConfigurations()` method. This could be via applets, web start applications, or other applications using the Java runtime.
*   **No special position is required**, the vulnerability is in how a method returns a reference to internal state.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry mentions that this vulnerability is related to OpenJDK and lists the specific bug ID 6822057 in the java bug database.
*   The Sun/Oracle release notes for Java 6u17 explicitly list bug ID `6822057` and describes it as "X11 and Win32GraphicsDevice don't clone arrays returned from getConfigurations()". This confirms the vulnerability description found in the Red Hat bugzilla entry and provides additional context.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200911-02) lists CVE-2009-3879 as part of a set of vulnerabilities in Sun JDK/JRE and describes the impact as potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and privilege escalation. While this GLSA includes CVE-2009-3879 it does not go into detail about this particular issue but it does provide broader context about a range of vulnerabilities patched around the same time.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `getConfigurations()` method in `X11` and `Win32GraphicsDevice` does not clone the array of graphics configurations it returns. This allows a malicious program to directly access and modify the list of supported graphics configurations, leading to unexpected application behavior or information disclosure.
