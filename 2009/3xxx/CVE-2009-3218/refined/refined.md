```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes a file from the 'addons' directory based on user-supplied input via the 'a' GET parameter without proper sanitization, leading to Local File Inclusion (LFI). Additionally, the authentication mechanism is vulnerable to SQL injection through the 'username' POST parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "SQL Injection (SQLi) for Authentication Bypass"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server via LFI. They can also bypass the authentication mechanism to gain administrative access via SQLi.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET request with manipulated 'a' parameter (LFI)",
    "HTTP POST request with malicious 'username' parameter (SQLi)"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
