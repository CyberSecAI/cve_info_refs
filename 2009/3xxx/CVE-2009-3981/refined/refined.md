  "CVE-2009-3981": {
    "description": "Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Jesse Ruderman reported a crash in the browser engine which only affected Firefox 3.",
