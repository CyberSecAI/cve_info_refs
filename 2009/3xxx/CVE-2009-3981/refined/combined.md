| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=546713#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-12-11 18:55:01 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Jesse Ruderman reported a crash in the browser engine which only affected Firefox 3.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=546713#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-16 05:04:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1674 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1674.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=546720#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-12-11 19:23:45 UTC  ``` Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of the IBM X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf of the user.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=546720#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-16 04:37:40 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1673 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1673.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=546720#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-16 05:04:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1674 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1674.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=546720#c3)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-18 04:31:33 UTC  ``` firefox-3.5.6-1.fc11, epiphany-extensions-2.26.1-9.fc11, yelp-2.26.0-10.fc11, ruby-gnome2-0.19.3-5.fc11, perl-Gtk2-MozEmbed-0.08-6.fc11.8, mozvoikko-0.9.7-0.10.rc1.fc11, monodevelop-2.0-8.fc11, Miro-2.5.2-7.fc11, kazehakase-0.5.8-4.fc11, google-gadgets-0.11.1-4.fc11, hulahop-0.4.9-11.fc11, gnome-web-photo-0.7-9.fc11, galeon-2.0.7-19.fc11, gnome-python2-extras-2.25.3-10.fc11, evolution-rss-0.1.4-9.fc11, blam-1.8.5-17.fc11, pcmanx-gtk2-0.3.8-11.fc11, epiphany-2.26.3-7.fc11, chmsee-1.0.1-14.fc11, xulrunner-1.9.1.6-1.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# USN-873-1: Firefox 3.0 and Xulrunner 1.9 vulnerabilities

18 December 2009

Firefox 3.0 and Xulrunner 1.9 vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [firefox-3.0](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.0) -
* [xulrunner-1.9](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9) -

## Details

Jesse Ruderman, Josh Soref, Martijn Wargers, Jose Angel, Olli Pettay, and

David James discovered several flaws in the browser and JavaScript engines

of Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a

remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2009-3979](/security/CVE-2009-3979), [CVE-2009-3981](/security/CVE-2009-3981), [CVE-2009-3986](/security/CVE-2009-3986))

Takehiro Takahashi discovered flaws in the NTLM implementation in Firefox.

If an NTLM authenticated user visited a malicious website, a remote

attacker could send requests to other applications, authenticated as the

user. ([CVE-2009-3983](/security/CVE-2009-3983))

Jonathan Morgan discovered that Firefox did not properly display SSL

indicators under certain circumstances. This could be used by an attacker

to spoof an encrypted page, such as in a phishing attack. ([CVE-2009-3984](/security/CVE-2009-3984))

Jordi Chancel discovered that Firefox did not properly display invalid URLs

for a blank page. If a user were tricked into accessing a malicious

website, an attacker could exploit this to spoof the location bar, such as

in a phishing attack. ([CVE-2009-3985](/security/CVE-2009-3985))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-65

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.1.6/ 1.9.0.16)

Announced
December 15, 2009
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.16
* Firefox 3.5.6
* SeaMonkey 2.0.1
* Thunderbird 3.0.1

### Description

Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed
several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of
memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with
enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.

### References

Jesse Ruderman, Josh Soref, Martijn Wargers, Jose Angel, and Olli
Pettay reported crashes in the browser engine which affected both
Firefox 3 and Firefox 3.5.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. (CVE-2009-3979, CVE-2009-3981, CVE-2009-3986)

A flaw was found in the Firefox NT Lan Manager (NTLM) authentication
protocol implementation. If an attacker could trick a local user that has
NTLM credentials into visiting a specially-crafted web page, they could
send arbitrary requests, authenticated with the user's NTLM credentials, to
other applications on the user's system. (CVE-2009-3983)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed the SSL location bar
indicator. An attacker could create an unencrypted web page that appears to
be encrypted, possibly tricking the user into believing they are visiting a
secure page. (CVE-2009-3984)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed blank pages after a user
navigates to an invalid address. If a user visits an attacker-controlled
web page that results in a blank page, the attacker could inject content
into that blank page, possibly tricking the user into believing they are
viewing a legitimate page. (CVE-2009-3985)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 3.0.16. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this errata.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 3.0.16, which corrects these issues. After installing the
update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=546713#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-12-11 18:55:01 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Jesse Ruderman reported a crash in the browser engine which only affected Firefox 3.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=546713#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-16 05:04:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1674 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1674.html>   ``` |  |

   Takehiro Takahashi discovered that the NTLM implementaion is vulnerable
   to reflection attacks.

CVE-2009-3981:

   Jesse Ruderman discovered a crash in the layout engine, which might allow
   the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3979:

   Jesse Ruderman, Josh Soref, Martijn Wargers, Jose Angel and Olli Pettay
   discovered crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution
   of arbitrary code.

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions

The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

###!!! ASSERTION: the pointer to this sibling will be overwritten: '!aNewFrame->GetNextSibling()', file /Users/jruderman/central/layout/generic/nsFrameList.cpp, line 176
###!!! ASSERTION: Some objects allocated with AllocateFrame were not freed: 'mFrameCount == 0', file /Users/jruderman/central/layout/base/nsPresShell.cpp, line 675
Likely exploitable. The testcase doesn't cause a crash, but a variant (created with the usual trick) makes Firefox dereference 0xdadadaf6.

The usual suspects, the block reflow reports incompleteness, the table starts to split, but as it is not in pagination mode, this goes wrong.

FWIW: I hit the assertions from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=468771#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: the pointer to this sibling will be overwritten\" with -moz-column, table") and [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=468771#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: the pointer to this sibling will be overwritten\" with -moz-column, table") on the first testcase, and the incomplete assert on the second testcase, using my linux mozilla-central debug build (updated yesterday).

FWIW, the testcase on [bug 435664](/show_bug.cgi?id=435664 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash after clicking 'Print This Page' on National Grid website (Firefox 3 RC1) [@ ReparentFrame(nsIFrame*, nsIFrame*, nsIFrame*)]") triggers this bug's assertion ("the pointer to this sibling will be overwritten") when printed / print-previewed. (It also crashes, which is what that bug is primarily about.) See [bug 435664 comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=435664#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash after clicking 'Print This Page' on National Grid website (Firefox 3 RC1) [@ ReparentFrame(nsIFrame*, nsIFrame*, nsIFrame*)]"). Possibly related to this bug?

I think the problem here is that the column set is propagating incompleteness that's ok inside of it to outside of it... although maybe incompleteness isn't ok inside the last column of a column set.

The comment should help explain what's going on.
Basically we're just changing the number of columns from 2 to 1. This should mean that the first column pulls all the content out of the second column, but that doesn't happen because we skip reflowing the first column. We need to tweak the incremental reflow test so that we always reflow the last column if we're giving it unbounded height; it will want to pull content from its next-sibling.
