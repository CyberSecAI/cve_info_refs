Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper input sanitization in the `cid` parameter of the Gyro V5.0 application, which is used in the `home?op=cat` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of the `cid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The same `cid` parameter is also vulnerable to XSS, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to steal sensitive information, modify data, or even gain control of the database server.
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that could steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vectors are through HTTP GET requests to the `home` page, specifically targeting the `op=cat` functionality and injecting malicious payloads into the `cid` parameter. Example: `http://localhost/home?op=cat&cid=[payload]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application to send HTTP requests.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL and JavaScript:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL for SQL injection attacks and JavaScript for XSS attacks.
- **No Authentication Required**: The exploitation does not require any prior authentication, since the vulnerabilities are in the public facing part of the application
