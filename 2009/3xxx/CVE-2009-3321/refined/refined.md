Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3321

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection. This occurs due to improper handling of user-supplied input within the `CLIENT_IP` header, allowing an attacker to inject SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application doesn't directly output the results of the SQL queries. Instead, the attacker needs to infer the results based on the timing of the server's response (delayed response based on the `BENCHMARK` function in MySQL).
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application fails to sanitize or validate the `CLIENT_IP` header, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by using the timing based blind SQL injection.  In the provided exploit, database usernames and password hashes are being extracted.
- Unauthorized Access: Gaining database credentials can be a means to escalate access to the underlying system.
- Further Exploitation: Extracted data can be used to perform further attacks on the system or application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Header Manipulation: The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious `CLIENT_IP` header in an HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- Understanding of Blind SQL Injection Techniques: The attacker needs to understand how to use timing to infer data from blind SQL injections, using functions like `BENCHMARK` to induce delays in response time.
- Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads: The attacker needs to craft precise SQL injection payloads that will extract data bit by bit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit provided in the content uses a Ruby script that automates the exploitation process, demonstrating the practical impact of the vulnerability.
- The script first determines the average response time, then uses timing-based queries with `BENCHMARK` to leak data from the database.
- The script extracts the username length, the username and the password hash.
- The exploit uses the `UNION SELECT IF(condition, BENCHMARK(delay, char(char(32))), 3434) #` structure within the `CLIENT_IP` header to induce delays if the condition is true and thus leak data.
