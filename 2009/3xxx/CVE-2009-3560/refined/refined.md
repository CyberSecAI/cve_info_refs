{
  "CVE-2009-3560": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer over-read in the `big2_toUtf8` function within the Expat XML parsing library when processing malformed UTF-8 sequences in an XML document.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer over-read",
      "Improper handling of malformed UTF-8 sequences"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash).",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a crafted XML document with specific malformed UTF-8 sequences that trigger the vulnerability.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide the malformed XML to a system or application that processes it via the vulnerable version of the expat library. This could be through a malicious website serving a manipulated XML document or having the user open a malformed XML file.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in the `DEFINE_UTF16_TO_UTF8` macro and the associated `E##toUtf8` function in the `xmltok.c` file of the Expat library. When parsing UTF-8 sequences, a loop increments a pointer by 2, while comparing it against an end limit. If the end limit is not aligned to a multiple of 2, the loop may continue beyond the intended boundary, causing the buffer over-read. The issue was found to affect several applications that rely on the vulnerable expat library, including python's xmlrpc, various components of the apache web server, and the CPAN module XML::Parser. The vulnerability was fixed by updating the parsing logic in `xmlparse.c` and `xmltok.c` of the Expat library to handle malformed UTF-8 sequences correctly. "
