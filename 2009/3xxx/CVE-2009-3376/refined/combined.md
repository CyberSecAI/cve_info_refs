How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- apache2-mod\_php5/php5
Incomplete XML RPC requests could crash the php interpreter (CVE-2010-0397).

- libmozhelper-1\_0-0/mozilla-xulrunner190
The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.1
- libopenssl-devel

- seamonkey
This update brings Mozilla Seamonkey to 1.1.19 fixing various bugs and
security issues.
Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

[dialog presented when downloading S[RLO]iva.exe on Mac](attachment.cgi?id=395411)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=395411&action=edit)

When downloading a file with the unicode RTL override character (RLO) in it ("S[RLO]iva.exe"), the file download dialog presents two different filenames: one in the title ("Sexe.avi") and one in the content of the dialog ("Savi.exe"). The RLO character is stripped for the Save dialog later presented.
This is inconsistent use of the RLO unicode character U+202E. Perhaps it should just be removed from any downloaded filename.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=395412&action=edit)

This is a text file with a filename containing RLO. It should display as Siva.exe when RLO is stripped out or ignored, and Sexe.avi when RLO is honored.

We should strip RLO (at least) from downloaded files, since Windows Explorer and Mac Finder both make it look like you have a .avi file (if you look at the extension rather than the "type").

CCing some bidi people who might have ideas about how common RLO is in real filenames, and whether there are any other characters we should strip from download filenames.

A generic solution would be removing all LRE, RLE, LRO, RLO, and PDF, as any of the first four characters may have bad effects (confusing looks or security issues) if the relevant PDF is missing. These characters are disallowed in IDNA (also IDNAbis) as well.

It's better to remove these from suggestedFileName, to prevent further problems with names like: "[RLO].txt".

RLO and the rest of these control characters are not at all common in real file names, so I second Behnam's suggestion of removing them altogether.
I have a patch which handles this in the helper app service, with a unit test.Assignee: nobody → ehsan.akhgariStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Jumping in with Jesse's suggestion. I wanted to add some other perspective if I could.
If you were to strip RLO from filenames, you'd clearly be risking data-loss, and may even open the software up to other attacks – e.g. attackers could now bypass other content filters, anti-virus etc. with files like: nasty[RLO].[RLO]e[RLO]x[RLO]e. Although from your diff it looks like you're proposing to replace the RLO with the \_ character.
Another idea would be to change the UI display in cases where the end user must make a security decision, such as a file download dialog box.
If you do go with the removing/replacing change, then you should also at theRLM and LRM to your list of unsafeBidiCharacters:
U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK
U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK

Yes, indeed removing those characters would be a mistake - we always replace invalid characters with '\_' (and so does this patch).

Hmm, why? RLM and LRM don't change the representation of strong LTR/RTL characters (for example, latin alphabets), do they? Do you have any example in which these characters can be used for spoofing?

(In reply to [comment #11](/show_bug.cgi?id=511521#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - downloading file with RTL override (RLO) presents conflicting filenames"))
I thought I had a test case for the LRM and RLM that produced files looking like "Sexe." but I can't find those cases and couldn't reproduce. You're right these wouldn't change strong LTR/RTL characters but the case of symbols and punctionation I thought was different.

Patch (v1)
Requesting additional review from smontagu for a sanity-check on this security change. (new super-review guidelines seem to call for sr= on all security bug fixes; I can count bz as the sr=).
Do all (web-sourced) files we write to disk go through this path? (e.g. what if there's no file picker but the user auto-saves the file)

I think it would probably be more solid to add the Bidi control characters to the macros at the end of xpcom/ds/nsCRT.h, as in the fix for [bug 393488](/show_bug.cgi?id=393488 "VERIFIED FIXED - Special characters in filename block the download function") ([attachment 313060](/attachment.cgi?id=313060 "Patch for checkin") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=313060&action=edit "Patch for checkin") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=313060&action=diff "Patch for checkin") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=393488&attachment=313060)).

That's the approach I tried first, but FILE\_ILLEGAL\_CHARACTERS is a narrow character string, and some of its consumers use it on narrow strings. I'm not sure how to add Unicode characters without breaking compatibility with existing callers.

Interesting. I tried this in the Seamonkley 1.1 nightly (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.24pre) Gecko/20100225 SeaMonkey/1.1.19pre). The naming issue seems to be fixed but Seamonkey 1.1 hangs as it does the download after you tell it where to save the file. I don't know if this is an unrelated issue.

Could you please attach a debugger and get a stack for the hang?

If the build does not come with symbols, then you probably need a debug build.

I don't QA Seamonkey and I am not set up to build 1.8.1 in any case so I don't have access to a debug build of it. I only used it to test because it was a 1.8.1 based build that had an easy browser built in.
Once we have our blocking Thunderbird issue (not this) fixed, I will check this bug in a TB build and hopefully verify it. If you wish to dig into the Seamoney side, perhaps Kairo can be of some help.

Anyone wanting to look into that further probably needs to do his own build, we don't build debug or symbols on my private machines that do SeaMonkey 1.x builds.
Also, we will announce the 1.8.1.24-based SeaMonkey 1.1.19 as EOL release that contains known flaws but should at least be better than 1.1.18 for those who can't switch to the 2.0.x series. In that light, I'm not sure how much time one wants to spend on that.
We'll see what Al's Thunderbird testing results in.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine of Thunderbird. If a

user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into viewing malicious web

content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-0689](/security/CVE-2009-0689), [CVE-2009-2463](/security/CVE-2009-2463), [CVE-2009-3075](/security/CVE-2009-3075))

Josh Soref discovered that the BinHex decoder used in Thunderbird contained

a flaw. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious content, a remote

attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-3072](/security/CVE-2009-3072))

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not properly manage memory when

using XUL tree elements. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious

content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-3077](/security/CVE-2009-3077))

Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm discovered that Thunderbird did not properly

display filenames containing right-to-left (RTL) override characters. If a

user were tricked into opening a malicious file with a crafted filename, an

attacker could exploit this to trick the user into opening a different file

than the user expected. ([CVE-2009-3376](/security/CVE-2009-3376))

Takehiro Takahashi discovered flaws in the NTLM implementation in

Thunderbird. If an NTLM authenticated user opened content containing links

to a malicious website, a remote attacker could send requests to other

applications, authenticated as the user. ([CVE-2009-3983](/security/CVE-2009-3983))

Ludovic Hirlimann discovered a flaw in the way Thunderbird indexed certain

messages with attachments. A remote attacker could send specially crafted

content and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0163](/security/CVE-2010-0163))

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-62

## Download filename spoofing with RTL override

Announced
October 27, 2009
Reporter
Jesse Ruderman, Sid Stamm
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.15
* Firefox 3.5.4
* SeaMonkey 2

### Description

Mozilla security researchers **Jesse Ruderman**
and **Sid Stamm** reported that when downloading a file
containing a right-to-left override character (RTL) in the filename,
the name displayed in the dialog title bar conflicts with the name of
the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of a file to be
downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an executable
file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
