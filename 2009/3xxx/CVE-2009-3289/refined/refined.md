Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-3289:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `g_file_copy` function within the glib library. When this function copies a symbolic link, it incorrectly attempts to also copy the file permissions of the symlink's target. This action is performed even when the `nofollow-symlinks` option is set, which is intended to prevent following symlinks during the copy operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Handling:** The core weakness is the flawed logic in `g_file_copy` that attempts to transfer permissions to the symlink target, despite the user's intention to copy the symlink itself.
*   **Unintended Modification:** The target of the symlink, which could be an important file or directory, is unintentionally modified to have 0777 permissions (read/write/execute for all users).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** If the symlink points to a sensitive file (e.g., `.ssh/id_rsa`), the 0777 permissions allow other users on the system to read or modify the file, compromising its confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Data Corruption:**  Unauthorised modification of files or directories due to the overly permissive permissions.
*   **Unexpected behavior:** In some cases, the unexpected permission change of symlink targets could cause issues with other applications. As noted in the reports, this also caused some regression bugs in other parts of the system, such as preventing dragging shortcuts to the desktop or crashing nautilus.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Copying:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user copies a symlink using affected applications (e.g., Nautilus file manager in GNOME).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create and copy symlinks.
*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability, as the permission changes are possible for a user.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The bug was initially reported in the context of the Nautilus file manager but was determined to be a flaw within the underlying glib library.
*   The vulnerability is not a privilege escalation issue, as it only allows a user to set permissions that they would otherwise be able to set using `chmod`.
*   The fix involved modifying the glib library to not attempt to set permissions on symlink targets when copying with `nofollow-symlinks`.
*   The fix was applied across multiple Ubuntu versions (Hardy, Intrepid, Jaunty, Karmic) and potentially other distributions.
*   The bug was also reported and fixed in the upstream GNOME project.

In summary, CVE-2009-3289 is a vulnerability where copying a symlink can unintentionally alter the permissions of the symlink's target to 0777 due to a flawed file copy function in glib. This could lead to sensitive data exposure, unauthorized modification, and potential application malfunction.
