How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request - glib symlink copying permission exposure

Hi,

I'd like to request a CVE for an issue where glib causes symlink targets
to gain 0777 permissions when any symlink pointing at the target is
copied.  There is no privilege escalation, but it can lead to situations
where other users on a system could have read/write access to important
files (e.g. .ssh/id_rsa).

<https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/418135>
<http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=593406>

Thanks,

-Kees

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: nautilus

TEST CASE:

1. Create a symlink to a file or folder, on which you normally are able change permissions. (touch ~/testfile && ln -s ~/testfile ~/testlink)

2. Copy the symlink to anywhere using Nautilus (ctrl+c && ctrl+v)

3. Check permissions of the symlinked file or folder

Result: Symlinked file or folder permissions are changed to 777 (drwxrwxrwx user:user)

Expected behaviour: Permissions of symlinked file folder should be unchanged

NOTE: If testing different versions, nautilus needs to be restarted (including desktop), this easily done with:

killall nautilus && nautilus &disown

This bug does not allow setting permissions which your user could not do with chmod anyway, and hence is not a privilege escalation issue.

Confirmed in Karmic on 'first' laptop (mentioned above).

Apparently 777 permissions are also set on the subfolders: Desktop, Music, Pictures and Videos (in this specific case?)

This seems to be dependend on symlinks. On a new user this does not occur. However, if I create a symlink in the user directory pointing to /home/user the issue appears.

This wast most likely the cause for the earlier occurances also, since wine creates symlinks in ~/.wine/drive\_c/windows/profiles/user/ to /home/user as wells as to Desktop, Music, Pictures and Videos in ~

Cheers Pedro, I'm in the works of hopefully narrowing the bug down a bit, so some updating in the upstream description might be required when done.

Even further testing done:

Only thing needed to reproduce is a symlink to a directory your user are able to change permissions of.

If this symlink is copied by nautilus, to anywhere, the symlinked directory will get it's permissions set to 777.

This can cause really nasty side-effects for people using symlinks into their encrypted Private directory. This needs to be fixed for Karmic and SRU'd to Jaunty.

This bug has been fixed upstream using what seems like a completely different method, we might have to consider whether we want that or current karmic solution.

Getting the fix into hardy may be non-trivial, since the patch seems to depend on the function g\_set\_error\_literal, which is, i assume, not implemented in pre-intrepid glib (attached build errors for hardy).

This function is implemented here:

This function is implemented here:

  (5.1 KiB,
  text/plain)

I've edited the patch to use g\_set\_error instead of g\_set\_error\_literal (simply replacing the function since the arguments seems to already be in the right format).

Since I have minimal knowledge about the actual code involved in this I can only confirm that it works with no immediate regressions on an i386 virtualbox instance.

Yet another debdiff attached, and testing packages available in my ppa.

I just tested this on a VBox Dapper, seems like the issue is nonexistant there.

Invalidating for now.

These are building in the security queue now; thanks for all the work in testing and building! I adjusted the changelogs to use the -security pocket, but other than that, it looks great. Once they're built, I'll get them tested again and published.

As chmod affects the symlink target, this would cause such copies to always set the target to 777 mode.  This patch makes setting the mode with nofollow-symlinks fail with NOT_SUPPORTED.  The aforementioned g_file_copy() will still succeed, because it ignores errors of the attribute copy. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=593406#c6)  Benjamin Otte (Company)    2009-09-01 10:33:17 UTC  ``` pushed the fix to git after getting an ok from Alex. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=593406#c7)  Dan Winship    2009-09-01 12:41:17 UTC  ``` This breaks gio/tests/live-g-file:  danw@desktop:tests (master)> ./live-g-file  /live-g-file/prep_clean_structure:    Cleaning target testing structure in 'testdir_live-g-file'...     deleting 'dir1'     deleting 'subdir'     deleting 'dir2'     deleting 'dir-target'     deleting 'dir_no-access' OK /live-g-file/create_structure:    Going to create testing structure in 'testdir_live-g-file'...

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- krb5
Specially crafted requests be authenticated remote attackers could
crash the KDC (CVE-2010-1320).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- clamav
Specially crafted CAB archives could crash clamav (CVE-2010-1311) or
bypass virus detection (CVE-2010-0098). clamav has been updated to
version 0.96 which fixes those issues.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- systemtap
Remote attackers could execute arbitrary commands by including shell
meta characters in commands to the stap server (CVE-2009-4273).
Commands with a long arguments list could cause a buffer overflow
and crash the system if a script tried to retrieve the argument list
(CVE-2010-0411).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- apache2
When using a multithreaded MPM apache could leak memory of requests
handled by a different thread when processing subrequests
(CVE-2010-0434).
Specially crafted requests could crash mod\_proxy\_ajp (CVE-2010-0408).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- glib2
The when copying symbolic links the g\_file\_copy function set the
target of the link to mode 0777 therefore exposing potentially
sensitive information or allowing other user to modify files they
should not have access to (CVE-2009-3289).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- mediawiki
MediaWiki was prone to a CSS validation flaw and data leakage
vulnerability (CVE-2010-1189, CVE-2010-1190).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- apache
Specially crafted requests could lead to an integer overflow in
mod\_proxy. Attackers could exploit that to crash apache or
potentially cause execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2010-0010).
The problem only affects 64bit architectures.
Affected Products: SLES9

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
