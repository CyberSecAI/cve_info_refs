Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-3985:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles invalid URLs when setting `document.location` on a web page that results in a blank page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **URL Spoofing:** A web page can set `document.location` to an invalid URL, which results in the browser displaying a blank page.
*   **Content Injection:** After the browser displays the blank page due to the invalid URL, the attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript into the body of that blank page. This can be achieved through the use of the `document.write` method.
*   **Inadequate Error Handling**: The browser doesn't properly handle the transition to an error page, allowing a malicious script to inject content before the error page fully loads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Spoofing:** An attacker could make the browser's address bar display a legitimate-looking but invalid URL.
*   **Phishing:** This spoofed address bar, coupled with attacker-injected content, could be used for phishing attacks. Users might be tricked into thinking they are on a legitimate page, causing them to divulge sensitive information.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Though not directly stated in the description of the CVE, the injected Javascript has the potential to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Tricking Users:** Users must be tricked into visiting the malicious website. This can be achieved through links in emails, social media, or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to host a website accessible over the internet.
*   **JavaScript Skills:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript to craft a malicious webpage and perform content injection.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into accessing the malicious website.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerability occurs when a page uses javascript to set `document.location` to an invalid address which causes the browser to attempt to load an error page, and then use `window.stop` to halt the loading of the error page.  This causes the browser's address bar to still show the invalid URL that was used to generate the error page but renders a blank page which can then be modified with the `document.write` function.

The fixes involve delaying the current URI assignment and history entry creation and preventing stop of the error page load if not called from chrome or system.
