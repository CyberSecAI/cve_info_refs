Subject: default response to libpam-runtime configuration disables unix passwords
Date: 16 Mar 2009 01:53:23 -0700
```

Package: libpam-runtime
Version: 1.0.1-7
Severity: critical

On some Debian unstable systems, configuring libpam-runtime leads to
the following question:

  # dpkg-reconfigure libpam-runtime
  Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) determine how authentication,
  authorization, and password changing are handled on the system, as well as
  allowing configuration of additional actions to take when starting user
  sessions.

  Some PAM module packages provide profiles that can be used to automatically
  adjust the behavior of all PAM-using applications on the system.  Please
  indicate which of these behaviors you wish to enable.

    1. Unix authentication  2. none of the above

  (Enter the items you want to select, separated by spaces.)

  PAM profiles to enable:

Pressing enter (with an empty default) results in Unix password
authentication being turned off.  This is unexpected and not very nice
behavior.  I have labelled severity as critical as it had the effect
of leaving a system accessible remotely without password for several
days, during which typical ssh robo-scans were able to log in freely
and trivially gain root.

I can confirm this problem. I've set a cron job to update the system everyday
and got this from /var/log/apt/term.log:
	Setting up libpam-runtime (1.0.1-7) ...
	debconf: unable to initialize frontend: Dialog
	debconf: (TERM is not set, so the dialog frontend is not usable.)
	debconf: falling back to frontend: Readline
	Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) determine how authentication, authorization, and password changing are handled on the system, as well as allowing configuration of additional actions to take when starting user sessions.

	Some PAM module packages provide profiles that can be used to automatically adjust the behavior of all PAM-using applications on the system.  Please indicate which of these behaviors you wish to enable.

	  1. Unix authentication  2. none of the above

	(Enter the items you want to select, separated by spaces.)

	PAM profiles to enable:
	Use of uninitialized value $_[1] in join or string at /usr/share/perl5/Debconf/DbDriver/Stack.pm line 104.
	(Reading database ... 313074 files and directories currently installed.)
	Preparing to replace libpam0g 1.0.1-5 (using .../libpam0g_1.0.1-7_i386.deb) ...
	Unpacking replacement libpam0g ...

but ssh doesn't appear to be affected by this, still asks for a password.

This happens only if:

- You set the debconf priority to medium or lower.
- You are using the readline frontend instead of the default dialog
  frontend.
- You do not have libterm-readline-gnu-perl installed.

To the extent that debconf doesn't inform you what the currently-selected
options are, that should probably be considered a debconf bug.  However,
with these settings you're going to get a lot of wrong "defaults" if you're
just hitting enter, and that's effectively user error for configuring
debconf that way and subsequently hitting enter...

No, it's not very nice.  There are three possible courses of action here in
the case that the user selects an empty set of modules.  We can have a
default permit policy (fail open), a default deny policy (fail closed), or
we can force the user to choose one or more modules.

I had avoided going with the last option because it requires additional
debconf prompts that will require another round of translation; but if it's
not sufficiently obvious that it's an error to answer this question with an
empty set of modules, then that's what we'll need to do.

Mmm, then your cronjob is broken.  You shouldn't auto-install packages from
a cronjob without first configuring debconf to use the noninteractive
frontend for this purpose; you will run into other problems besides this
one.

It asks for a password, but I believe you'll find that it accepts any
value.  You'll want to run 'pam-auth-update' as root to fix up your
authentication config immediately, if you haven't already done so.

I remember checking this with blank password and other random typed passwords
and it didn't work.
And yes, I ran pam-auth-update as soon I found what was going on.

 mechanism for PAM did not safely handle an empty selection. If an
 administrator had specifically removed the default list of modules or
 failed to chose a module when operating debconf in a very unlikely
 non-default configuration, PAM would allow any authentication attempt,
 which could lead to remote attackers gaining access to a system with
 arbitrary privileges. This did not affect default Ubuntu installations.

Also tracked as:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519927>
<https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/410171>

This was a Debian and Ubuntu specific issue, and only Ubuntu had supported
releases with this flaw present (the issue never made it to Debian
stable).

Thanks,

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

If:

- You set the debconf priority to medium or lower.

- You are using the readline frontend instead of the default dialog or GNOME frontend.

- You do not have libterm-readline-gnu-perl installed.

then pam-auth-update will by default enable \*no\* profiles, resulting in an insecure system that lets anyone in as any user, with or without a password.

The fix for this is pending in bzr for Debian unstable and karmic.

This bug was fixed in the package pam - 1.0.1-10ubuntu1

---------------

pam (1.0.1-10ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

\* Merge from Debian, remaining changes:

    - debian/libpam-modules.postinst: Add PATH to /etc/environment if it's not

      present there or in /etc/security/pam\_env.conf. (should send to Debian).

    - debian/libpam0g.postinst: only ask questions during update-manager when

      there are non-default services running.

    - debian/patches-applied/series: Ubuntu patches are as below ...

    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-fix\_standard\_types: Use standard u\_int8\_t

      type rather than \_\_u8.

    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-no-error-if-missingok: add a new, magic

      module option 'missingok' which will suppress logging of errors by

      libpam if the module is not found.

    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-regression\_fix\_securetty: prompt for

      password on bad username.

    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-rlimit\_nice\_correction: Explicitly

      initialise RLIMIT\_NICE rather than relying on the kernel limits.

    - debian/patches-applied/ubuntu-user\_defined\_environment: Look at

      ~/.pam\_environment too, with the same format as

      /etc/security/pam\_env.conf. (Originally patch 100; converted to quilt.)

    - Change Vcs-Bzr to point at the Ubuntu branch.

    - debian/local/common-password, debian/pam-configs/unix: switch from

      "md5" to "sha512" as password crypt default.

    - Make libpam-modules depend on base-files (>= 5.0.0ubuntu6), to ensure

      run-parts does the right thing in /etc/update-motd.d.

    - debian/patches-applied/pam\_motd-legal-notice: display the contents of

      /etc/legal once, then set a flag in the user's homedir to prevent showing

      it again.

pam (1.0.1-10) unstable; urgency=high

[ Kees Cook ]

  \* Add debian/patches/pam\_1.0.4\_mindays: backport upstream 1.0.4 fixes
