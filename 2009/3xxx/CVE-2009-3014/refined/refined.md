The provided content describes multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that can be exploited through redirectors in various web browsers. Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in how different web browsers handle redirects, specifically when the redirect URL is a `javascript:` URI or a `data:` URI. The browsers fail to properly sanitize or restrict the execution context of the code contained in these URIs, leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The weaknesses are in the browser's handling of redirects via `Location` and `Refresh` headers, particularly with `javascript:` and `data:` URIs.

Specifically:

*   **Refresh Header XSS (Attack #1, #2):** Browsers such as older versions of Mozilla, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, Chrome, QtWeb and Safari were vulnerable to XSS by using a `Refresh` header that redirects to a `javascript:` URI or `data:` URI.
*   **Location Header XSS (Attack #3, #4, #5, #6):** Browsers such as older versions of Firefox and Opera were vulnerable to XSS by using a `Location` header that redirects to a `data:` URI. Additionally, older versions of Mozilla and Firefox and Maxthon with Ultramode were vulnerable to XSS via a `Location` header redirect to `javascript:` URI, particularly when the server returned a "302 Object Moved" or other 3xx status code.
*   **Bypass of Anti-Phishing/Malware Filters:** The use of `data:` URIs for malicious redirects allows attackers to bypass filters that rely on blacklisting URLs, as data URIs are not traditional HTTP addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Stealing:**  In some cases, the JavaScript code executes in the context of the vulnerable website, allowing an attacker to steal cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable website or in the browser. This can be used to perform various malicious actions, such as:
    *   **Phishing attacks:** Redirecting users to fake login pages or other malicious content.
    *   **Malware Distribution:**  Executing code that downloads or executes malicious software.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking users into performing actions that benefit the attacker (Strictly social XSS).
*   **Bypass of Security Measures**: Using data: URIs to bypass anti-phishing and anti-malware filters that rely on URL blacklists.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Redirectors:** The primary attack vector involves exploiting redirector scripts on web servers. These scripts, which use either `Location` or `Refresh` headers, can be manipulated to redirect users to malicious URIs.
*   **Manipulated URLs:** Attackers craft URLs with malicious `javascript:` or `data:` URIs, which are then processed by the redirector script.
*   **Redirection Services:** Vulnerabilities can be exploited through redirection services (e.g., tinyurl.com) by setting the malicious code instead of redirection address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** Attackers need to be able to create URLs that, when processed by a vulnerable redirector script, will generate responses with malicious `Location` or `Refresh` headers.
*   **Access to a Vulnerable Web Server or Redirection Service:**  Attackers must be able to either target a website with vulnerable redirector scripts or use a vulnerable redirection service.
*   **Social Engineering (for some attack vectors):** For attacks that rely on the "Object Moved" or "Unable to connect to site" pages, the attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a link on these pages, making it a Strictly social XSS attack

**Vulnerable Browsers (as mentioned in the article):**

*   Mozilla 1.7.x and older
*   Mozilla Firefox 3.0.x, 3.5.x, 3.6.x, 3.7 a1 pre, 4.0b2 and potentially others
*   Internet Explorer 6 and older (but not IE7 and IE8)
*   Opera 9.52, 10.00 Beta 3 Build 1699, 10.53, 10.62
*   Google Chrome 1.0.154.48, 2.0.172.28, 2.0.172.37, 3.0.193.2 Beta
*   QtWeb 3.0 Build 001 and 3.0 Build 003
*   Safari 4.0.3
*   SeaMonkey 1.1.17
*   Orca Browser 1.2 build 5
*   Maxthon 3 Alpha (3.0.0.145 and 3.0.2.2) with Ultramode
