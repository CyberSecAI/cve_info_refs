Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-3595:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **SQL injection vulnerability** present in the `results.php` file of VS PANEL version 7.5.5.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `Cat_ID` parameter in the `results.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection. This means that an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into this parameter, which will then be executed by the database server.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data from the database. The example provided shows how an attacker can extract usernames and passwords from the `Users` table.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Successful exploitation could potentially lead to a complete compromise of the application and the underlying server depending on the database user permissions.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `results.php` file.
*   **Manipulated URL Parameter:** The `Cat_ID` parameter within the URL is manipulated to inject SQL code.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious queries.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication, so no login credentials are needed for the attack to work.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit URL is: `www.vspanel.gr/results.php?Cat_ID=-6+union+select+1,concat(username,0x3a,password),3,4+from+Users--`
*   This URL injects a SQL `UNION` query to select the `username` and `password` fields from the `Users` table, demonstrating how to extract sensitive data.

**Summary:**

The CVE-2009-3595 vulnerability is an SQL injection vulnerability within VS PANEL 7.5.5 that allows an unauthenticated attacker to extract database content by manipulating the `Cat_ID` parameter in the `results.php` page.
