Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-3716:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Software:** mcshoutbox 1.1
*   **Root Cause:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Improperly sanitized user input in `scr_login.php` allows for manipulation of the SQL query, leading to authentication bypass.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Unescaped output of the `$loginerror` variable in `admin_login.php` allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
    *   **Shell Upload:** Lack of file extension validation in `admin.php` during smilie upload permits the uploading of malicious PHP files.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the usage of unsanitized user-supplied data in the SQL query. Specifically, the login functionality in  `scr_login.php` is vulnerable.
        ```php
         $query = "SELECT * FROM admin_tbl WHERE admin_name = ''or''='' AND
         admin_password = ''or''=''" ;
        ```
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS via the `loginerror` parameter in `admin_login.php`.
        ```php
        if(isset($loginerror)){ ?>
            <tr>
            <td colspan="2" align="center" style="font-size:18px;
            color:#FFFFFF;" ><?echo $loginerror?></td>
        ```
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows uploading arbitrary files via the smilie upload functionality in `admin.php` since file extensions are not checked.
        ```php
         if(isset($_POST['addsmilie'])){
                 $alt = $_POST['symbol'];
                $symbol = $_POST['symbol'];
                $img = $_FILES['image']['name'];
         ...
        $uploadfile = $uploaddir . $_FILES['image']['name'];
         ...
        $upload = move_uploaded_file($_FILES['image']['tmp_name'], $uploadfile);
        ```

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to bypass the admin login and gain unauthorized access to the application's administrative interface.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Enables an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Shell Upload:**  Enables an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, resulting in complete compromise of the server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Through a crafted login attempt using the username and password fields. Specifically, using `'or''='` for both username and password.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `loginerror` URL parameter.
    *   **Shell Upload:**  By submitting a crafted request to the `admin.php` page with a malicious PHP file as the smilie image.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **SQL Injection & XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the application and have a web browser.
    *   **Shell Upload:** The attacker needs access to the admin panel. This may be gained through the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry also references CVE-2009-3714 and CVE-2009-3715.
*   The SQL injection vulnerability requires `magic_quotes_gpc` to be off.
*   The file upload vulnerability does not check file extensions allowing for arbitrary file uploads.
