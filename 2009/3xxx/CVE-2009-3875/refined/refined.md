      "Stack-based buffer overflow in HsbParser.getSoundBank, setDiffICM functions",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow in setBytePixels, JPEGImageReader, and JPEG Image Writer",
      "Timing attack vulnerabilities in MessageDigest.isEqual",

    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application by enticing a user to open a specially crafted JAR archive, applet, or Java Web Start application. Attackers could cause a denial of service, disclose information and memory contents, write or execute local files, conduct session hijacking attacks via GIFAR files, steal cookies, bypass the same-origin policy, load untrusted JAR files, establish network connections to arbitrary hosts and posts, modify supported graphics configurations, bypass HMAC-based authentication systems, escalate privileges, and cause applet code to be executed with older, vulnerable JRE versions. Some vulnerabilities require user interaction, a DNS Man-in-the-Middle, or Cross-Site-Scripting attack.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted JAR archives",
      "Malicious Java applets on web pages",

      "Crafted image files (JPEG, BMP)",
      "Arguments to vulnerable functions (e.g., AWT)",
      "Malformed DER encoded data"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious JAR archive, applet, or Java Web Start application. For some attacks, user interaction, a DNS man-in-the-middle, or cross-site scripting is needed. Exploitation often involves crafted files or arguments to vulnerable functions.",
