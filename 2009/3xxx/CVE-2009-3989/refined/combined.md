## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

This is actually a trivial security problem. We should block access to the CVS/Root, CVS/Repository, and CVS/Entries files.
It is almost silly to mark this as a security bug, but it should be very easy to take care of.

I agree that we should fix this, but I'm not sure what the security implications are. After all, the software is open source; anyone can find out the filenames we use and the location of the CVS respoitory.

I can think of one, although it's not much. The Entries file contains the revision numbers for every file in the directory. If you are somehow blocked from determining which version of Bugzilla is in use, you could use this to find out.

This could also be used to find out if there's a revision of some file in use at a site that has a known security hole. Although, why not just try to exploit the hole directly without checking file revisions first..

What about if somebody checks their copy from their local repository? I don't think that even if this is the case a CVS repository password won't be revealed.Assignee: general â†’ wicked

Attached patch

[Fix permission and access right code in checksetup, V1](attachment.cgi?id=205438&action=diff) (obsolete)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=205438&action=edit)
â€” [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=314871&attachment=205438)

Here's my first attempt to protect CVS directories. This patch modifies checeksetup.pl to:
1) Add a deny rule for Root, Repository and Entries files to the generated top level .htaccess file (stops also subdirectories).
2) Generate deny all .htaccess file also to contrib, t and docs subdirectories (and simplifies same generating code for $attachdir, Bugzilla and $templatedir subdirectories).
3) Always deny Apache's access to any and all CVS directories that are encountered in the fixPerms() sub. Previously non-directory recursing calls to that sub ignored CVS. This left top level CVS directory accessible.
4) Change owners and permissions of contrib, t and docs subdirectories just like any other (note that new .htaccess they have).
Note that this diff has been done over the approved patch in [bug 319241](/show_bug.cgi?id=319241 "RESOLVED FIXED - Bugzilla.pm is freely accessible from the web"), which I assume is committed soonish.

As a security bug, I think this needs to be fixed on all branches. Skins subdirectory isn't affected because I think everything should be retrievable from there anyhow. But t, contrib and docs subdirectories are affected. Especially contrib is frightening because it can contain some nasty scripts..Status: NEW â†’ ASSIGNEDFlags: blocking2.22?Flags: blocking2.20.2?Flags: blocking2.18.5?Flags: blocking2.16.11?Summary: Web browsers can see CVS directory files â†’ Web browsers can see CVS, contrib, t and docs directory filesTarget Milestone: --- â†’ Bugzilla 2.16

I don't see any actual security implications for the 2.18 or 2.16 branches -- finding out what version of Bugzilla is in use is not a security issue, particularly.
However, 2.20 and 2.22 have bzdbcopy.pl in the contrib/ directory, which can contain a DB password.Flags: blocking2.22?Flags: blocking2.22+Flags: blocking2.20.2?Flags: blocking2.20.2+Flags: blocking2.18.5?Flags: blocking2.18.5-Flags: blocking2.16.11?Flags: blocking2.16.11-Target Milestone: Bugzilla 2.16 â†’ Bugzilla 2.20

Nit: I think we shouldn't prevent the access to docs/ from the web. If I were customising my installation, I would probably point my customers to my local docs/ instead of bugzilla.org. My vote to fix this on checkin.

Could someone explain me why globals.pl is world readable?? (question unrelated to this patch)
Tested on tip (doesn't apply cleanly on 2.20); looks good. And it's a nice cleanup too. r=LpSolit

â€” [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=314871&attachment=208194)

Backport to 2.20 branch with two changes. Firstly fixes adding localconfig.js and localconfig.rdf allow clauses (won't be duplicated anymore) and secondly access to docs subdirectory is no longer denied.

Fix permission and access right code in checksetup, V1
I hate to r- for this, but this isn't a blocker of our next release... I really think that we need to do that "removable block" thing for the .htaccess.
That is, we're finding that we need to modify the .htaccess from time to time, and I think that we just need to create a block inside some comments that says "do not remove or modify anything in this block."
In order to create that block, what we can do is check whether or not the .htaccess has that block in it. If it doesn't have the block, move the old .htaccess out of the way and replace it with a valid one. Make sure that you print a very obvious warning to the sysadmin that you've done this.
From then on out, we can easily modify the .htaccess.

I don't see how this would simplify the problem. If an admin edit the "do not touch" section anyway, checksetup.pl would be unable to fix it.

checksetup should replace the "do not touch" section every time it runs.

And if the admin, being a human being that is smarter than our perl script, happens to want to customize the "do not touch" section somehow, they would find this feature useful how?

They can still customize the .htaccess, they just do it below the section.

I still see no reason to deny review based on this. We could as well do it separately, in another bug.
Moreover, how do you expect to include your "do not touch" part for existing (customised) .htaccess? You would have to write an even bigger hack to extract the meaningful parts, both the "official" one set up by checksetup.pl and the customised one.

Okay, I'm fine with not having the "do not touch" block. But won't this patch fail anyhow if somebody has modified our parts of the .htaccess?

If they remove the section denying CVS access, then it will be added back when checksetup is run. This same problem happens with all the other .htaccess manipulations. Also our own manipulations introduce bugs in the .htaccess files (duplicated entries). :(
In the long run, somekind of "do not touch" block should probably be developed. Maybe for all generated .htaccess files? Could that be fixed in separate bug so this security bug could be fixed now?

Okay, so we were still exposing the contrib/ directory to the world, which can be a big problem, because bzdbcopy.pl can have passwords in it. However, I can't seem to access bzdbcopy.pl on any Bugzilla that I've configured, so I assume that somehow we're blocking it already. Other files in contrib/ are accessible, though, and probably shouldn't be.
This sets Unix permissions correctly on the contrib/ directory.
The only question remaining is--should we also be putting a .htaccess in all of these directories? I think we probably should be, because that protects Windows as well.Assignee: general â†’ mkanat

Ahh...because recurse\_dirs was not calling glob() on its keys. Will fix in the next patch. That's probably worth backporting at least to 3.2 even if the rest of the patch doesn't turn out to be worth backporting.

Maybe, but you still cannot access t/ from your web browser, so this is not an issue.

No, that's only true on \*nix. checksetup doesn't set permissions on Windows.

|  | |

When a parameter becomes obsolete, checksetup.pl automatically moves it into old-params.txt. If you have an old enough installation, or if you have customized your installation with your own parameters and some of these parameters are no longer in use, they will become publicly accessible from the web as .htaccess doesn't protect old-params.txt. This may be a problem if some parameters contain sensitive data (such as passwords), e.g. smtp\_password and smtp\_username (assuming they become obsolete one day).
.htaccess needs to be updated to protect old-params.txt.

Bugzilla 3.2 is restricted to security bugs only. Moreover, this bug is either assigned to nobody or got no traction for several months now. Rather than retargetting it at each new release, I'm clearing the target milestone and the bug will be retargetted to some sensible release when someone starts fixing this bug for real (Bugzilla 3.8 more likely).Target Milestone: Bugzilla 3.2 â†’ ---

patch - v1 (tip)
I just checked in \_rename\_file, so you can use that instead, and it should probably be in Bugzilla/Install/FileSystem if possible. Look at how we do it for data/mailer.testfile on 3.4 tip and trunk.

Also, what security implications does this have? Has there ever been a parameter moved into that file that would contain confidential information?

Not yet, which is why I didn't restrict the bug to the security group when I reported it last year. IMO, it's rather a "good to fix" bug than a real security one.

[Bug 314871](/show_bug.cgi?id=314871 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Web browsers can see CVS/, contrib/, docs/, and t/ directory files") is considered a security issue, and it's even more trivial than this bug, so I definitely think this should be considered a security issue.

I'm really of the opinion that this is not a security bug. Is there any research that shows that this could possibly actually expose something security-related from Bugzilla's history of parameters? As far as [bug 314871](/show_bug.cgi?id=314871 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Web browsers can see CVS/, contrib/, docs/, and t/ directory files"), there is a possible security issue with it, as listed in the comments of that bug.Flags: approval?Flags: approval3.4?Target Milestone: Bugzilla 3.0 â†’ Bugzilla 3.4

Several of the parameters removed over the years have been free-form text fields. There's no way for us to know if such fields contain private/confidential information, and if they do, such information would be leaked via old-params.txt even if the Bugzilla instance itself is locked down in other ways. So, yes, this is an information leak security bug.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
