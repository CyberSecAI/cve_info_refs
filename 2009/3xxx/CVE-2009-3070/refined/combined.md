How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : xulrunner
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-3070 CVE-2009-3071 CVE-2009-3072 CVE-2009-3074 CVE-2009-3075 CVE-2009-3076 CVE-2009-3077 CVE-2009-3078

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications, such as the Iceweasel web
browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-3070

    Jesse Ruderman discovered crashes in the layout engine, which
    might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3071

    Daniel Holbert, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay and "toshi" discovered
    crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3072

    Josh Soref, Jesse Ruderman and Martin Wargers discovered crashes
    in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary
    code.

CVE-2009-3074

    Jesse Ruderman discovered a crash in the Javascript engine, which
    might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3075

    Carsten Book and "Taral" discovered crashes in the layout engine,
    which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3076

    Jesse Ruderman discovered that the user interface for installing/
    removing PCKS #11 securiy modules wasn't informative enough, which
    might allow social engineering attacks.

CVE-2009-3077

    It was discovered that incorrect pointer handling in the XUL parser
    could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3078

    Juan Pablo Lopez Yacubian discovered that incorrent rendering of
    some Unicode font characters could lead to spoofing attacks on
    the location bar.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.9.0.14-0lenny1.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.14-1.

For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.1.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner package.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-47

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.1.3/ 1.9.0.14)

Announced
September 9, 2009
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.14
* Firefox 3.5.3

### Description

Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed
several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of
memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with
enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.

### References

this asserts now at
###!!! ASSERTION: We placed a float where there was no room!: 'psd->mX - mTrimmableWidth <= psd->mRightEdge', file d:/moz\_src/src/layout/generic/nsLineLayout.cpp, line 345
The assert was first added as
NS\_ASSERTION(psd->mX <= psd->mRightEdge,"We placed a float where there was no room!");
with the patch from [bug 50630](/show_bug.cgi?id=50630 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FLOAT] float should be as high as previous line box") (patches without a bug# in the comment are fun, but you can run but you can not hide ;-) )
The assert was later in [bug 441259](/show_bug.cgi?id=441259 "VERIFIED FIXED - Placement of floats on a line with content should take account of trimmable width") changed to
NS\_ASSERTION(psd->mX - mTrimmableWidth <= psd->mRightEdge, "We placed a float where there was no room!");
psd->mX is 60
psd->mRightEdge is 0
mTrimmableWidth is 0
I have 60 twips

On 1.9.0 this testcase still gets the assertion from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=465651#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsFrameList::InsertFrame] with -moz-column and lots of floats") and crashes in debug builds on windows and mac dereferencing a deleted address. Didn't see a crash in an equivalent nightly (release) build.
Since this is now a public crash test and nicely flagged as a potential problem by !exploitable we now need to fix it in 1.9.0.x sooner than later.
qawanted: a "fix window" of when this went away on the trunk so we can identify a potential fix.

Can we get a fix range for this bug? We probably do want to take it for code freeze in 1.9.0.11 (tomorrow) given that it's been checked in publicly. (Depending on the fix, of course.)

I've done some targeted debug builds, and so far I've narrowed this to becoming fixed in mozilla-central between Jan 3rd and Jan 5th 2009. (changeset 87d32ea05ca2 is broken, changeset f918c5e6ba7f is working.)
I'm guessing this is due to the SpaceManager --> FloatManager change ([Bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats")) on Jan 4th. I'm doing a build before & after that landed to verify...

Yeah -- changeset 9ffef99c9aa7 crashes, and changeset aa32889429db doesn't crash (but still asserts). So, this was fixed by the Float Manager landing.

Bumping to 1.9.0.12, because we need to decide if we want to take the Float Manager changes on 1.9.0. From dholbert over IRC (because Dan asked me to):
21:37 <dholbert> yeah... I think that's a bigg-ish change :-/
21:38 <dholbert> though in theory, it should have basically zero functional effects, aside from changing behavior in cases of integer overflow (according to dbaron)
21:39 <dholbert> It's a simplification of an existing structure, with the intention of keeping behavior exactly the same, and just adding a few safety checks & overflow checks
21:39 <dholbert> so, as biggish patches go, it might be on the landable side. I dunno though
Any chance this is easily fixable another way?Flags: blocking1.9.0.11? → blocking1.9.0.12?Keywords: [qawanted](/buglist.cgi?keywords=qawanted&resolution=---)

Sorry to make Daniel the stuckee, but here you go. We need a 1.9.0 backport of [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats") plus the three regression fixes from it.

I'm not sure how great an idea that is; that bug may depend on other changes in the 1.9.1 cycle, obviously or non-obviously.

Done -- I attached a patch-bundle in [bug 191448 comment 37](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448#c37 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats"). (and a single combined patch in the comment after that)
I've confirmed that with that combined patch, 1.9.0.x compiles successfully & no longer crashes on this bug's testcase (in my debug build). (I confirmed that the testcase crashes pre-patching, too.)

From backporting, the only \_obvious\_ dependencies were on three code-cleanup bugs: [Bug 432891](/show_bug.cgi?id=432891 "RESOLVED FIXED - remove padding and border values of -moz-float-edge"), [Bug 409331](/show_bug.cgi?id=409331 "RESOLVED FIXED - convert sites that QueryInterface to kBlockCID to use nsLayoutUtils::GetAsBlock"), and [Bug 458969](/show_bug.cgi?id=458969 "RESOLVED FIXED - dead stuff in nsSpaceManager"). (as mentioned in [bug 191448 comment 37](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448#c37 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats")).
However, the non-obvious dependencies dbaron mentions could be scary... I'm only moderately familiar with the code in this patch, so I'd suggest trusting dbaron's intuitions from [comment 16](/show_bug.cgi?id=465651#c16 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsFrameList::InsertFrame] with -moz-column and lots of floats") over mine from [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=465651#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsFrameList::InsertFrame] with -moz-column and lots of floats"). :)

I'll look into the exact cause of the crash here, in the hopes that a single bounds-check somewhere may work as a band-aid...

[attempt at band-aid fix](attachment.cgi?id=383138&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=383138&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=465651&attachment=383138)

I haven't looked at our float or continuation-model stuff for a little while, and there's a lot of that involved here, so this is a bit over my head at the moment, but basically here's what makes us crash:
- We hit this chunk of code in nsBlockReflowContext::ReflowBlock [1]
345 nsIFrame\* kidNextInFlow = mFrame->GetNextInFlow();
346 if (nsnull != kidNextInFlow) {
[...]
353 aState.mOverflowTracker.Finish(mFrame);
354 static\_cast<nsHTMLContainerFrame\*>(kidNextInFlow->GetParent())
355 ->DeleteNextInFlowChild(mPresContext, kidNextInFlow);
When we get to this point in the code on this bug's testcase, the following pointers all refer to the same nsBlockFrame:
(a) mFrame->mNextContinuation->mNextContinuation
(b) kidNextInFlow->mNextContinuation
(c) aState.mOverflowTracker.mPrevOverflowCont
(Note: (a) and (b) are trivially equal, because kidNextInFlow is defined to be mFrame->mNextContinuation)
Now, inside of the "DeleteNextInFlowChild" call quoted above at line 355, we delete the block frame that's pointed to by the three pointers above. However, we never end up clearing pointer (c), in the overflow tracker. And so, later on, we end up making a virtual method call on that pointer, and we crash. Specifically, this happens in this part of nsBlockFrame.cpp [2]:
3139 aState.mOverflowTracker.Insert(nextFrame, frameReflowStatus);
That "Insert" call includes a call to nsFrameList::InsertFrame, passing mPrevOverflowCont (the evil stale pointer) as the aPrevSibling argument. InsertFrame makes a method call on this stale pointer (the call being "aPrevSibling->GetNextSibling()"), and we crash. [3]
I'm attaching an attempted band-aid fix that works around the crash by clearing mPrevOverflowCont inside of the "Finish" method (which is called just before DeleteNextInFlowChild in the first quoted section above). It only clears this pointer if we find that it's in the passed-in frame's next-in-flow list (which is about to be deleted). I'm not sure this is correct, but it's based off of existing code in "Finish" that seems to achieve the same end for the mSentry pointer. It also seems to avoid the crash, while preventing
I'm hoping that someone who's more comfortable with the continuation model (fantasai, roc, bz/dbaron?) can verify if this looks correct or not -- there may be more or less that we need to do in the band-aided chunk, in order to correctly clean things up there. (If this patch is correct, we may also want a version of it on mozilla-central, too, though we'd probably want a testcase that can trigger this on mozilla-central first.)

By the way, I don't think dbaron's FloatManager patch directly fixed this bug in mozilla-central -- I think it just may have just made us avoid the bad execution path on this particular testcase, due to some differences in available space computations.
e.g. I initially looked at where the execution paths started to diverge in pre-patch vs post-patch code, and it looks like we have a particular call to nsBlockReflowState::GetAvailableSpace that leaves mAvailSpaceRect at width=0 in old code but at width=-120 in new code. (And in the new code, this negative width later makes us trigger the assertion mentioned in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=465651#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsFrameList::InsertFrame] with -moz-column and lots of floats"), IIRC). I think there are a few other places like this where the FloatManager computes sizes/positions differently, and I'm guessing that this affects whether various floats fit in certain bands. And this, in turn, affects which floats that we need to make continuations for, and whether we end up going down the execution path that leads to the crash.

This is not a virtual method call, just a read from the frame object.

It's hard for me to tell if this patch is really an improvement. Maybe it's just as easy to delete a frame that's in the overflow tracker's list before mPrevOverflowCont, in which case this patch won't help.
This seems like the sort of thing that Zack's frame poisoning work should help with.

Attached patch

[patch for 1.9.0.x [checked in: c36]](attachment.cgi?id=384770&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=384770&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=465651&attachment=384770)

FWIW, this patch (suggested by fantasai) fixes the crash, though we're not entirely sure why yet.
Intuition behind the patch:
- The idea here is to avoid having two nsOverflowContinuationTracker objects monitoring the same frame-subtree at the same time. ReflowOverflowContainerChildren creates a temporary tracker, which only lasts for the life of that method -- but currently, this method is called just after the nsBlockReflowState (and \*its\* tracker) has been created. So we have two trackers at the same time.
- This patch moves the ReflowOverflowContainerChildren call up to before where we initialize the nsBlockReflowState, so that its temporary tracker is both created & destroyed \*\*before\*\* we make another tracker for the reflow state.

Just looked through nsBlockFrame::Reflow again. It uses the block reflow state (which contains the main OverflowContinuationTracker) to do a bunch of stuff after the current ReflowOverflowContainerChildren call; there's definitely a potential for interleaving calls to the two trackers, which they're not designed to handle. I think either shifting ReflowOverflowContainerChildren up to before the creation of the main tracker, or shifting it down to right before ComputeFinalSize should be the right fix here.

This is hugely hopeful and it is wonderful to see such a small patch after looking at what the space manager rewrite would involve, but it's a little too uncertain/untested to cram into the end of 1.9.0.12 (already slipped the code-freeze a week). Looking forward to this in 1.9.0.13, will this be reviewed and tested by time the reopens in a couple of weeks?Flags: blocking1.9.0.12+ → blocking1.9.0.13+

Definitely. I'm doing some final analysis on what's going on here (will post that within the hour), and then I should have a patch ready for review.

I think the former is what needs to happen (as in band-aid #2), but the latter (shifting ReflowOverflowContainerChildren down) doesn't work.
From testing various options, it looks like the key thing that's needed is for ReflowOverflowContainerChildren to move \*above the ReflowDirtyLines call\*. It can even be called immediately before ReflowDirtyLines -- that still prevents the crash. But if it's called immediately after ReflowDirtyLines (as in existing code), we crash.
More details to come.

[series of frametrees for broken (unpatched) code vs working (band-aid#2) code](attachment.cgi?id=385019)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=385019&action=edit)

I'm attaching a zipped series of frametrees I generated at various points during execution of nsBlockFrame::Reflow for the second column. These frametrees are from the first time that Reflow is called for that column. (I've also tweaked my build slightly to hard-code some starting values for knownInfeasibleHeight and knownFeasibleHeight -- 1979 and 2041, respectively -- to arrive at the crashy conditions in fewer reflows.)
So, when we start this reflow of the second column, its previous sibling (the first column) contains...
(A) an "OverflowOutOfFlow-List" \*\*inside of a child block\*\*
(B) an Overflow-lines list
(C) an ExcessOverflowContainers list
(D) an OverflowOutOfFlow list
At a high level, I think we need to drain \*all\* of those from the previous column before the ReflowDirtyLines call, or else we crash.
These methods achieve this draining:
\* ReflowOverflowContainers pulls (A) and (C) from the previous column (forming the second column's OverflowContainers-list)
\* DrainOverflowLines pulls (B) and (D) from the previous column (forming the second column's normal contents & Float-List).
Now, in existing code, we don't call ReflowOverflowContainers until \*after\* ReflowDirtyLines, and at that point, I think (A) and (C) don't fit in our second column. So, ReflowOverflowContainers ends up needing to make an ExcessOverflowContainers list right away. (and the continuation frame inside that list is the frame that ends up getting deleted later on and killing us!!)
However, if we apply the band-aid and call ReflowOverflowContainers \*before\* ReflowDirtyLines, then we pull (A) and (C) into the second column \*before\* calling ReflowDirtyLines. When pulled this early, they don't require an ExcessOverflowContainers list. Later, when we call ReflowDirtyLines, we find that not everything fits, and so we create an Overflow-Lines list and an OverflowOutOfFlow-list. (These lists aren't created in unpatched code).
At a high level, it seems healthier to get pull the overflowed content from the previous column \*before\* reflowing our dirty lines, because it gives us a better shot at positioning everything correctly. So, bottom line, I think band-aid #2 is the right fix.

[patch for mozilla-central & 1.9.1](attachment.cgi?id=385024&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=385024&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=465651&attachment=385024)

Here's a version of the patch for mozilla-central and 1.9.1, because I imagine we'll want this on those branches before the 1.9.0.x branch.
I'll see if I can come up with a mozilla-central-crashing testcase, too.

patch for mozilla-central & 1.9.1
Note that the only difference between the 1.9.0.x patch and the mozilla-central/1.9.1 patch is the "space manager" vs "float manager" terminology in the contextual code and comments.

(In reply to [comment #30](/show_bug.cgi?id=465651#c30 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsFrameList::InsertFrame] with -moz-column and lots of floats"))
> I'll see if I can come up with a mozilla-central-crashing testcase, too.
I briefly looked into making a mozilla-central-crashing testcase, but I don't think it's easily doable from this bug's existing testcase. It looks like the SpaceManager-->FloatManager patch changed our reflow behavior pretty significantly here, so that now \*none\* of the Overflow lists from [comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=465651#c29 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsFrameList::InsertFrame] with -moz-column and lots of floats") (labeled A/B/C/D) are present on the first column when we reflow the second column.
So, I think this may have to go without a testcase on mozilla-central, unless someone comes up with one. (Technically, this bug already \*does\* have a testcase already checked in on mozilla-central -- the original testcase was landed in [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=465651#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsFrameList::InsertFrame] with -moz-column and lots of floats"). It's just that this testcase is worked around by the Float Manager as already described here.)

patch for mozilla-central & 1.9.1
Requesting approval to land this on 1.9.1 branch, when that reopens (for 1.9.1.1 / Firefox 3.5.1?, I assume).
This is a patch that's needed on 3.0.x to fix a crasher. This particular crash hasn't been demonstrated to affect 3.5 since [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats") landed, because that bug's patch works around it for this particular testcase (and we haven't yet been able to construct a non-worked-around testcase). But this patch a fairly minimal change that makes more sense safety-wise than our prior behavior (see [comment 24](/show_bug.cgi?id=465651#c24 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsFrameList::InsertFrame] with -moz-column and lots of floats") & [comment 25](/show_bug.cgi?id=465651#c25 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsFrameList::InsertFrame] with -moz-column and lots of floats")). It'd be nice to have this on 3.5 in the spirit of "don't land code on old branches until it's also landed on newer branches".

Yup -- the regression is [bug 503961](/show_bug.cgi?id=503961 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: overflow containers out of order\" with -moz-column"), two new assertion failures that Jesse found.
There shouldn't be any pressing need to land this bug's patch quickly on 1.9.1, since this bug is worked around by the space manager anyway, so postponing to 1.9.1.4 should be fine.

patch for mozilla-central & 1.9.1
If we land this on the 1.9.1 branch will we cause the regression [bug 503961](/show_bug.cgi?id=503961 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: overflow containers out of order\" with -moz-column") ?

Since [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats") is an effective mitigation in 1.9.1 and later this doesn't "block" the release, but it would still be nice to correct the underlying problem.blocking1.9.1: .4+ → -

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Attached file
[testcase (crashes Firefox when loaded)](attachment.cgi?id=323993)

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1a1pre) Gecko/2008053113 Minefield/3.1a1pre
Steps to reproduce:
1. Load the testcase in a debug build of Firefox.
Result:
###!!! ASSERTION: aBandRect should be first rect within its band: '!aBandRect || aBandRect == mBandList.Head() || aBandRect->Prev()->mBottom != aBandRect->mBottom', file /Users/jruderman/central/layout/generic/nsSpaceManager.h, line 475
Crash dereferencing 0xc0000017 (note the first digit -- this is not a null deref!)
The assertion also occurs in [bug 410232](/show_bug.cgi?id=410232 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - \"ASSERTION: aBandRect should be first rect within its band\" with floats as document height approaches nscoord_MAX"), but that bug has a different testcase, no crash, and is public.

Attached file
[backtrace of Linux crash](attachment.cgi?id=333851)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=333851&action=edit)

I'm attaching the backtrace of my Linux crash. It's crashing on this line:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/layout/generic/nsSpaceManager.cpp#435>
434 NS\_ASSERTION(aBandRect->Prev() == &mBandList ||
435 aBandRect->Prev()->mBottom <= aBandRect->mTop,
436 "aBandRect should be first rect within its band");
The crash happens because we look up aBandRect->Prev()->mBottom, and aBandRect->Prev() is either 0x1 or 0x5a5a5a5a.
I'm not actually sure if it's 0x5a5a5a5a or 0x1 -- if I break at the crash in GDB and I do "p aBandRect->prev", then it displays 0x5a5a5a5a. But then if I do "p aBandRect->Prev()", I get 0x1. And that call to Prev() seems to have a lasting effect on 'prev', because from that point on, "p aBandRect->prev" displays 0x1 instead of 0x5a5a5a5a. Weird.

FWIW, I get two copies of this assertion before the crash. Just before those assertions, I get these messages:

Attached file
[testcase 2 (crashes firefox when loaded)](attachment.cgi?id=341661)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=341661&action=edit)

Here's a somewhat simplified testcase.
FWIW, the only function of the <svg style="display: table-row;"> element in the original testcase was to insert a huge height. (see [bug 410233](/show_bug.cgi?id=410233 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - <svg style=\"display: table-row;\"> is extremely tall") -- that particular style on <svg> makes it about nscoord\_MAX tall)
So, for simplicity, this testcase has replaced that <svg> with a <div> whose height is close to nscoord\_MAX app-units.

No crash now that nsSpaceManager has been replaced by nsFloatManager.
The first testcase triggers the "bad value" assertion in [bug 472218](/show_bug.cgi?id=472218 "VERIFIED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: bad value\" with float, large padding"), which is about to be turned into a warning. But the second testcase also triggers the assertion in [bug 439204](/show_bug.cgi?id=439204 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: We placed a float where there was no room!\" with text-indent, width"), "We placed a float where there was no room".

In [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=437565#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsSpaceManager::GetPrevBand] with floats after nscoord_MAX of height") Jesse might have been implying it was [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats").

[bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats") hasn't landed on 1.9.1 and doesn't appear likely to based on lack of flags and the size of the patch, but this is a blocking1.9.1+ security bug (and Shiretoko still dies horribly).
Is there an alternate small band-aid fix for the 1.9.0/1.9.1 branches? I'm reopening so we don't lose track of this one.Status: RESOLVED → REOPENEDDepends on: [191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats")Flags: blocking1.9.0.7?Resolution: WORKSFORME → ---Whiteboard: [sg:critical?] need-fix-window → [sg:critical?] maybe fixed by 191448 on 1.9.2Version: Trunk → 1.9.1 Branch

(e.g. by figuring out what in the float manager refactoring fixed this, or even porting that refactoring to 1.9.1, given that it caused so few regressions)

FWIW: In addition to fixing this bug here, [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats") seems to have fixed [bug 467493](/show_bug.cgi?id=467493 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash [@ nsHTMLReflowState::GetHypotheticalBoxContainer] with -moz-column, overflow, clear, margin, fixed pos"), which is [sg:crititcal?] and blocking1.9.1+.
dbaron, is there any chance that [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats")'s patch would be appropriate for backporting to 1.9.1? (and to 1.9.0.x?)

Like [Bug 467493](/show_bug.cgi?id=467493 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash [@ nsHTMLReflowState::GetHypotheticalBoxContainer] with -moz-column, overflow, clear, margin, fixed pos"), this bug's testcase crashes in changeset b087a09f82aa, but is fixed in changeset 496e0cb5c943. (with the intermediate changeset b19f0a7a3c4c not compiling, as mentioned in [Bug 467493 comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=467493#c10 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash [@ nsHTMLReflowState::GetHypotheticalBoxContainer] with -moz-column, overflow, clear, margin, fixed pos")).
So, this was definitely fixed by [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats").

[testcase 3 (crashes 1.9.0 & 1.9.1 debug builds with skinny viewports)](attachment.cgi?id=361806)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=361806&action=edit)

Here's a modified version of testcase 2. It's sized such that it loads fine in the layout debugger, but reducing the width by one 'click' (via alt-F8, rightarrow, leftarrow) is enough to trigger the crash.
To try to answer dbaron's question in related [bug 467493 comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=467493#c8 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash [@ nsHTMLReflowState::GetHypotheticalBoxContainer] with -moz-column, overflow, clear, margin, fixed pos") ("If this was fixed by [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats"), it would be good to know why"), I've spent some time looking into specifically which of the nsFloatManager changes made us start working on this this testcase in mozilla-central -- details to follow.

(NOTE: When I compare "old code" vs "new code" below, I'm talking about code before [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats") landed vs. code after it landed.)
Ok -- in old code, we crash somewhere within this call, in nsBlockReflowState::FlowAndPlaceFloat:
947 mSpaceManager->AddRectRegion(floatFrame, region);
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/b087a09f82aa/layout/generic/nsBlockReflowState.cpp#l947>
At that point, region.y is nscoord\_MAX (because floatY is nscoord\_MAX, because mY is nscoord\_MAX).
If I trace execution back a bit to where mY became nscoord\_MAX, I arrive here:
821 while (!CanPlaceFloat(floatSize, floatDisplay->mFloats, aForceFit)) {
[snip]
832 mY += mAvailSpaceRect.height;
833 GetAvailableSpace(mY, aForceFit);
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/b087a09f82aa/layout/generic/nsBlockReflowState.cpp#l821>
Here, mY starts out as 0, but mAvailSpaceRect.height is nscoord\_MAX. So we end up with an mY = nscoord\_MAX.
This is where new code's behavior branches off from the old code's behavior, though. The above-quoted call to GetAvailableSpace() will end up resetting mBand.mLeftFloats (which is replaced with "mBandHasFloats" in new code). In old code, we set mLeftFloats to 0, \*\*\*but in new code, we set mBandHasFloats to PR\_TRUE\*\*\*. This difference affects our behavior in the next "CanPlaceFloat" check in the "while" condition -- that function returns true in old code (terminating the loop), but returns false in new code (making us continue looping). Also -- if I use GDB to force this particular CanPlaceFloat call to change its behavior & return false in old code, we don't crash.
So -- why do we set mBand.mLeftFloats = 0 in old code? In nsBlockBandData::ComputeAvailSpaceRect, it looks like we increment a temporary variable "leftFloats" for each entry in a frame list. However, in this particular case, that frame list (trapezoid->mFrames == mTrapezoids[0]->mFrames) is a null pointer, so we never get a chance to increment "leftFloats". So mLeftFloats end up as 0.
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/b087a09f82aa/layout/generic/nsBlockBandData.cpp#l186>
In new code, on the other hand, mBandHasFloats is set in nsFloatManager::GetBand -- it's passed in by reference as aHasFloats. In that function, we do bounds-overlapping-comparisons instead of iterating across a frame list. We end up turning on the temp variable "haveFloats" here:
202 // This float is in our band.
203 haveFloats = PR\_TRUE;
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/496e0cb5c943/layout/generic/nsFloatManager.cpp#l203>
So, now I'm wondering why mTrapezoids[0]->mFrames was null in old code. I'll look into that after lunch.

I'm not particularly interested in that question for \*this\* bug, only for \*that\* bug. In this bug, I was intentionally careful about integer overflows when writing nsFloatManager, and this is a bug on a crash \*inside\* the space manager. The other bug is a crash in code outside of it.

ah, ok. :) I won't look into this here much more, then.
FWIW, one last thing here -- the new code actually ends up with an integer overflow on testcase 3, in a place where the old code didn't. Since CanPlaceFloat returns false now (in the situation from [comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=437565#c18 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsSpaceManager::GetPrevBand] with floats after nscoord_MAX of height")), we hit that "mY += mAvailSpaceRect.height;" line a second time, and so now we end up with mY = nscoord\_MAX + nscoord\_MAX = -2147483648 = -2^31. This ends up triggering the NS\_WARNING("bad value") at nsFloatManager.cpp:149, though it doesn't seem to cause anything else bad. Perhaps that "mY += mAvailSpaceRect.height" line should use NSCoordSaturatingAdd, to be safe(r)...?

Attached patch

[band-aid v1](attachment.cgi?id=392622&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=392622&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=437565&attachment=392622)

Here's one band-aid for this. It jumps in at the spot where we're about to delete the BandRect that we later end up crashing on, and it clears the reference that we shouldn't be retaining to it.
This patch fixes the crash (and triggers the added warning) on all three testcases here.

band-aid v1
dbaron -- what do you think of this as a band-aid fix?
Pros:
- Fairly targeted change.
- Only changes behavior when we're already in a clearly-bad state, AFAICT (i.e. it won't affect behavior of normal web sites or expose us to new badness)
- The change to behavior is minimal -- just clears a cached pointer. (moreover, it's a pointer to stuff that's about to be deleted -- so, we do \*not\* want to be using it anymore anyway)

> Ok -- in old code, we crash somewhere within this call, in

BTW -- I'm pretty sure that in [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=437565#c17 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsSpaceManager::GetPrevBand] with floats after nscoord_MAX of height"), I misspoke -- I think I meant to say "we first \*assert\* somewhere within this call" (not that we \*crash\* within that call).
I say this because, when testing a pre-FloatManager build (from changeset b087a09f82aa) as well as a fresh CVS build, I'm noticing that I do hit the assertion within that "FlowAndPlaceFloat" function call, but the crash doesn't happen until later.
Anyway -- the lowest chunk of the backtrace, when we actually crash, is:
> #0 0xb5b7487c in nsSpaceManager::GetPrevBand at /mozilla/layout/generic/nsSpaceManager.cpp:434
> #1 0xb5b749b1 in nsSpaceManager::GuessBandWithTopAbove at /mozilla/layout/generic/nsSpaceManager.cpp:1335

The crashing line is the first line of GetPrevBand (434 in debug builds, and presumably line 438 in optimized builds):
431 nsSpaceManager::BandRect\*
432 nsSpaceManager::GetPrevBand(const BandRect\* aBandRect) const
433 {
434 NS\_ASSERTION(aBandRect->Prev() == &mBandList ||
...
438 BandRect\* prev = aBandRect->Prev();
We crash because |aBandRect| is a pointer to a deleted object.
Going up one level to "GuessBandWithTopAbove", we see that |aBandRect| taken from |mCachedBandPosition|.
The band-aid patch prevents the crash by clearing mCachedBandPosition when the structure it points to is deleted.

I don't think you need the NS\_WARNING; the comment and the code should be enough.
I also think you can get away with setting the cache to something useful; in particular, we know that |band| is still valid, so you should be able to call SetCachedBandPosition(band);
However, I think you actually need to make the same change in a second place: where we delete |prevRect| just below; we can have a pretty-much-identical else to that if (prevRect == band).
With those changes, this looks good to me.

Given the fix, it looks like the underlying bug is a regression from [bug 270392](/show_bug.cgi?id=270392 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Firefox hangs on a page that contains thousands of float:left images"). (If we remember, we can mark the dependency after the patch lands.)
This means that 1.9.0.\* is the only branch on which it is currently present; it hadn't been introduced by 1.8.0\* or 1.8.1.\*, and the code was removed on 1.9.1.\* and later.

Attached patch

[band-aid v1b](attachment.cgi?id=393645&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=393645&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=437565&attachment=393645)

This version addresses review comments from [comment 28](/show_bug.cgi?id=437565#c28 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsSpaceManager::GetPrevBand] with floats after nscoord_MAX of height"), in a slightly roundabout way.
dbaron suggested calling SetCachedBandPosition(band). There's actually a call like that in the code already, at the end of the clause immediately before my previous patch's added "else if".
So instead of changing the contents of my "else if" block, this updated patch just moves the already-existing |SetCachedBandPosition(band)| line outside of the block that previously encompassed it. (This has the same effect as applying dbaron's suggestion to my previous patch.)
I'm doing the same thing below for "prevRect", per dbaron's suggestion.
Cleared the above with dbaron over IRC -- carrying forward r+, and requesting approval.

I've verified that the updated band-aid (v1b) still fixes the crash on all posted testcases. (FWIW, neither of the band-aids fix the assertion mentioned in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=437565#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsSpaceManager::GetPrevBand] with floats after nscoord_MAX of height"), though -- they only fix the crash.)

Nope -- the crash here doesn't seem to be a regression from that bug's patch. I just tested the nightly from the day after it landed...
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9a2pre) Gecko/20070124 Minefield/3.0a2pre

This part should still be true, though. Even if this crash wasn't strictly a regression from [bug 270392](/show_bug.cgi?id=270392 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Firefox hangs on a page that contains thousands of float:left images")'s patch, it definitely depends on a cached pointer introduced in that patch.Whiteboard: [sg:critical?][needs approval][probably regression from 270392][ fixed by 191448 (floatmgr re-write) → [sg:critical?][needs approval][ fixed by 191448 (floatmgr re-write)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Attached file
[testcase 2 (crashes Firefox when closed)](attachment.cgi?id=345372)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=345372&action=edit)

This testcase is tweaked a bit.
- uses <br> instead of newline+"whitespace: pre" to trigger a break
- uses -moz-column-count:1 instead of -moz-column-width to trigger moz-col usage
- Adds backgrounds & a border to show what's going on
- Improved readability of style attribute, using newlines.
Like the previous one, this testcase crashes when I close or reload the tab.

FWIW, I also still get the assertion mentioned in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=430569#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsPropertyTable::PropertyList::Equals] with -moz-column, position:fixed"), using both testcases.

Attached file
[backtrace of crash on testcase 2](attachment.cgi?id=345746)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=345746&action=edit)

Here's a backtrace of the crash triggered by testcase 2.
A few annotations:
- At stack level 8, aPropertyName is the atom for "ExcessOverflowContainersProperty".
- At stack levels 2-3, aPropertyName is the atom for "OverflowProperty". (This is passed in from level 4, which is GetOverflowFrames())
Basically, it looks like we're crashing because we're partway through deleting all the propertyLists in the propertyTable (stack level 12), and then we try to iterate across those same propertyLists and call methods on them ("Equals" in this case) (at stack level 1).

|  | |

Shouldn't we be deleting frame properties when the frame is destroyed? Or do we suppress that during pres shell destruction?

I think this assertion is the same problem described in [bug 468771 comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=468771#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: the pointer to this sibling will be overwritten\" with -moz-column, table"). Not sure if the crash is, though, although it seems likely.Depends on: [CVE-2009-3981](/show_bug.cgi?id=468771 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: the pointer to this sibling will be overwritten\" with -moz-column, table")

This isn't yet fixed in 191, though. I just tested today's 191 nightly, and I got a crash:

dbaron: I can reproduce this using testcase 2 with Firefox 3.0.13 on Mac.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
