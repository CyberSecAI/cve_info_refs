The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde Groupware
version 1.2.4.

This is a major security release that fixes a vulnerability in the form
library that allows overwriting of arbitrary local files with the permissions
of the web server user. It also fixes two XSS vulnerabilities in the
preference system and the MIME viewer library. The local file vulnerability
can only be exploited by users who have write permissions to the address
book. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this release.

Thanks to Stefan Esser from SektionEins for finding the local file issue in a
code audit, and Martin Geisler and David Wharton for finding the XSS issues.

Horde Groupware is a free, enterprise ready, browser based collaboration
suite. Users can manage and share calendars, contacts, tasks and notes
with the
standards compliant components from the Horde Project.

The major changes compared to the Horde Groupware version 1.2.3 are:
     * Fixed vulnerability in image form fields that allows overwriting of
       arbitrary local files.
     * Fixed validation of "number" type preferences.
     * Fixed displaying unknown text MIME parts inline.
     * Many synchronization improvements.
     * Bundled a complete, working PEAR installation.
     * Improved signup support.
     * Releasing memcache lock no longer takes 1 second.
     * Fixes when resetting passwords.
     * Export current locale to the environment.
     * Allow to add address lists as event attendees through the address book
       popup.
     * Fixed several issues with all-day events.
     * Display application name as task list name when listing external tasks.
     * Added passphrase confirmation field for encrypted notes.
     * Many further bug fixes and feature enhancements.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde
Application Framework version 3.2.5.

This is a major security release that fixes a vulnerability in the form
library that allows overwriting of arbitrary local files with the permissions
of the web server user. It also fixes two XSS vulnerabilities in the
preference system and the MIME viewer library. The local file vulnerability
can only be exploited when running an application that uses image form fields,
like Turba H3 (2.3) or Ansel, and only by users who have write permissions to
those applications. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this release.

Thanks to Stefan Esser from SektionEins for finding the local file issue in a
code audit, and Martin Geisler and David Wharton for finding the XSS issues.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP.  It provides an extensive array of classes that are
targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in developing modern web
applications.

The major changes compared to the Horde version 3.2.4 are:
     * Fixed vulnerability in image form fields that allows overwriting of
       arbitrary local files.
     * Fixed validation of "number" type preferences.
     * Fixed displaying unknown text MIME parts inline.

The full list of changes (from version 3.2.4) can be viewed here:

<http://cvs.horde.org/diff.php/horde/docs/CHANGES?r1=1.515.2.413.2.5&r2=1.515.2.413.2.8&ty=h>

The Horde 3.2.5 distribution is available from the following locations:

The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde
Application Framework version 3.3.5.

This is a major security release that fixes a vulnerability in the form
library that allows overwriting of arbitrary local files with the permissions
of the web server user. It also fixes two XSS vulnerabilities in the
preference system and the MIME viewer library. The local file vulnerability
can only be exploited when running an application that uses image form fields,
like Turba H3 (2.3) or Ansel, and only by users who have write permissions to
those applications. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this release.

Thanks to Stefan Esser from SektionEins for finding the local file issue in a
code audit, and Martin Geisler and David Wharton for finding the XSS issues.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP.  It provides an extensive array of classes that are
targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in developing modern web
applications.

The major changes compared to Horde version 3.3.4 are:
     * Fixed vulnerability in image form fields that allows overwriting of
       arbitrary local files.

     * Many synchronization improvements.
