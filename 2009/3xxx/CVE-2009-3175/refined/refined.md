- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `user_id` parameter in multiple PHP scripts (view.php, photos.php, motm.php, forum_message.php) is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or complete compromise of the database. In this specific example, the attacker is able to extract the database user name using a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique.
- **Attack vectors**: HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP files by manipulating the `user_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable web application and manipulate the `user_id` parameter.
