Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-3666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `nullam blog 0.1.2` application. Specifically, the application uses GET parameters to include files, without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application directly includes files based on user-controlled input via the `p` parameter in `index.php`. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files by manipulating this parameter.
*   **File Disclosure:** Similar to LFI, the `s` parameter in `index.php` allows reading content of local files. The content is then displayed on the page.
*   **Multiple Blind SQL Injection:** Vulnerabilities in `news.php` and `register.php` allow blind SQL injection using crafted `y`, and `i` parameters.
*  **SQL Injection:** In `register.php`, the `v` parameter is directly used in a SQL query, allowing for SQL injection.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `e` parameter in `index.php` allows injecting arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **LFI and File Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, source code, or other application data.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can potentially gain access to the database, including usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information. SQL injection could also lead to data modification or deletion.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Attackers can extract database information using time-based attacks.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing, or other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET requests:** All attacks are triggered through manipulating GET parameters in HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application. No authentication is required to exploit most of these vulnerabilities, they are all accessible to a guest user.
