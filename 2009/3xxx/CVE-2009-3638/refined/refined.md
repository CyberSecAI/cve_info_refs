  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) implementation when handling CPUID entries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could crash the system or potentially gain elevated privileges.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Local attacker with access to /dev/kvm",
        "Maliciously crafted ioctl calls to the /dev/kvm device."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local access to the /dev/kvm device (which is often user-accessible), ability to craft specific ioctl calls with a large number of CPUID entries."
  },
  "affected_systems": [
    "Linux kernel versions between 2.6.25-rc1 and 2.6.32-rc4, specifically 32-bit systems."
   ],
  "additional_information": "This issue is specific to 32-bit systems due to the integer overflow occurring during the calculation of memory allocation size for CPUID entries. The vulnerability is triggered by providing a large number of CPUID entries through the ioctl interface of the /dev/kvm device. This can lead to a memory allocation failure or an out-of-bounds write. The fix involves checking the number of CPUID entries to prevent the overflow."
