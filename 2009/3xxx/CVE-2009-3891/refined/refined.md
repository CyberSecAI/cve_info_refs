Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2009-3891:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) issue present in the `press-this.php` file of WordPress. This was due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data. Specifically, the `$_GET['s']` parameter, which contained the selected text to be used in a post, was not properly escaped before being displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `s` parameter, an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code that would execute in the context of a logged-in user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute malicious JavaScript code in the user's browser.
    *   Potentially perform actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying content, stealing cookies, or redirecting to malicious sites, especially given that the vulnerability is exploitable by authenticated users.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `s` GET parameter when using the "Press This" functionality.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be able to create a malicious link that they can trick a logged-in WordPress user into clicking
*   The attacker needs to target a logged-in user with posting privileges.
*   The user must have access to the Press This feature.
*   No other specific capabilities or positions are mentioned, indicating the vulnerability was readily exploitable.

**Additional details:**

*   The patch involves escaping the `$_GET['s']` parameter using `esc_html()` when setting the `$selection` variable.
*   The fix was applied in WordPress versions 2.8.6.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Benjamin Flesch.
