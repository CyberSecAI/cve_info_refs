Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability present in DataLife Engine 8.2. Specifically, it arises from the `dle_config_api` parameter in the `api.class.php` file not being properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application improperly handles user-supplied input, allowing the inclusion of a remote file into the application's execution flow.

*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   Remote Code Execution: By including a malicious remote file (e.g., a shell.txt file containing PHP code), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server where DataLife Engine 8.2 is hosted.

*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   HTTP GET request: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script (`api.class.php`) with a malicious URL provided in the `dle_config_api` parameter.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Network access: The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable DataLife Engine 8.2 installation.
    *   No authentication required: Based on the provided exploit, it appears that the vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit provided is:
`www.site/path/engine/api/api.class.php?dle_config_api=[shell.txt?]`

This indicates that the `dle_config_api` parameter, when passed to the `api.class.php` script, is interpreted in a way that allows the inclusion of the URL specified, `shell.txt?` in this example, which can be a location to a file containing malicious code controlled by the attacker.

The provided content offers more detail than the standard CVE description by including the specific vulnerable file (`api.class.php`) and parameter (`dle_config_api`), along with an example of how the vulnerability can be exploited.
