```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple insecure calls to the sscanf() function within the htmldoc application. Specifically, the `set_page_size` function in `util.cxx`, as well as in `htmllib.cxx` and `ps-pdf.cxx`.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack-based buffer overflows due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing input strings with sscanf.
  - Impact of exploitation: Attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution by providing a crafted input such as a long "MEDIA SIZE" comment in an HTML document or a crafted AFM font file with an overly long glyph name.
  - Attack vectors:
      - Processing a specially crafted HTML document with a long "MEDIA SIZE" comment.
      - Processing a crafted AFM font file with an overly long glyph name
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious HTML document or AFM font file to be processed by the vulnerable htmldoc application.
