  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of the `::$DATA` NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS) in the Xerver HTTP Server, leading to source code disclosure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Lack of sanitization of user-supplied file paths",
      "Failure to prevent access to alternate data streams"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can remotely retrieve the source code of any accessible file on the server, including sensitive information such as passwords, database connection strings, and application logic. This can lead to further exploitation, data breaches, and complete server compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP request with a crafted URL containing `::$DATA`"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the vulnerable server. No authentication or prior knowledge of the server's directory structure beyond the webroot is required."
