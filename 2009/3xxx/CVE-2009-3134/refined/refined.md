Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-3134:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a flaw in how Microsoft Office Excel parses specially crafted Excel files, specifically concerning the handling of malformed record objects. This improper handling leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The core issue is a lack of proper sanitization when processing a specific field within Excel files. This allows specially crafted data to trigger a memory corruption when processed.
-   **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability manifests as memory corruption. This is caused when the application attempts to handle the malicious record, leading to out-of-bounds memory access or other memory-related errors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Full System Control:** An attacker could take complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Email Attachments:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Excel file as an email attachment and convincing the user to open the malicious file.
-   **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers could host a website containing a malicious Excel file, or compromise websites to host it and convince a user to download and open the malicious file.
-   **Social Engineering:** In both attack scenarios, convincing the user to open the malicious file is required for successful exploitation, making social engineering a critical part of the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Remote Position:** The attacker can be in a remote location.
-   **Crafted File:** The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Excel file containing the malformed record that triggers the vulnerability.
-   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction (opening the file) to be successful. The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically without user action.
-   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability, making it accessible to anyone with the ability to send or host the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important," not critical due to the mitigating factor of user prompts that require a user to actively agree to open the file.
- The vulnerability affects various versions of Microsoft Excel, including Excel 2002, 2003, 2007, and Excel Viewers, and the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats.
- Microsoft recommends applying the update as soon as possible to prevent potential exploitation.
- Workarounds include using the Microsoft Office File Block policy, or using the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) for opening files from untrusted sources.
