      "content": "This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Excel. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\nThis security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Office Excel 2002, Microsoft Office Excel 2003, Microsoft Office Excel 2007, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, and Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; and all supported versions of Microsoft Office Excel Viewer and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack.\n\nThe update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Excel opens and parses Excel files, and by modifying the way that Excel handles malformed records.\n\nA remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office Excel parses the Excel spreadsheet file format when opening a specially crafted Excel spreadsheet.\n\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\nExploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel spreadsheet with an affected version of Microsoft Office Excel.\n\nIn an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.\n\nIn a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.",

    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Office Excel parses specially crafted Excel files, specifically within the handling of cache memory.",

        "Memory corruption due to improper parsing of specially crafted Excel files."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, gaining the same user rights as the logged-on user, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vector": "The primary attack vector is through specially crafted Excel files. This can be done via email, where an attacker sends a malicious file and convinces the user to open it, or via a web-based attack, where a website hosts a malicious Excel file that attempts to exploit the vulnerability when opened.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious Excel files, and must convince the user to open the file using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office Excel. No authentication is required."
