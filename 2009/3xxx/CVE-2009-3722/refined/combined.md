## Details

It was discovered that the AX.25 network subsystem did not correctly

check integer signedness in certain setsockopt calls. A local attacker

could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

Ubuntu 9.10 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-2909](/security/CVE-2009-2909))

Jan Beulich discovered that the kernel could leak register contents to

32-bit processes that were switched to 64-bit mode. A local attacker

could run a specially crafted binary to read register values from an

earlier process, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-2910](/security/CVE-2009-2910))

Dave Jones discovered that the gdth SCSI driver did not correctly validate

array indexes in certain ioctl calls. A local attacker could exploit

this to crash the system or gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2009-3080](/security/CVE-2009-3080))

Eric Dumazet and Jiri Pirko discovered that the TC and CLS subsystems

would leak kernel memory via uninitialized structure members. A local

attacker could exploit this to read several bytes of kernel memory,

leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3228](/security/CVE-2009-3228), [CVE-2009-3612](/security/CVE-2009-3612))

Earl Chew discovered race conditions in pipe handling. A local attacker

could exploit anonymous pipes via /proc/\*/fd/ and crash the system or

gain root privileges. ([CVE-2009-3547](/security/CVE-2009-3547))

Dave Jones and Francois Romieu discovered that the r8169 network driver

could be made to leak kernel memory. A remote attacker could send a large

number of jumbo frames until the system memory was exhausted, leading

to a denial of service. Ubuntu 9.10 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3613](/security/CVE-2009-3613)).

Ben Hutchings discovered that the ATI Rage 128 video driver did not

correctly validate initialization states. A local attacker could

make specially crafted ioctl calls to crash the system or gain root

privileges. ([CVE-2009-3620](/security/CVE-2009-3620))

Tomoki Sekiyama discovered that Unix sockets did not correctly verify

namespaces. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a system hang,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-3621](/security/CVE-2009-3621))

J. Bruce Fields discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly use the credential

cache. A local attacker using a mount with AUTH\_NULL authentication

could exploit this to crash the system or gain root privileges. Only

Ubuntu 9.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3623](/security/CVE-2009-3623))

Alexander Zangerl discovered that the kernel keyring did not correctly

reference count. A local attacker could issue a series of specially

crafted keyring calls to crash the system or gain root privileges.

Only Ubuntu 9.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3624](/security/CVE-2009-3624))

David Wagner discovered that KVM did not correctly bounds-check CPUID

entries. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system

or possibly gain elevated privileges. Ubuntu 6.06 and 9.10 were not

affected. ([CVE-2009-3638](/security/CVE-2009-3638))

Avi Kivity discovered that KVM did not correctly check privileges when

accessing debug registers. A local attacker could exploit this to

crash a host system from within a guest system, leading to a denial of

service. Ubuntu 6.06 and 9.10 were not affected. ([CVE-2009-3722](/security/CVE-2009-3722))

Philip Reisner discovered that the connector layer for uvesafb, pohmelfs,

dst, and dm did not correctly check capabilties. A local attacker could

exploit this to crash the system or gain elevated privileges. Ubuntu

6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3725](/security/CVE-2009-3725))

Trond Myklebust discovered that NFSv4 clients did not robustly

verify attributes. A malicious remote NFSv4 server could exploit

this to crash a client or gain root privileges. Ubuntu 9.10 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-3726](/security/CVE-2009-3726))

Robin Getz discovered that NOMMU systems did not correctly validate

NULL pointers in do\_mmap\_pgoff calls. A local attacker could attempt to

allocate large amounts of memory to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 6.06 and 9.10 were affected. ([CVE-2009-3888](/security/CVE-2009-3888))

Joseph Malicki discovered that the MegaRAID SAS driver had

world-writable option files. A local attacker could exploit these

to disrupt the behavior of the controller, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2009-3889](/security/CVE-2009-3889), [CVE-2009-3939](/security/CVE-2009-3939))

Roel Kluin discovered that the Hisax ISDN driver did not correctly

check the size of packets. A remote attacker could send specially

crafted packets to cause a system crash, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2009-4005](/security/CVE-2009-4005))

Lennert Buytenhek discovered that certain 802.11 states were not handled

correctly. A physically-proximate remote attacker could send specially

crafted wireless traffic that would crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 9.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-4026](/security/CVE-2009-4026), [CVE-2009-4027](/security/CVE-2009-4027))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change (except for Ubuntu 6.06)

the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires

you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you

might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to

update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel

version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system

upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
