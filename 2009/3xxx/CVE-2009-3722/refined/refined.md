Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) not properly checking the privilege level (CPL) before emulating debug register access. Debug registers are intended to be accessed only from CPL 0 (kernel mode), but KVM was allowing access from guest userspace (lower CPL).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Privilege Check:** The core issue is that KVM failed to enforce the restriction that debug registers should only be accessed from CPL 0. This allowed user-level code within a guest VM to attempt access to debug registers, which are privileged resources.
- **Incorrect Emulation:** The Virtual Machine Extensions (VMX) would attempt to emulate the debug register access even when initiated from guest userspace, bypassing security mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unexpected Trap/Crash:** Attempting to access debug registers from a guest userspace could lead to an unexpected trap or crash of the host system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service on the host system due to the crash.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability was initially thought to have the potential to lead to elevated privileges, but the primary effect is a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Guest userspace code:** An attacker needs to execute code inside a virtual machine that triggers access to debug registers. This means the attacker would need to be able to execute arbitrary code inside a KVM guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Code Execution in Guest VM:** The attacker must have the ability to run code within a guest virtual machine running on a vulnerable host.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Instructions:** The attacker must know how to access debug registers via specific instructions that trigger the vulnerability within the guest OS.
