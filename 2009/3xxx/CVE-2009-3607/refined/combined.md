| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=526924#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-02 14:42:44 UTC  ``` Ludwig Nussel reported an integer overflow in poppler's create_surface_from_thumbnail_data() function.  cairo_pixels buffer is allocated as:    cairo_pixels = (guchar *)g_malloc (4 * width * height);    <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/tree/glib/poppler-page.cc#n615>  where width / height is read from PDF file.  Some validation of the values is done in Page::loadThumb(), but it is not sufficient to prevent the overflow:    if (width > INT_MAX / 3 / height)    <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/tree/poppler/Page.cc#n547>  This code does not exist in poppler as shipped in EL5, nor it is part of xpdf.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=526924#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-15 07:37:42 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo, fix should get committed to upstream git soon.  This was likely missed before while hardening other gmalloc uses (#526911[#c17](show_bug.cgi?id=526924#c17)), as this uses glib's g_malloc and not xpdf/poppler's gmalloc.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=526924#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-20 09:50:52 UTC  ``` Upstream fix:   <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=c839b706>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=526924#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-26 12:19:01 UTC  ``` poppler-0.8.7-7.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/poppler-0.8.7-7.fc10>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=526924#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-26 12:20:27 UTC  ``` poppler-0.10.7-3.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/poppler-0.10.7-3.fc11>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=526924#c6)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-27 07:05:06 UTC  ``` poppler-0.8.7-7.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=526924#c7)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-27 07:15:09 UTC  ``` poppler-0.10.7-3.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

Package        : poppler
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-0755 CVE-2009-3903 CVE-2009-3904 CVE-2009-3905 CVE-2009-3906 CVE-2009-3907 CVE-2009-3908 CVE-2009-3909 CVE-2009-3938

Several integer overflows, buffer overflows and memory allocation
errors were discovered in the Poppler PDF rendering library, which may
lead to denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if a user
is tricked into opening a malformed PDF document.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.7-3.

An update for the old stable distribution (etch) will be issued soon as
version 0.4.5-5.1etch4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Need more information on recent poppler issues

DSA-1941 lists three reserved CVE entries for Poppler issues, but there
aren't any more details, which makes it difficult to create CVE
descriptions.  Specifically, CVE-2009-3906, CVE-2009-3907, and
CVE-2009-3908 don't have any details as far as I can tell.

Can anybody help?

Yes, that is correct (and has been fixed in the Debian Security Tracker
a few days ago: <http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/poppler>)

I blame it on the new console mouse mode in Emacs 23 which broke copy&paste
from a different tty with GPM ;-) (Disabling gpm-mouse-mode helps, as I
found out later.)

Cheers,
        Moritz

those appear to be typos in the DSA.  the correct CVEs are
CVE-2009-3606, CVE-2009-3607, CVE-2009-3608, and CVE-2009-3609, which
follow in the CVE-2009-360* series of recent xpdf flaws.  hope this
helps.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
