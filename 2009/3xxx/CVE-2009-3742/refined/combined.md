## Liferay Portal p\_p\_id parameter vulnerable to persistent cross-site scripting

#### Vulnerability Note VU#750796

Original Release Date: 2010-01-05 | Last Revised: 2010-01-05

---

### Overview

Liferay Portal is vulnerable to persistent cross-site scripting via the p\_p\_id parameter, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary script in the context of the portal administrator.

### Description

| Liferay Portal is a web portal that can provide Java applets that adhere to the [JSR 168 portlet specification](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=168). Liferay is available as a free community-supported version and also a commercial enterprise version. Liferay Portal fails to properly sanitize data that is provided by the p\_p\_id parameter, which can be provided without authentication as part of an HTTP GET request. The provided data is placed into a database, where it can be displayed to an administrator in another page, such as the Plugins Configuration section of the Control Panel. This allows for persistent cross-site scripting (XSS). |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the portal administrator. |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is addressed in Liferay Portal 5.3.0. Please see Liferay issue [LPS-6034](http://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-6034) for more details. |
