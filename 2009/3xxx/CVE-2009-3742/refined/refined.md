  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Liferay Portal fails to properly sanitize data provided by the p_p_id parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the portal administrator.",
  "Attack vectors": "The p_p_id parameter, which can be provided without authentication as part of an HTTP GET request, is not properly sanitized. The provided data is then placed into a database, where it can be displayed to an administrator in another page.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request with malicious content in the p_p_id parameter."
