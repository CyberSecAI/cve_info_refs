  "cve": "CVE-2009-3388",
  "description": "Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in liboggplay, which could potentially allow an attacker to crash a victim's browser and execute arbitrary code on their computer. These issues were present in Firefox 3.5, SeaMonkey 2.0, and Thunderbird 3.0, as audio and video capabilities were added in these versions.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow leading to heap buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Heap buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution, denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": "By tricking a user into opening a crafted media file (Ogg Theora)",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to craft a malicious Ogg Theora file with large frame width and height values."
    },
    {
      "root_cause": "Improper size calculation in oggplay_data_handle_cmml_data leading to a write out of bounds.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds write",
         "Improper size calculation"
      ],
      "impact": "Memory corruption, denial of service, possibly code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": "By playing a crafted Ogg media file.",
       "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to craft a malicious Ogg file with crafted CMML data"
    }
  ],
  "fixes": [
    " liboggplay was updated to include a maximum video frame size check and to properly handle memory allocation failures.",
     "The size calculation logic in oggplay_data_handle_cmml_data was corrected."
   ],
   "additional_notes": "The initial report was a crash due to a large frame width and height in the headers of the Ogg file, which triggered a crash in libtheora. The fix involved adding a limit to the video frame size in liboggplay."
