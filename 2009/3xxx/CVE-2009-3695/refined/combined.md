# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : python-django
Vulnerability  : insufficient input validation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : #550457
CVE ID         : None yet

The forms library of python-django, a high-level Python web development
framework, is using a badly chosen regular expression when validating
email addresses and URLs.  An attacker can use this to perform denial
of service attacks (100% CPU consumption) due to bad backtracking
via a specially crafted email address or URL which is validated by the
django forms library.

python-django in the oldstable distribution (etch), is not affected by
this problem.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1+lenny2.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Debian (stable)

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2009 10:51:21 +0200
```
Hi,

Manolo Díaz found out, that the 0.28.14-1 version of whitedune needs the
helvetica font (font size 12) to start (current versions of whitedune
can fall back to the "fixed" font and support a X11 style "-fn" commandline
option).

It looks like, the package "xfonts-100dpi" would install a helvetica font
with font size 12, so it should be added to the "Depends".

so long

# regex infinite loop with 100% cpu use in django.forms.fields.email\_re - DOS hole?

We've confirmed the problem. We're working on a patch.

In the meantime, everybody go meditate on the documentation for how to
report security issues.

Yeah, but.  When I tried this on my own production server (Apache/mod\_wsgi) the process handling the request that caused the problem was killed after the deadlock timeout was reached. But deadlock timeout can't really protect you from a determined denial of service attack, so it's still a problem in Django.

This bug has no effect on FreeBSD systems I've tested, so it looks like
it is OS specific.

FreeBSD 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 + python 2.5.4 work fine.

(1, 1, 0, 'final', 0)

real 0m0.086s

Linux 2.6.27 + python 2.5.4 fails.

## Security updates released

Posted by **James Bennett** on Oct. 9, 2009

Today the Django project is issuing a set of releases to remedy a
security issue. This issue was disclosed publicly by a third party on
a high-traffic mailing list, and attempts have been made to exploit it
against live Django installations; as such, we are bypassing [our
normal policy for security disclosure](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/#id2)
and immediately issuing patches and updated releases.

### Description of vulnerability

Django's [forms library](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/forms/) includes
field types which perform regular-expression-based validation of email
addresses and URLs. Certain addresses/URLs could trigger a pathological
performance case in these regular expression, resulting in the server
process/thread becoming unresponsive, and consuming excessive CPU over
an extended period of time. If deliberately triggered, this could result in
an effective denial-of-service attack.

### Affected versions

Any Django application making use of EmailField or URLField
in the following versions is vulnerable:

* Django development trunk
* Django 1.1
* Django 1.0

### Resolution

The regular expressions used for email address and URL validation have
been modified to eliminate the pathological performance case.

Patches were applied in the following changesets:

* Django development trunk: [11603](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/11603).
* Django 1.1 release series: [11604](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/11604).
* Django 1.0 release series: [11605](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/11605).

The following releases are being issued immediately:

* Django 1.1.1 ([download](http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.1.1/tarball/) | [checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.1.1.checksum.txt))
* Django 1.0.4 ([download](http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.0.4/tarball/) | [checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.0.4.checksum.txt))

These releases are available on [our download page](http://www.djangoproject.com/download/) and [on PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Django).

As this issue is being actively exploited in the wild, all users of
affected versions of Django are strongly encouraged to upgrade or
apply the appropriate patch immediately.

### Note regarding security reporting

As mentioned above, this issue was initially disclosed publicly on a
high-traffic mailing list. We'd like to remind our users that the correct
channel for security reports is to send them to security@djangoproject.com.
This allows the development team time to develop a solution and coordinate
disclosure, both to the Django community as a whole and to the numerous third
parties who maintain and distribute packaged versions of Django.

When debating whether a particular issue impacts security, we ask that you err
on the side of caution and always contact security@djangoproject.com; we
will be more than happy to work with you in analyzing and assessing potential
security issues.

Obviously I'm not tracking oss-security closely ennough this week.
Regardless, please still use CVE-2009-3695, and CVE-2009-3610 will be
rejected.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
