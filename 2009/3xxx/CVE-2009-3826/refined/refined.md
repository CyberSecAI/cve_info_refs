Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-3826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by multiple buffer overflows in the squidGuard URL redirector/filter/ACL plugin for Squid. These overflows occur due to insufficient bounds checking when handling long URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** Multiple buffer overflows exist in squidGuard's code, specifically in how it handles URLs. These overflows are triggered when the length of the requested URL exceeds predefined buffer limits.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending long URLs containing many slashes, which triggers "emergency mode" in squidGuard, preventing it from processing further requests.
*   **Bypassing URL Blocking Rules:**  By requesting URLs with lengths close to the buffer limits, attackers can bypass the intended URL blocking rules enforced by squidGuard. The vulnerability relates to a buffer size difference between squidGuard (2048) and Squid (4096 or 8192, depending on the version), as well as how redirect URLs are handled when they contain information about the originally requested URL.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **remote**, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability over a network.
*   Attackers send maliciously crafted URLs with excessive length to trigger the buffer overflows.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the server running squidGuard.
*   No specific authentication or local access is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 2040-1) explicitly mentions that the problems are present in `src/sgLog.c` and `src/sgDiv.c`.
*   The openSUSE Security Summary Report (SUSE-SR:2010:014) provides a concise summary of the vulnerability, highlighting its impact as a denial of service and potential URL blocking bypass.
*   The vulnerability stems from issues related to the interplay of buffer sizes in squidGuard and squid as well as how redirect URLs are constructed and handled.

In summary, CVE-2009-3826 describes a vulnerability where attackers can exploit buffer overflows in squidGuard by sending long URLs to cause denial of service and bypass intended URL blocking.
