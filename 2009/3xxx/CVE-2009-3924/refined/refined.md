{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the PunkBuster server component (pbsv.dll) of Soldier of Fortune II due to the usage of `sprintf` with a fixed-size buffer (4 KB) when generating log strings.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflow vulnerability in `sprintf` function.",
         "Insufficient input validation or sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote server crash. An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the game server.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted \"restart packet\" to the game server via the game client.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to join a game server with the client-side PunkBuster enabled (pb_cl_enable).  The attacker does not require the PunkBuster service to be active because the vulnerability is exploited before checks are made.",
       "additional_information": "The exploit is triggered immediately after the player joins the server and the map is loaded."
