- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Service Links module for Drupal fails to sanitize the output of content type names before display.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An XSS vulnerability may expose site administrative accounts to compromise, potentially leading to web server process compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with 'administer content types' permissions can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'name' field when creating a new content type. This malicious code is then executed when an administrator views the Service Links settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs 'administer content types' permissions within the Drupal system.
