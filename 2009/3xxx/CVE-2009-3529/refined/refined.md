Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3529:

**Verification:**

*   The exploit-db.com content explicitly lists CVE-2009-3529 as one of the CVEs associated with the identified vulnerabilities in radbids gold 4.0.
*   The secunia.com content does not provide specific details about this CVE, but it confirms that Secunia Research team conducts vulnerability research.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The radbids gold 4.0 application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities, including SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `fid` parameter in `index.php?a=view_forum` is vulnerable.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** Similar to the SQL injection vulnerability, the application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection through the same parameter (`fid`).
    *   **XSS:** The `storefront.php` page, when called with a crafted mode parameter, is vulnerable to XSS.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting data. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure or complete compromise of the application's data.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to extract information from the database, albeit more slowly, without error messages being displayed.
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, which can be executed in the context of other users' browsers. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other unauthorized actions.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection & Blind SQL Injection:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable `fid` parameter in the `index.php?a=view_forum` page.
    *   **XSS:** The attack vector is the `mode` parameter in the `storefront.php` page.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   The attacker does not require any special access privileges on the system. The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.

**Additional Notes**

*   The exploit-db entry provides live examples of the exploit payloads and vulnerable URLs.
*   The provided exploit examples use `union select` for SQL injection, and a basic script injection for XSS.

**Summary**
The radbids gold 4.0 application is vulnerable to SQL injection, blind SQL injection and XSS, allowing remote attackers to potentially take control of the application, access sensitive data, and compromise users.
