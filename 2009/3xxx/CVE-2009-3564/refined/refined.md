Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `puppetmasterd` daemon in Puppet versions prior to 0.25.2 and 0.24.9 does not properly reset supplementary group IDs when switching to a different user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper privilege management: Specifically, `puppetmasterd` fails to drop supplementary groups when transitioning to a less privileged user.
- This results in the process retaining the supplementary group privileges of the user that started the service (typically root).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:**  A local user, even if they have limited privileges, could potentially gain access to files and resources that they shouldn't be able to access. This is because the `puppetmasterd` process would retain the supplementary group access of the user who started it, which could include groups like 'disk'.
- **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability could allow the attacker to read files or access resources they would otherwise be restricted from, such as raw disk devices which are often associated with the 'disk' group.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local exploitation:**  A local user on the system where the vulnerable `puppetmasterd` is running can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Service interaction:** The vulnerability is exposed when the `puppetmasterd` process switches user accounts, a normal part of its operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have a local account on the system where the vulnerable `puppetmasterd` service is running.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges beyond a basic local user account to attempt exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was initially reported due to the potential for unauthorized access to disk devices due to retained root groups.
- The Red Hat Security Response Team assessed the security impact as low.
- The bugzilla entry indicates that the vulnerability was addressed in Puppet versions 0.24.8-4.el4, 0.24.8-4.el5, 0.24.8-4.fc10 and 0.24.8-4.fc11, however the fix was backported to those older versions of the product.
- The Puppet website mentions the issue was resolved in versions 0.25.2 and 0.24.9.
