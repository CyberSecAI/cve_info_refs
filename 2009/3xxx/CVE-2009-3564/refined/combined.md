| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=475201#c0)  Till Maas    2008-12-08 14:27:45 UTC  ``` Description of problem: I noticed that puppetmasterd does not initialize its supplementary groups, which may lead to allow puppetmasterd to access files, it should not. E.g. if it is started with "service puppetmaster start", it still has access to all files that allow read access for the supplementary groups of root, e.g. raw disk devices.  I filed an upstream bug report including patches (one needs still to be tested) here: <http://projects.reductivelabs.com/issues/show/1806>  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): puppet-0.24.6-1.fc10 puupet-0.24.6-1.el5  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. # service puppetmaster start 2. # cat /proc/$(ps --User puppet -o pid | tail -n 1)/status | grep Group    Actual results: The output matches "id  -G root".  Expected results: The output should match "id  -G puppet", i.e. the process should run with the supplementary groups of puppet.  The default supplementary groups of root include the group disk, which e.g. provides raw read access on disk devices.  Additional info: I am not sure, whether this really classifies as a security vulnerability, because <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Security/Classifications> only mentions code execution and denial of service, but imho unwanted access to restricted information is a security vulnerability, too.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=475201#c1)  Fedora Admin XMLRPC Client    2009-03-16 16:52:15 UTC  ``` This package has changed ownership in the Fedora Package Database.  Reassigning to the new owner of this component.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=475201#c2)  Jeroen van Meeuwen    2009-06-24 14:07:53 UTC  ``` Pending upcoming release, a great deal of thanks!   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=475201#c3)  Fedora Update System    2009-08-10 15:04:02 UTC  ``` puppet-0.24.8-4.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/puppet-0.24.8-4.fc10>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=475201#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-08-10 15:04:27 UTC  ``` puppet-0.24.8-4.el5 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 5. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/puppet-0.24.8-4.el5>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=475201#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-08-10 15:04:51 UTC  ``` puppet-0.24.8-4.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/puppet-0.24.8-4.fc11>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=475201#c6)  Fedora Update System    2009-08-10 15:05:16 UTC  ``` puppet-0.24.8-4.el4 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 4. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/puppet-0.24.8-4.el4>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=475201#c7)  Fedora Update System    2009-09-11 23:23:41 UTC  ``` puppet-0.24.8-4.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=475201#c8)  Fedora Update System    2009-09-11 23:36:29 UTC  ``` puppet-0.24.8-4.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

The number is: [CVE-2009-3564](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3564)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=475201#c12)  Vincent Danen    2009-10-07 16:53:34 UTC  ``` Re-opening as this issue also affects Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.1.  The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=475201#c17)  Josh Bressers    2011-07-25 19:45:08 UTC  ``` Statement:  The Red Hat Security Response Team does not currently plan to fix this flaw in MRG.   ``` |  |
