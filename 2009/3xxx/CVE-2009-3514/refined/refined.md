Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability:** Multiple vulnerabilities in d.net CMS including Local File Inclusion (LFI) and SQL Injection.

**Root Cause:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user inputs when constructing SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Local File Inclusion:** The application uses unsanitized user input to construct file paths, allowing attackers to include arbitrary files from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `page` parameter in `index.php` and `edit_id` and `_p` parameters in `dnet_admin/index.php`.
- **Local File Inclusion:** The application is vulnerable to local file inclusion through the `type` parameter in `dnet_admin/index.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** Attackers can extract sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords stored in the database.
- **Local File Inclusion:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, including configuration files, source code, and potentially sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** HTTP GET requests to `index.php` and `dnet_admin/index.php` with crafted SQL payloads in the `page`, `edit_id`, and `_p` parameters.
- **Local File Inclusion:** HTTP GET requests to `dnet_admin/index.php` with a crafted file path in the `type` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- For SQL injection, no prior authentication is needed for the `index.php` vector, but admin access is required for the `dnet_admin/index.php` vector.
- For Local File Inclusion, admin access is required to exploit the vulnerability through `dnet_admin/index.php`.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit details include example PoC (Proof of Concept) URLs, demonstrating how to exploit each vulnerability.
- The LFI exploit uses path traversal (`../../../../..`) and a null byte termination (`%00`)
- The SQL Injection uses `UNION ALL SELECT` to retrieve data.
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerabilities are present in d.net CMS and was discovered by SirGod.
