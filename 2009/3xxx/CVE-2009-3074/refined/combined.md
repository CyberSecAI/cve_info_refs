Package        : xulrunner
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-3070 CVE-2009-3071 CVE-2009-3072 CVE-2009-3074 CVE-2009-3075 CVE-2009-3076 CVE-2009-3077 CVE-2009-3078

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications, such as the Iceweasel web
browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-3070

    Jesse Ruderman discovered crashes in the layout engine, which
    might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3071

    Daniel Holbert, Jesse Ruderman, Olli Pettay and "toshi" discovered
    crashes in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3072

    Josh Soref, Jesse Ruderman and Martin Wargers discovered crashes
    in the layout engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary
    code.

CVE-2009-3074

    Jesse Ruderman discovered a crash in the Javascript engine, which
    might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3075

    Carsten Book and "Taral" discovered crashes in the layout engine,
    which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3076

    Jesse Ruderman discovered that the user interface for installing/
    removing PCKS #11 securiy modules wasn't informative enough, which
    might allow social engineering attacks.

CVE-2009-3077

    It was discovered that incorrect pointer handling in the XUL parser
    could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-3078

    Juan Pablo Lopez Yacubian discovered that incorrent rendering of
    some Unicode font characters could lead to spoofing attacks on
    the location bar.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.9.0.14-0lenny1.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.14-1.

For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.1.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner package.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-47

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.1.3/ 1.9.0.14)

Announced
September 9, 2009
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.14
* Firefox 3.5.3

### Description

Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed
several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of
memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with
enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.

### References

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Core :: Layout

Issues in Layout that do not fit into any other Layout component or which span multiple Layout components.

Bugs related to the top level presentation objects (pres shell, pres context, and document viewer), the frame constructor, and the base frame classes, as well as general issues with alignment and sizing, all belong here.

I suspect this is a recent regression, because I think I wasn't hitting this crash before last week.

After poking at this for a few minutes in the debugger, my guess would be that it's a regression from [bug 465928](/show_bug.cgi?id=465928 "RESOLVED FIXED - Avoid SetInvalidateTextRuns in nsBlockFrame::DoRemoveFrame"). However, I haven't verified that, and I'm not really sure.
I started by focusing on the second assertion. What's happening is that we're in nsPlaceholderFrame::Destroy called by nsBlockFrame::DoRemoveFrame via nsBlockReflowContext::ReflowBlock's call to DeleteNextInFlowChild. What I don't know is through what codepath we'd normally expect nsCSSFrameConstructor::RemoveMappingsForFrameSubtree to be called in such a case. Or are we assuming that this frame is empty, and the problem is that it actually isn't? (That's sort of my logic for implicating [bug 465928](/show_bug.cgi?id=465928 "RESOLVED FIXED - Avoid SetInvalidateTextRuns in nsBlockFrame::DoRemoveFrame").)

No crash for me either, on Linux trunk (using nightly & debug build).
FWIW, my debug build spits out a bunch of copies of these messages:
WARNING: bad value: file nsFloatManager.cpp, line 149
###!!! ASSERTION: Computed overflow area must contain frame bounds: 'aNewSize.width == 0 || aNewSize.height == 0 || aOverflowArea->Contains(nsRect(nsPoint(0, 0), aNewSize))', file nsFrame.cpp, line 5566
(Maybe the crash was fixed by the spacemanager --> floatmanager change?)

No, this is \*not\* fixed on 1.9.1 branch. I just tried latest nightly, and it still crashes on this bug's testcase. (No big surprise, given that the suspected fix, [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats"), hasn't landed there.)

That window includes a number of checkins from [Bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats"), so I'm making the dependency on [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats") official.Depends on: [191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats")

I don't see why [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats") should have changed any behavior of things outside the space manager code itself, except perhaps for dealing with very large sizes. Such changes were unintentional, and could well indicate a bug in that change.
That said, [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats") hasn't had all that many regressions. But I wouldn't be comfortable shipping it in a release without having it in a beta.
If this was fixed by [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats"), it would be good to know why.

I'll fire off some builds from right around when [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats") landed, to check whether it's really responsible for fixing this (and if so, which of its several patches did it).

I've confirmed that this was fixed by [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats").
Here are three consecutive changesets (newest first):
changeset 496e0cb5c943 (main 191448 patch): No crash
changeset b19f0a7a3c4c (intermediate 191448 patch): Doesn't compile\*
changeset b087a09f82aa (unrelated): Crash
So, this was fixed by something in these changesets:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/496e0cb5c943>
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/b19f0a7a3c4c>
\* changeset b19f0a7a3c4c's compile error was from something complaining about nsSpaceManager not being declared (probably since it was in the process of being removed). That issue was apparently fixed in the following checkin.

[semi-reference case 2 (doesn't crash)](attachment.cgi?id=361905)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=361905&action=edit)

Here's a semi-reference case, for comparison with testcase 2. Its just got a margin-top value that's .000000000001 less than the testcase, which is enough to save us from crashing in 1.9.1 builds.

|  | |

If I dump the frametrees of testcase 2 & semi-reference case #2 in a patched mozilla-central build (which doesn't crash), it looks like the margin-top value is exactly at the point where we wrap around the signed integer boundary.
Here's a cleaned-up snippet of testcase 2's frame tree
ColumnSet(div)(0)@0xb269528c [view=0xb269b100] {0,0,35640,0}<
Block(div)(0)@0xb26951ec {0,0,17340,0} <
line 0xb2695c18: count=1 {0,2147483520,17340,473} <
Block(div)(0)@0xb2695454 {0,2147483520,17340,473} <
...and here's the matching snippet from testcase 2:
ColumnSet(div)(0)@0xb266128c [view=0xb622b6a0] {0,0,35640,0} <
Block(div)(0)@0xb26611ec {0,0,17340,0} <
line 0xb2661c18: count=1 {0,-2147483648,17340,473} <
Block(div)(0)@0xb2661454 {0,-2147483648,17340,473} <
Notice the change from 2147483520 (2^31 - 128) in the reference case to -2147483648 (-2^31 exactly) in the test case -- that's the integer overflow, and the old code's crash is dependent on that, for some reason.

Ok, so I've looked into why our behavior changed on this testcase, and I think I've got a decent summary.
IN SHORT:
The new nsFloatManager::ClearFloats method includes an initial "HaveAnyFloats" check (with an immediate return, if we don't have floats). However, the old version in nsSpaceManager had no such check. In situations with integer overflow in nsSpaceManager.mY, that made nsSpaceManager::ClearFloats return the wrong value, which made us set "clearanceFrame" when we shouldn't, which messed up our handling of placeholders.
IN MORE DETAIL:
(note: below I use "mXXXManager" to refer to mSpaceManager / mFloatManager)
We start off with an integer overflow in the margin-top value, at -2^31 = -214748364 app-units. This traces all the way back to the CSS engine, with a call to nsStyleSides::GetTop (as "styleMargin->mMargin.GetTop()").
Then, during reflow, this happens:
- We hit a call to nsBlockFrame::ReflowBlockFrame on the innermost block that I listed in the frametree snippets above. During that, we call aState.ClearFloats, passing in 0.
- This method calls mXXXManager::ClearFloats, again passing in 0. (Note that at this point, mXXXManager.mY is -2^31)
- IN NEW CODE: We start out by checking "HaveAnyFloats()". We don't have any, so we just return aY, which is 0.
- IN OLD CODE: There's no initial "HaveAnyFloats"-type check, so we plod ahead through the function. We start out by setting "bottom" = mY == -2^31. Then, through a PR\_MAX call, we end up \_increasing\_ bottom to be mMaximalLeftYMost, which is currently nscoord\_MIN == -2^30. Then, finally, we subtract mY = -2^31 off of bottom, which leaves us with (positive) nscoord\_MAX. We return that.
This returned value is passed back up to nsBlockFrame::ReflowBlockFrame and is stored in "clearY". We compare that to curY, at nsBlockFrame.cpp:2915
- IN NEW CODE: clearY == curY == 0. (they're equal)
- IN OLD CODE: clearY is nscoord\_MAX, curY is 0. (they're \*\*not equal\*\*)
So in old code, that makes us evaluate the next clause, which assigns a value to aState.mReflowState.mDiscoveredClearance. (This value never gets set in new code). This "mDiscoveredClearance" is just an alias for a local variable "clearanceFrame" up a few levels in another call to nsBlockFrame::ReflowBlockFrame. When we set this value, it affects our execution path in that function, apparently messing up our handling of placeholder frames.
Then, the crash happens later on, because we assume the fixed-position block has a placeholder frame, when in fact it doesn't (as indicated in the final assertion in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=467493#c0 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash [@ nsHTMLReflowState::GetHypotheticalBoxContainer] with -moz-column, overflow, clear, margin, fixed pos")).
Note that if I simply tweak the faulty "nsSpaceManager::ClearFloats" call to make it return 0 instead of nscoord\_MAX, then everything goes fine -- no crash, no assertions.

Conclusion from [comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=467493#c15 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash [@ nsHTMLReflowState::GetHypotheticalBoxContainer] with -moz-column, overflow, clear, margin, fixed pos"):
---------------------------
To fix this particular bug on 1.9.1, it'd probably be sufficient to just add a check with nsSpaceManager's equivalent of "HaveAnyFloats" at the beginning of the ClearFloats method, to match nsFloatManager's behavior there. However, it might be better to just take the whole nsFloatManager patch, since it's been successfully baked on mozilla-central for a little while now. (and it also fixes the sg:crit [bug 437565](/show_bug.cgi?id=437565 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsSpaceManager::GetPrevBand] with floats after nscoord_MAX of height"))
We should make a decision about point this ASAP, to make sure that whatever patch that we land for this will get beta coverage.
Side note:
----------
The root cause of this bug is that large positive margin values suddenly overflow into negative territory (INT\_MIN) somewhere in the CSS engine. It'd be much nicer (and would give much more predictable behavior) if we could cap them at INT\_MAX (if not nscoord\_MAX), rather than letting them take that extra step to INT\_MIN. That would probably help a lot with preventing these sorts of bugs.

I checked the crash-reporter database and we don't have any user-reported crashes in there of this crash on 1.9.1. Now, that said, if there is a known fix for this, if that fix has baked on trunk without issue for a while and if that fix also fixes a sg:crit bug, I think we should take it on the branch. This is already marked as "blocking 1.9.1" so, it shouldn't need approval, I think the patch that fixes it ought to just land on 1.9.1.

That's undoubtedly a problem too, but should probably be a follow-up bug.

I'd wanted to get dbaron's opinion first, since he wrote the patch that fixes this (in [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats")) & he briefly commented above on its appropriateness for 1.9.1, in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=467493#c8 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash [@ nsHTMLReflowState::GetHypotheticalBoxContainer] with -moz-column, overflow, clear, margin, fixed pos").
dbaron, (a) does the explanation in [comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=467493#c15 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash [@ nsHTMLReflowState::GetHypotheticalBoxContainer] with -moz-column, overflow, clear, margin, fixed pos") make sense to you, and (b) would you be comfortable with [bug 191448](/show_bug.cgi?id=191448 "VERIFIED FIXED - space manager too limited for handling floats")'s patch landing on 1.9.1?

Here's a patch that simply adds this one check. (Note: I mistyped in the quoted bit above -- the correct function name is "HasAnyFloats", not "HaveAnyFloats")
This fixes the crash on both expected-to-crash testcases, in 1.9.0.x.
dbaron, do you think this check is safe to add on its own?

testcase 3 is WFM on mozilla-central, but it actually crashes on 1.9.1, in both debug builds and in the stock Firefox 3.5 release! (and on 1.9.0.x, as stated in [comment 24](/show_bug.cgi?id=467493#c24 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash [@ nsHTMLReflowState::GetHypotheticalBoxContainer] with -moz-column, overflow, clear, margin, fixed pos"))
Testcases 1 and 2 still don't crash on 1.9.1, though.

<http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/pending/f7955dc3-a1ff-4e8a-a542-bdc8f2090702>
