Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3343:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection in the `details.asp` page of HotWeb Rentals application, specifically through the `PropId` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input passed through the `PropId` parameter in the `details.asp` page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Lack of Input Validation: The `PropId` parameter directly interacts with the database without proper input validation or sanitization, resulting in the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Data Access: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by crafting specific SQL queries. Due to being a blind SQL injection, the attacker would have to infer the results from the application's behavior.
- Data Manipulation/Modification: The attacker may be able to modify or delete data in the database, potentially leading to data corruption or other harmful consequences.
- Complete System Compromise:  While not directly stated, a successful SQL injection could potentially lead to a complete compromise of the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `details.asp` page. The malicious SQL code is embedded within the `PropId` parameter.
   - Specifically, `details.asp?PropId=[SQL Injection Payload]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- Basic Knowledge of SQL: The attacker needs to have a working knowledge of SQL to craft the malicious SQL queries to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code uses the common technique of injecting `1+and+1=1` and `1+and+1=2` to test for boolean-based blind SQL injection.
- The exploit was published in 2009.
- The vulnerability is present in HotWeb Rentals software by www.hotwebscripts.co.uk.
