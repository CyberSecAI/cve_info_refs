```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application suffers from multiple Remote File Inclusion vulnerabilities.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application includes files based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can include remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server if the included file is a malicious script (webshell).
- Attack vectors: By crafting a URL that includes a malicious file path in the `baros_path` or `main_path` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server with the manipulated URL.
