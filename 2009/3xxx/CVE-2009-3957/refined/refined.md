      "Content": "=== Content from www.us-cert.gov_e1422651_20250125_085545.html ===\nAlert\n# Adobe Reader and Acrobat Vulnerabilities\n\nLast RevisedJanuary 24, 2013\nAlert CodeTA10-013A\n\n### Systems Affected\n\n*   Adobe Reader and Acrobat 9.2 and earlier 9.x versions\n*   Adobe Reader and Acrobat 8.1.7 and earlier versions\n\n### Overview\n\nAdobe has released Security Bulletin [APSB10-02](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-02.html), which describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Reader and Acrobat.\n\nAdobe Security Bulletin [APSB10-02](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-02.html) describes a number of vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Reader and Acrobat. These vulnerabilities affect Reader and Acrobat 9.2 and earlier 9.x versions, and 8.1.7 and earlier. Further details are available in the US-CERT [Vulnerability Notes Database](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview&query=APSB10-02).\n\nAn attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file. The Adobe Reader browser plug-in is available for multiple web browsers and operating systems, which can automatically open PDF documents hosted on a website.\n\nSome of these vulnerabilities are being actively exploited.\n\n### Impact\n\nThese vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, write arbitrary files or folders to the file system, escalate local privileges, or cause a denial of service on an affected system as the result of a user opening a malicious PDF document.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Update**\n\nAdobe has released updates to address this issue. Users are encouraged to read Adobe Security Bulletin [APSB10-02](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-02.html) and update vulnerable versions of Adobe Reader and Acrobat.\n\nDisable JavaScript in Adobe Reader and Acrobat\n\nDisabling JavaScript may prevent some exploits from resulting in code execution. Acrobat JavaScript can be disabled using the Preferences menu (Edit -> Preferences -> JavaScript; un-check Enable Acrobat JavaScript).\n\nPrevent Internet Explorer from automatically opening PDF documents\n\nThe installer for Adobe Reader and Acrobat configures Internet Explorer to automatically open PDF files without any user interaction. This behavior can be reverted to a safer option that prompts the user by importing the following as a .REG file:\n\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n[HKEY\\_CLASSES\\_ROOT\\AcroExch.Document.7]\n\"EditFlags\"=hex:00,00,00,00\n\nDisable the display of PDF documents in the web browser\n\nPreventing PDF documents from opening inside a web browser will partially mitigate this vulnerability. If this workaround is applied it may also mitigate future vulnerabilities.\n\nTo prevent PDF documents from automatically being opened in a web browser, do the following:\n\n1.  Open Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n2.  Open the Edit menu.\n3.  Choose the preferences option.\n4.  Choose the Internet section.\n5.  Un-check the \"Display PDF in browser\" check box.\n\nDo not access PDF documents from untrusted sources\n\nDo not open unfamiliar or unexpected PDF documents, particularly those hosted on websites or delivered as email attachments. Please see Cyber Security Tip [ST04-010](/cas/tips/ST04-010.html).\n\n### References\n\n[Adobe Security Bulletin APSB10-02](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-02.html)\n[Vulnerability Note VU#508357](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/508357)\n[Vulnerability Note VU#773545](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/773545)",
