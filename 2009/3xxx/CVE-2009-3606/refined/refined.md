Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-3606:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `PSOutputDev::doImageL1Sep` function within the xpdf library. This function is responsible for handling image data when converting PDF to PostScript format. Specifically, the issue arises in the allocation of the `lineBuf` buffer, where the calculation `4 * width` can result in an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication of `4 * width`, where `width` is read from the PDF file, can overflow and lead to a smaller buffer being allocated than required.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** When the allocated buffer is smaller than required, data written to it can cause a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary code by an attacker.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also lead to a crash of the application (denial of service).

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF File:** A specially crafted PDF document is required to trigger the integer overflow.
*   **PostScript Output:** The vulnerability is triggered when converting the malicious PDF to PostScript, specifically with Level 1 Separable output.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Crafted PDF Document:** The attacker must create a malicious PDF document with a `width` value that will trigger the integer overflow when multiplied by 4.
*   **Target Interaction:** The user must open the crafted PDF file using an application that utilizes the vulnerable xpdf library. The application must also convert the PDF to PostScript, specifically with Level 1 Separable output enabled.
*   **System Configuration:** Specifically for the `pdftops` utility provided by CUPS, the user needs to explicitly set the output level to 1 separable (e.g. via `-level1sep` command line argument or setting the psLevel config option in `xpdfrc`). The default output level for `pdftops` is level 2 and is not vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in various forks of xpdf including those used by CUPS, kdegraphics' kpdf, and tetex.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in xpdf version 3.02pl4 by using `gmallocn`.
*   Poppler library was also vulnerable but had already fixed the issue earlier in their source code and uses `gmallocn` instead of `gmalloc` with a multiplication.

The provided content offers more detail than the CVE description itself. The Debian security advisory (DSA-2028-1) references CVE-2009-3606 as an integer overflow in the PSOutputDev::doImageL1Sep which "might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF document". The other provided content adds context that makes the vulnerability more specific. For example, Red Hat's RHSA-2009:1501 and the Bugzilla entries associated with this CVE note that the issue can be exploited via an integer overflow in the `lineBuf` allocation. The Red Hat advisory also specifies that the vulnerability is triggered when using Level 1 separable postscript.
