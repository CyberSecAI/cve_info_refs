## Details

Solar Designer discovered that the z90crypt driver did not correctly

check capabilities. A local attacker could exploit this to shut down

the device, leading to a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06.

([CVE-2009-1883](/security/CVE-2009-1883))

Michael Buesch discovered that the SGI GRU driver did not correctly check

the length when setting options. A local attacker could exploit this

to write to the kernel stack, leading to root privilege escalation or

a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2584](/security/CVE-2009-2584))

It was discovered that SELinux did not fully implement the mmap\_min\_addr

restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to allocate the

NULL memory page which could lead to further attacks against kernel

NULL-dereference vulnerabilities. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected.

([CVE-2009-2695](/security/CVE-2009-2695))

Cagri Coltekin discovered that the UDP stack did not correctly handle

certain flags. A local user could send specially crafted commands and

traffic to gain root privileges or crash the systeam, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06. ([CVE-2009-2698](/security/CVE-2009-2698))

Hiroshi Shimamoto discovered that monotonic timers did not correctly

validate parameters. A local user could make a specially crafted timer

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2767](/security/CVE-2009-2767))

Michael Buesch discovered that the HPPA ISA EEPROM driver did not

correctly validate positions. A local user could make a specially crafted

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2846](/security/CVE-2009-2846))

Ulrich Drepper discovered that kernel signal stacks were not being

correctly padded on 64-bit systems. A local attacker could send specially

crafted calls to expose 4 bytes of kernel stack memory, leading to a

loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-2847](/security/CVE-2009-2847))

Jens Rosenboom discovered that the clone method did not correctly clear

certain fields. A local attacker could exploit this to gain privileges

or crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-2848](/security/CVE-2009-2848))

It was discovered that the MD driver did not check certain sysfs files.

A local attacker with write access to /sys could exploit this to cause

a system crash, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 6.06 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-2849](/security/CVE-2009-2849))

Mark Smith discovered that the AppleTalk stack did not correctly

manage memory. A remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic

to cause the system to consume all available memory, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2903](/security/CVE-2009-2903))

Lo√Øc Minier discovered that eCryptfs did not correctly handle writing

to certain deleted files. A local attacker could exploit this to gain

root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-2908](/security/CVE-2009-2908))

It was discovered that the LLC, AppleTalk, IR, EConet, Netrom, and

ROSE network stacks did not correctly initialize their data structures.

A local attacker could make specially crafted calls to read kernel memory,

leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3001](/security/CVE-2009-3001), [CVE-2009-3002](/security/CVE-2009-3002))

It was discovered that the randomization used for Address Space Layout

Randomization was predictable within a small window of time. A local

attacker could exploit this to leverage further attacks that require

knowledge of userspace memory layouts. ([CVE-2009-3238](/security/CVE-2009-3238))

Eric Paris discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly handle file creation

failures. An attacker with write access to an NFSv4 share could exploit

this to create files with arbitrary mode bits, leading to privilege

escalation or a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3286](/security/CVE-2009-3286))

Bob Tracy discovered that the SCSI generic driver did not correctly use

the right index for array access. A local attacker with write access

to a CDR could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 9.04 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3288](/security/CVE-2009-3288))

Jan Kiszka discovered that KVM did not correctly validate certain

hypercalls. A local unprivileged attacker in a virtual guest could exploit

this to crash the guest kernel, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu

6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3290](/security/CVE-2009-3290))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Message-ID: <4A9FEA2F.8080501@redhat.com>
Date: Fri, 04 Sep 2009 00:09:19 +0800
From: Eugene Teo <eugene@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
CC: "Steven M. Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>
Subject: CVE request: kernel: NULL pointer dereference in sg_build_indirect()

Backtrace:
<http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/9/3/1>

Upstream proposed patch:
<http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/9/3/107>

Triggered by firing up "xcdroast" to duplicate a CD.

[...]
  out:
  	for (i = 0; i < k; i++)
-		__free_pages(schp->pages[k], order);
+		__free_pages(schp->pages[i], order);

When the allocation in sg_build_indirect() fails, an oops can occur
because of an obvious typo.

This was introduced by upstream commit 10db10d1 in v2.6.28-rc1.

Thanks, Eugene

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
