The provided content relates to **CVE-2009-3264** as it describes a vulnerability where "Content-Type: application/rss+xml" is being rendered as active content.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The browser was rendering RSS and Atom feeds as XML.
*   Some websites did not sanitize their feeds for active content like JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Active Content Injection:** The browser's rendering of RSS/Atom feeds as XML allowed for the injection of JavaScript when the feed was not properly sanitized. This is due to the browser's lack of specific handling for RSS/Atom feeds that are different from HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject JavaScript into a target website via a malicious RSS/Atom feed. This could allow for various attacks such as:
    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS)
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker would need to control the content of an RSS or Atom feed.
*   The target website would need to host and serve this malicious feed.
*   A user would need to access a page that includes the malicious feed in order to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the RSS/Atom feed hosted by the target website.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to cause a user to load the malicious feed within the vulnerable browser.

**Additional Notes:**
* The issue is categorized as "Medium" severity due to the fact that most sites do not include untrusted content in their feeds.
* The vulnerability was fixed by changing the way the browser handles RSS/Atom feeds.
