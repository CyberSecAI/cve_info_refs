Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `pageHeader.php` script in OpenSiteAdmin 0.9.7b is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). This is due to the script using a `path` parameter without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files. This is a classic RFI vulnerability.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes the `path` parameter followed by a URL pointing to a remote file. In this case, the URL `http://127.0.0.1/OpenSiteAdmin/pages/pageHeader.php?path=[thanks.txt?]` is given as an example.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a server where they can host a malicious file.

This exploit provides more specific details than the basic CVE description, outlining the vulnerable script (`pageHeader.php`), the vulnerable parameter (`path`), and providing an example attack vector.
