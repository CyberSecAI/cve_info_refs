  "CVE-2009-3872": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Sun JDK and JRE allow for several attacks, including the remote execution of arbitrary code.",
    "root_cause": "Unspecified vulnerability in the JPEG JFIF Decoder",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Integer overflow",
      "Improper parsing of ASN.1 DER input stream",
       "Insecure handling of color profiles",
	"Timing Attack Vulnerability",
       "Incorrect usage of security model permissions",
	"Stack-based buffer overflow",
       "Expired certificate treated as valid"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted JAR archive, applet, or Java Web Start application, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. Furthermore, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service affecting multiple services via several vectors, disclose information and memory contents, write or execute local files, conduct session hijacking attacks via GIFAR files, steal cookies, bypass the same-origin policy, load untrusted JAR files, establish network connections to arbitrary hosts and posts via several vectors, modify the list of supported graphics configurations, bypass HMAC-based authentication systems, escalate privileges via several vectors and cause applet code to be executed with older, possibly vulnerable versions of the JRE.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted JAR archive",
      "Specially crafted applet",
      "Specially crafted Java Web Start application",
      "Crafted image file",
      "Crafted DER encoded data",
	  "Crafted HTTP headers",
	  "Crafted web page",
	  "Long file: URL in an argument",
	 "Crafted argument",
	  "Large subsample dimensions in a JPEG file",
      "Expired certificates",
	   "Modification of JNLP file to point to a trusted application"

    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious web page. Some vulnerabilities require a trusted environment, user interaction, a DNS Man-in-the-Middle or Cross-Site-Scripting attack."
