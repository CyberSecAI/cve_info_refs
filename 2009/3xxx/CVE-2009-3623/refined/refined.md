Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3623

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect assumption in the NFSv4 server code when setting up a callback to a client. The code attempts to use the same authentication flavor as the client, but it incorrectly uses `rpcauth_lookup_credcache()` to find the RPC credentials. This function assumes that the given authentication flavor has a credentials cache, which is not true for `auth_null`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Null pointer dereference:** When a client attempts to mount using NFSv4 with `auth_null`, the `rpcauth_lookup_credcache()` function returns a null pointer. Subsequently, the code attempts to dereference this null pointer, resulting in a crash.
* **Incorrect function call:** The code should be calling the authentication flavor's `lookup_cred()` method instead of `rpcauth_lookup_credcache()` when setting up callbacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** The null pointer dereference leads to a system crash, causing a denial of service.
* **Potential for privilege escalation (as noted in Ubuntu USN):** While the primary impact is a crash, some sources suggest the possibility of gaining root privileges depending on the specific system state and environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Local Attack:** A local attacker with the ability to mount an NFSv4 share can exploit this vulnerability.
* **NFSv4 mount:**  The attacker must initiate a mount request using NFSv4 with `auth_null`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Local access to the system:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute mount commands on the system running the vulnerable NFSv4 server.
* **Knowledge of NFSv4 and auth_null:** The attacker needs to know how to mount a share using NFSv4 and the `auth_null` authentication flavor.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel version 2.6.31-rc1 via commit `3cef9ab2`.
* It was fixed in version 2.6.32-rc1 via commit `886e3b7f` and then later replaced by `80fc015b` in the same version.
* The vulnerability affects systems running an NFSv4 server that uses `rpcauth_lookup_credcache()` incorrectly during callback setup, specifically when the client uses `auth_null`.
* The Ubuntu security notice specifically states that only Ubuntu 9.10 was affected.
