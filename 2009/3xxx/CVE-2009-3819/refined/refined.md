        "impact": "XSS can lead to unauthorized script execution in the user's browser, potentially stealing session cookies or redirecting to malicious sites. Remote shell command execution allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. Blind SQL injection can lead to unauthorized access or modification of data in the database. Broken session handling can allow unauthorized access to user accounts.",
        "attack_vectors": "Through vulnerable TYPO3 extensions.",
         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to exploit the vulnerabilities in the mentioned TYPO3 extensions. For XSS, this could be through a crafted URL or injected input. For Remote Shell Command Execution, the attacker would have to somehow inject a malicious command through vulnerable parameters. For Blind SQL injection, the attacker would exploit the vulnerability to gain access to the backend database. For Broken Session Handling, this would be by exploiting the vulnerable session handling implementation."
