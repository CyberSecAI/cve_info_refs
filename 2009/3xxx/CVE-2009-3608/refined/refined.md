Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3608:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `ObjectStream::ObjectStream` function within the xpdf and Poppler libraries during heap memory allocation when processing a crafted PDF file. Specifically, the multiplication of `nObjects` (number of objects) by `sizeof(Object)` can result in a wrapped value that is smaller than the actual memory required for allocation using the `new[]` operator. This can lead to a heap overflow during object construction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is an integer overflow that occurs due to the multiplication of `nObjects` with `sizeof(Object)`, leading to a small heap allocation.
- **Heap Overflow**: Due to the small buffer allocation the subsequent writes can cause a heap overflow.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** There is insufficient input validation on the size of objects specified by a PDF file.
- **Improper Handling of `new[]`**: The code uses `new[]` which is not guarded by an upper bound check and does not result in an exception with gcc.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Process termination (crash) is the most common consequence.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** In multi-threaded applications or applications that use crash signal handlers, the vulnerability could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution by writing past the allocated heap region. The likelihood of this seems to vary.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted PDF File:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted PDF file containing a large number of embedded objects leading to an integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to trick the user or an automated system into opening a malicious PDF document.
- No special privileges are needed.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in both Poppler and xpdf, and potentially in other applications forking or embedding the vulnerable code.
- A fix was implemented in Poppler that uses gmallocn, while xpdf has implemented a hardcoded check on the nObjects value.
