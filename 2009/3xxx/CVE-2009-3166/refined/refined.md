Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-3166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Bugzilla handles password resets and subsequent logins. After a user resets their password using `token.cgi`, the new password is inadvertently included in the URL during the login process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the new password in the URL. This can be problematic in several ways.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Password Leakage:** The most significant impact is the potential leakage of the user's new password.
-   **Exposure in Logs/Referers:** This password in the URL could be logged by the web server or included in the Referer header of subsequent page requests. This could lead to broader exposure of the password.
-   **Confidentiality Breach**: An attacker with access to server logs or network traffic could potentially obtain the password.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Password Reset Followed by Login:** An attacker would need to either initiate a password reset on a user's account or have a user reset their password. Then, if the user logs in right after the password reset, their new password is leaked in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access/Server Access:** An attacker would require access to network traffic (e.g., by sniffing) or access to the server logs.
-   **Account Manipulation (Optional):** While not necessary, an attacker might initiate a password reset to force the vulnerability to occur, but it also occurs naturally when a legitimate user resets their password.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- Bugzilla versions 3.4rc1 to 3.4.1 are affected.
- The issue was fixed in Bugzilla 3.4.2.
- The bug report ([https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=508189](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=508189)) provides more technical details about the vulnerability and the fix. The fix involves modifying token.cgi to avoid including the password in the URL.
-  The vulnerability is caused by `$cgi->query_string` returning POST variables when it should not.

The provided information from bugzilla.org also states that this issue is related to [bug 502641](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=502641) which causes login variables to be present after logging in. Additionally, the issue is present when users try to log in while viewing `token.cgi`. This was later confirmed not to be true.

The fix involves a patch that was applied to `token.cgi`.
