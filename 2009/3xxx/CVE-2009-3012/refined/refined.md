The provided content discusses multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities related to how different browsers handle redirects, specifically focusing on the use of `javascript:` and `data:` URIs within `Location` and `Refresh` headers. This is not a single vulnerability but rather a collection of related issues.

Here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**General Root Cause:**

-   The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in the browsers' failure to properly sanitize or restrict the execution of JavaScript code embedded within redirect URLs provided in `Location` and `Refresh` headers. This improper handling allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.

**Specific Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Attack #1: XSS via Refresh Header with `javascript:` URI:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Browsers such as Mozilla 1.7.x, Firefox 3.0.8, Internet Explorer 6, Opera 9.52, and Google Chrome 1.0.154.48 and their previous versions are vulnerable to XSS via refresh-header redirectors when redirecting to a `javascript:` URI.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a URL that, when accessed by the victim, results in the server sending a `Refresh` header that contains a `javascript:` URI with malicious javascript code.
    *   **Impact:** The injected JavaScript code executes within the context of the website which initiated the redirect, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or perform other malicious activities.
*   **Attack #2: XSS via Refresh Header with `data:` URI:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Browsers such as Mozilla 1.7.x, Firefox 3.0.12, and Google Chrome 1.0.154.48 and their previous versions are vulnerable to XSS via refresh-header redirectors when redirecting to a `data:` URI.
    *    **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a URL that, when accessed by the victim, results in the server sending a `Refresh` header that contains a `data:` URI with malicious javascript code.
    *   **Impact:** While modern versions execute the code outside of the site's context, old versions of Mozilla could have the code executed with the site's context. This can still be used for phishing and arbitrary javascript code execution.
*   **Attack #3: XSS via Location Header with `data:` URI:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Browsers such as Firefox 3.0.12 and Opera 9.52 and their previous versions are vulnerable to XSS via location-header redirectors when redirecting to a `data:` URI.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a URL that, when accessed by the victim, results in the server sending a `Location` header that contains a `data:` URI with malicious javascript code.
    *   **Impact:** The injected JavaScript code executes, but not in the context of the site, hence no access to cookies, but can be used for phishing attacks and the execution of JavaScript code.
*   **Attack #4: XSS via Location Header (302 Object Moved) with `javascript:` URI:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Older Mozilla and Firefox browsers (Mozilla 1.7.x and Firefox 3.0.12 and their previous versions) allow XSS via location-header redirectors when the response code is `302 Object moved`, with a `javascript:` URI.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a URL that, when accessed by the victim, results in the server sending a `Location` header that contains a `javascript:` URI with malicious javascript code, and a response code of `302 Object Moved`.
    *   **Impact:** The browser displays an "Object Moved" page. The injected JavaScript code executes within the context of the site once the user clicks the link on the page, allowing for stealing cookies and making more advanced attacks (strictly social XSS).
*  **Attack #5: XSS via Location Header (301/302) with `javascript:` URI:**
     *   **Vulnerability:** Maxthon 3 Alpha (3.0.0.145) with Ultramode, allows XSS via location-header redirectors with both 301 and 302 response codes with a `javascript:` URI.
     *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a URL that, when accessed by the victim, results in the server sending a `Location` header that contains a `javascript:` URI with malicious javascript code, with 301 or 302 redirect code.
     *   **Impact:** The browser displays a "Unable to connect to the site" page. The injected JavaScript code executes when the user clicks "Refresh the page", but the javascript is executed outside the site's context. This vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Attack #6: XSS via Location Header (302 Found) with `javascript:` URI:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Older Mozilla and Firefox browsers (Mozilla 1.7.x and Firefox 3.0.19 and their previous versions) allow XSS via location-header redirectors when the response code is `302 Found` with a `javascript:` URI.
    *   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a URL that, when accessed by the victim, results in the server sending a `Location` header that contains a `javascript:` URI with malicious javascript code, and a response code of `302 Found`.
    *   **Impact:** The browser displays a "Found" page. The injected JavaScript code executes within the context of the site once the user clicks the link on the page, allowing for stealing cookies and making more advanced attacks (strictly social XSS).
*   **Attacks #7, #8: XSS via Redirectors 301 and 303 with `data:` and `javascript:` URI:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** This entry mentions two more attacks via redirectors with status codes 301 and 303, using `data:` and `javascript:` URIs but the specifics were not given.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The primary attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious code within the `param` parameter of a script on the target website. This crafted URL is designed to trigger a redirect with a malicious `javascript:` or `data:` URI in either the `Location` or `Refresh` header.
-   This can be utilized in phishing attacks by sending a crafted URL.
-   The attack can also be used when an attacker is able to control a website's redirection service, such as tinyurl.com, to spread malware when they set the code of an exploit instead of an address.

**Attacker Capabilities:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that the victim will access.
-   The attacker needs a website that is vulnerable to redirecting URLs from the user in a `Location` or `Refresh` header, which are common.
-   The attacker does not need their own site for the attack, making it harder to trace the attacker and impossible to shut down their site.

**Impact:**

-   **Cookie Theft:** If the JavaScript code is executed in the context of the vulnerable website, the attacker can steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the victim.
-   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can redirect users to fake login pages or other malicious content using `data:` URLs, even if the javascript is not executed within the site's context.
-   **Malware Distribution:** By embedding malicious code in the redirect, attackers can spread malware.
-   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to a range of malicious actions depending on the vulnerabilities present in the website or browser.
-   **Bypass of Anti-Phishing Filters:** Use of `data:` URIs can bypass anti-phishing filters in browsers and email clients.

**Mitigation:**

-   The mitigation is to have browsers not execute javascript from `javascript:` and `data:` URIs in `Location` and `Refresh` headers.
-   Websites should not be reflecting the user-controlled input in redirect headers.

**Relation to CVE-2009-3012:**
