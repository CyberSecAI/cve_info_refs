1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update fixes a several security issues and various bugs in the
SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP 2 kernel.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2009-3547: A race condition during pipe open could be used by
local attackers to elevate privileges.
CVE-2009-2910: On x86\_64 systems an information leak of high register
contents (upper 32bit) was fixed.
CVE-2009-3238: The randomness of the ASLR methods used in the kernel
was increased.
CVE-2009-1192: A information leak from the kernel due to uninitialized
memory in AGP handling was fixed.
CVE-2009-2909: A signed comparison in the ax25 sockopt handler
was fixed which could be used to crash the kernel or potentially
execute code.
CVE-2009-2848: The execve function in the Linux kernel did not properly
clear the current->clear\_child\_tid pointer, which allows local
users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly
gain privileges via a clone system call with CLONE\_CHILD\_SETTID or
CLONE\_CHILD\_CLEARTID enabled, which is not properly handled during
thread creation and exit.
CVE-2009-3002: Fixed various socket handler getname leaks, which
could disclose memory previously used by the kernel or other userland
processes to the local attacker.
CVE-2009-1633: Multiple buffer overflows in the cifs subsystem in the
Linux kernel allow remote CIFS servers to cause a denial of service
(memory corruption) and possibly have unspecified other impact via (1)
a malformed Unicode string, related to Unicode string area alignment
in fs/cifs/sess.c; or (2) long Unicode characters, related to
fs/cifs/cifssmb.c and the cifs\_readdir function in fs/cifs/readdir.c.
Also see the RPM changelog for more changes.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

RHSA-2009:1540 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2009-11-03
Updated:
2009-11-03
# RHSA-2009:1540 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix several security issues, multiple bugs,
and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.1.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* the ADDR\_COMPAT\_LAYOUT and MMAP\_PAGE\_ZERO flags were not cleared when a

setuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to bypass the mmap\_min\_addr protection mechanism and perform a
NULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)

* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local

users in the unconfined\_t domain to map low memory areas even if the
mmap\_min\_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local
exploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in getname() implementations in

numerous network protocol implementations in the Linux kernel. Certain
data structures in these getname() implementations were not initialized
properly before being copied to user-space. These flaws could lead to an
information leak. (CVE-2009-3002, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux

kernel. pci\_unmap\_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
abuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.
(CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the r128 driver in the

Linux kernel. Checks to test if the Concurrent Command Engine state was
initialized were missing in private IOCTL functions. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a local denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2009-3620, Important)

* Kees Cook and Steve Beattie discovered a race condition in the /proc

code in the Linux kernel. This could lead to information in the
"/proc/[pid]/maps" and "/proc/[pid]/smaps" files being leaked to users (who
would otherwise not have access to this information) during ELF loading.
This could help a local attacker bypass the ASLR security feature.
(CVE-2009-2691, Moderate)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the md driver in the Linux

kernel. If the suspend\_lo or suspend\_hi file in "/sys/" is modified when
the disk array is inactive, it could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. By default, only root can write to these two files.
(CVE-2009-2849, Moderate)

* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,

32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. (CVE-2009-2910, Moderate)

* padding data in several core network structures was not initialized

properly before being sent to user-space, possibly leading to information
leaks. (CVE-2009-3228, CVE-2009-3612, Moderate)

* the unix\_stream\_connect() function in the Linux kernel did not check if a

UNIX domain socket was in the shutdown state. This could lead to a
deadlock. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2009-3621, Moderate)

These updated packages also include bug fixes and enhancements. Users are
directed to the Realtime Security Update Release Notes for version 1.1 for
information on these changes, which will be available shortly from:

<http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_MRG/>

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues and add enhancements. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

There are some more fixes that addressed similar infoleaks:

e84b90ae5eb3c112d1f208964df1d8156a538289
     can: Fix raw_getname() leak
09384dfc76e526c3993c09c42e016372dc9dd22c
     irda: Fix irda_getname() leak
3d392475c873c10c10d6d96b94d092a34ebd4791
     appletalk: fix atalk_getname() leak
f6b97b29513950bfbf621a83d85b6f86b39ec8db
     netrom: Fix nr_getname() leak
80922bbb12a105f858a8f0abb879cb4302d0ecaa
     econet: Fix econet_getname() leak
17ac2e9c58b69a1e25460a568eae1b0dc0188c25
     rose: Fix rose_getname() leak

It would make sense to address these with the same CVE name as this one.

Thanks, Eugene

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The raw_getname() leak was introduced in the Linux kernel version 2.6.25-rc1. The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG did not have a backport of this patch, and therefore are not affected by this issue.  The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG did not enable support for IrDA sockets, and therefore are not affected by this issue. A future kernel update for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 will address this flaw.  The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 did not enable support for the AppleTalk DDP protocol, and therefore are not affected by this issue. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG will address this flaw.  The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG did not enable support for the NET/ROM and ROSE protocols, and therefore are not affected by this issue. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 will address this flaw.  And finally, the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG did not enable support for the Acorn Econet and AUN protocols, and therefore are not affected by this issue.

contents (upper 32bit) was fixed.
CVE-2009-1192: The (1) agp\_generic\_alloc\_page and (2)
agp\_generic\_alloc\_pages functions in drivers/char/agp/generic.c in
the agp subsystem in the Linux kernel do not zero out pages that may
later be available to a user-space process, which allows local users
to obtain sensitive information by reading these pages.
CVE-2009-2909: Unsigned check in the ax25 socket handler could allow
local attackers to potentially crash the kernel or even execute code.
CVE-2009-2848: The execve function in the Linux kernel did not properly
clear the current->clear\_child\_tid pointer, which allows local
users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly
gain privileges via a clone system call with CLONE\_CHILD\_SETTID or
CLONE\_CHILD\_CLEARTID enabled, which is not properly handled during
thread creation and exit.
CVE-2009-3002: Fixed various socket handler getname leaks, which
could disclose memory previously used by the kernel or other userland
processes to the local attacker.
CVE-2009-1633: Multiple buffer overflows in the cifs subsystem in the
Linux kernel allow remote CIFS servers to cause a denial of service
(memory corruption) and possibly have unspecified other impact via (1)
a malformed Unicode string, related to Unicode string area alignment
in fs/cifs/sess.c; or (2) long Unicode characters, related to
fs/cifs/cifssmb.c and the cifs\_readdir function in fs/cifs/readdir.c.
CVE-2009-3726: The nfs4\_proc\_lock function in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c in
the NFSv4 client in the allows remote NFS servers to cause a denial
of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) by sending a certain
response containing incorrect file attributes, which trigger attempted
use of an open file that lacks NFSv4 state.
For a complete list of changes, please refer to the RPM changelog.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

RHSA-2009:1550 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2009-11-03
Updated:
2009-11-03
# RHSA-2009:1550 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix several security issues and multiple bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* when fput() was called to close a socket, the \_\_scm\_destroy() function in

the Linux kernel could make indirect recursive calls to itself. This could,
potentially, lead to a denial of service issue. (CVE-2008-5029, Important)

* the sendmsg() function in the Linux kernel did not block during UNIX

socket garbage collection. This could, potentially, lead to a local denial
of service. (CVE-2008-5300, Important)

* the exit\_notify() function in the Linux kernel did not properly reset the

exit signal if a process executed a set user ID (setuid) application before
exiting. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to elevate their
privileges. (CVE-2009-1337, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Intel PRO/1000 network driver in the Linux

kernel. Frames with sizes near the MTU of an interface may be split across
multiple hardware receive descriptors. Receipt of such a frame could leak
through a validation check, leading to a corruption of the length check. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted packet that
would cause a denial of service or code execution. (CVE-2009-1385,
Important)

* the ADDR\_COMPAT\_LAYOUT and MMAP\_PAGE\_ZERO flags were not cleared when a

setuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to bypass the mmap\_min\_addr protection mechanism and perform a
NULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)

* it was discovered that, when executing a new process, the clear\_child\_tid

pointer in the Linux kernel is not cleared. If this pointer points to a
writable portion of the memory of the new program, the kernel could corrupt
four bytes of memory, possibly leading to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-2848, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in getname() implementations in

the IrDA sockets, AppleTalk DDP protocol, NET/ROM protocol, and ROSE
protocol implementations in the Linux kernel. Certain data structures in
these getname() implementations were not initialized properly before being
copied to user-space. These flaws could lead to an information leak.
(CVE-2009-3002, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

Bug fixes:

* this update adds the mmap\_min\_addr tunable and restriction checks to help

prevent unprivileged users from creating new memory mappings below the
minimum address. This can help prevent the exploitation of NULL pointer
dereference bugs. Note that mmap\_min\_addr is set to zero (disabled) by
default for backwards compatibility. (BZ#512642)

* a bridge reference count problem in IPv6 has been fixed. (BZ#457010)
* enforce null-termination of user-supplied arguments to setsockopt().

(BZ#505514)

* the gcc flag "-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks" was added to the kernel

build options. This prevents gcc from optimizing out NULL pointer checks
after the first use of a pointer. NULL pointer bugs are often exploited by
attackers. Keeping these checks is a safety measure. (BZ#511185)

* a check has been added to the IPv4 code to make sure that rt is not NULL,

to help prevent future bugs in functions that call ip\_append\_data() from
being exploitable. (BZ#520300)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This kernel update for openSUSE 11.0 fixes some bugs and several
security problems.
The following security issues are fixed:
CVE-2009-4536: drivers/net/e1000/e1000\_main.c in the e1000 driver
in the Linux kernel handles Ethernet frames that exceed the MTU by
processing certain trailing payload data as if it were a complete
frame, which allows remote attackers to bypass packet filters via a
large packet with a crafted payload.
CVE-2009-4538: drivers/net/e1000e/netdev.c in the e1000e driver in
the Linux kernel does not properly check the size of an Ethernet
frame that exceeds the MTU, which allows remote attackers to have an
unspecified impact via crafted packets.
CVE-2010-0007: Missing CAP\_NET\_ADMIN checks in the ebtables netfilter
code might have allowed local attackers to modify bridge firewall
settings.
CVE-2010-0003: An information leakage on fatal signals on x86\_64
machines was fixed.
CVE-2009-4138: drivers/firewire/ohci.c in the Linux kernel, when
packet-per-buffer mode is used, allows local users to cause a denial
of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly
have unknown other impact via an unspecified ioctl associated with
receiving an ISO packet that contains zero in the payload-length field.
CVE-2009-4308: The ext4\_decode\_error function in fs/ext4/super.c
in the ext4 filesystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32 allows
user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference), and possibly have unspecified other impact,
via a crafted read-only filesystem that lacks a journal.
CVE-2009-3939: The poll\_mode\_io file for the megaraid\_sas driver in
the Linux kernel 2.6.31.6 and earlier has world-writable permissions,
which allows local users to change the I/O mode of the driver by
modifying this file.
CVE-2009-4021: The fuse\_direct\_io function in fs/fuse/file.c in the
fuse subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32-rc7 might allow
attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference
and OOPS) via vectors possibly related to a memory-consumption attack.
CVE-2009-3547: A race condition in the pipe(2) system call could be
used by local attackers to hang the machine. The kernel in Moblin
2.0 uses NULL ptr protection which avoids code execution possibilities.
CVE-2009-2903: Memory leak in the AppleTalk subsystem in the Linux
kernel 2.4.x through 2.4.37.6 and 2.6.x through 2.6.31, when the
AppleTalk and ipddp modules are loaded but the ipddp"N" device is
not found, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(memory consumption) via IP-DDP datagrams.
CVE-2009-3621: net/unix/af\_unix.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.31.4 and
earlier allows local users to cause a denial of service (system hang)
by creating an abstract-namespace AF\_UNIX listening socket, performing
a shutdown operation on this socket, and then performing a series of
connect operations to this socket.
CVE-2009-3612: The tcf\_fill\_node function in net/sched/cls\_api.c in
the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.32-rc5,
and 2.4.37.6 and earlier, does not initialize a certain tcm\_\_pad2
structure member, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive
information from kernel memory via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2009-3620: The ATI Rage 128 (aka r128) driver in the Linux kernel
before 2.6.31-git11 does not properly verify Concurrent Command Engine
(CCE) state initialization, which allows local users to cause a denial
of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly
gain privileges via unspecified ioctl calls.
CVE-2009-3726: The nfs4\_proc\_lock function in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c in
the NFSv4 client in the Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc4 allows remote
NFS servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
and panic) by sending a certain response containing incorrect file
attributes, which trigger attempted use of an open file that lacks
NFSv4 state.
CVE-2009-3286: NFSv4 in the Linux kernel 2.6.18, and possibly other
versions, does not properly clean up an inode when an O\_EXCL create
fails, which causes files to be created with insecure settings such
as setuid bits, and possibly allows local users to gain privileges,
related to the execution of the do\_open\_permission function even when
a create fails.
CVE-2009-2910: arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S in the Linux kernel before
2.6.31.4 on the x86\_64 platform does not clear certain kernel
registers before a return to user mode, which allows local users to
read register values from an earlier process by switching an ia32
process to 64-bit mode.
CVE-2009-3238: The get\_random\_int function in drivers/char/random.c
in the Linux kernel before 2.6.30 produces insufficiently random
numbers, which allows attackers to predict the return value, and
possibly defeat protection mechanisms based on randomization, via
vectors that leverage the function's tendency to "return the same
value over and over again for long stretches of time."
CVE-2009-2848: The execve function in the Linux kernel,
possibly 2.6.30-rc6 and earlier, does not properly clear the
current->clear\_child\_tid pointer, which allows local users to cause a
denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly gain privileges via
a clone system call with CLONE\_CHILD\_SETTID or CLONE\_CHILD\_CLEARTID
enabled, which is not properly handled during thread creation and exit.
CVE-2009-3002: The Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc7 does not initialize
certain data structures within getname functions, which allows
local users to read the contents of some kernel memory locations
by calling getsockname on (1) an AF\_APPLETALK socket, related to
the atalk\_getname function in net/appletalk/ddp.c; (2) an AF\_IRDA
socket, related to the irda\_getname function in net/irda/af\_irda.c;
(3) an AF\_ECONET socket, related to the econet\_getname function
in net/econet/af\_econet.c; (4) an AF\_NETROM socket, related to the
nr\_getname function in net/netrom/af\_netrom.c; (5) an AF\_ROSE socket,
related to the rose\_getname function in net/rose/af\_rose.c; or (6)
a raw CAN socket, related to the raw\_getname function in net/can/raw.c.
CVE-2009-1633: Multiple buffer overflows in the cifs subsystem
in the Linux kernel before 2.6.29.4 allow remote CIFS servers to
cause a denial of service (memory corruption) and possibly have
unspecified other impact via (1) a malformed Unicode string, related
to Unicode string area alignment in fs/cifs/sess.c; or (2) long Unicode
characters, related to fs/cifs/cifssmb.c and the cifs\_readdir function
in fs/cifs/readdir.c.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## Details

Solar Designer discovered that the z90crypt driver did not correctly

check capabilities. A local attacker could exploit this to shut down

the device, leading to a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06.

([CVE-2009-1883](/security/CVE-2009-1883))

Michael Buesch discovered that the SGI GRU driver did not correctly check

the length when setting options. A local attacker could exploit this

to write to the kernel stack, leading to root privilege escalation or

a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2584](/security/CVE-2009-2584))

It was discovered that SELinux did not fully implement the mmap\_min\_addr

restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to allocate the

NULL memory page which could lead to further attacks against kernel

NULL-dereference vulnerabilities. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected.

([CVE-2009-2695](/security/CVE-2009-2695))

Cagri Coltekin discovered that the UDP stack did not correctly handle

certain flags. A local user could send specially crafted commands and

traffic to gain root privileges or crash the systeam, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06. ([CVE-2009-2698](/security/CVE-2009-2698))

Hiroshi Shimamoto discovered that monotonic timers did not correctly

validate parameters. A local user could make a specially crafted timer

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2767](/security/CVE-2009-2767))

Michael Buesch discovered that the HPPA ISA EEPROM driver did not

correctly validate positions. A local user could make a specially crafted

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2846](/security/CVE-2009-2846))

Ulrich Drepper discovered that kernel signal stacks were not being

correctly padded on 64-bit systems. A local attacker could send specially

crafted calls to expose 4 bytes of kernel stack memory, leading to a

loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-2847](/security/CVE-2009-2847))

Jens Rosenboom discovered that the clone method did not correctly clear

certain fields. A local attacker could exploit this to gain privileges

or crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-2848](/security/CVE-2009-2848))

It was discovered that the MD driver did not check certain sysfs files.

A local attacker with write access to /sys could exploit this to cause

a system crash, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 6.06 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-2849](/security/CVE-2009-2849))

Mark Smith discovered that the AppleTalk stack did not correctly

manage memory. A remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic

to cause the system to consume all available memory, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2903](/security/CVE-2009-2903))

Loïc Minier discovered that eCryptfs did not correctly handle writing

to certain deleted files. A local attacker could exploit this to gain

root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-2908](/security/CVE-2009-2908))

It was discovered that the LLC, AppleTalk, IR, EConet, Netrom, and

ROSE network stacks did not correctly initialize their data structures.

A local attacker could make specially crafted calls to read kernel memory,

leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3001](/security/CVE-2009-3001), [CVE-2009-3002](/security/CVE-2009-3002))

It was discovered that the randomization used for Address Space Layout

Randomization was predictable within a small window of time. A local

attacker could exploit this to leverage further attacks that require

knowledge of userspace memory layouts. ([CVE-2009-3238](/security/CVE-2009-3238))

Eric Paris discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly handle file creation

failures. An attacker with write access to an NFSv4 share could exploit

this to create files with arbitrary mode bits, leading to privilege

escalation or a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3286](/security/CVE-2009-3286))

Bob Tracy discovered that the SCSI generic driver did not correctly use

the right index for array access. A local attacker with write access

to a CDR could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 9.04 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3288](/security/CVE-2009-3288))

Jan Kiszka discovered that KVM did not correctly validate certain

hypercalls. A local unprivileged attacker in a virtual guest could exploit

this to crash the guest kernel, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu

6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3290](/security/CVE-2009-3290))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5 or Red Hat Enterprise MRG. Red Hat does not provide support for PF_LLC sockets in the Linux kernels.   [CVE-2009-3002](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3002)  <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-3002>  [CVE-2009-3002](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3002) describes a collection of similar information leaks that affect numerous networking protocols.  The raw_getname() leak was introduced in the Linux kernel version 2.6.25-rc1. The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG did not have a backport of this patch, and therefore are not affected by this issue.  The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG did not enable support for IrDA sockets, and therefore are not affected by this issue. A future kernel update for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 will address this flaw.  The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 did not enable support for the AppleTalk DDP protocol, and therefore are not affected by this issue. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG will address this flaw.  The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG did not enable support for the NET/ROM and ROSE protocols, and therefore are not affected by this issue. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 will address this flaw.  And finally, the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG did not enable support for the Acorn Econet and AUN protocols, and therefore are not affected by this issue.
