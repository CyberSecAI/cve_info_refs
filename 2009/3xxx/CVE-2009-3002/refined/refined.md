  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2009-3002",
    "description": "The Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc7 does not initialize certain data structures within getname functions, which allows local users to read the contents of some kernel memory locations by calling getsockname on (1) an AF_APPLETALK socket, related to the atalk_getname function in net/appletalk/ddp.c; (2) an AF_IRDA socket, related to the irda_getname function in net/irda/af_irda.c; (3) an AF_ECONET socket, related to the econet_getname function in net/econet/af_econet.c; (4) an AF_NETROM socket, related to the nr_getname function in net/netrom/af_netrom.c; (5) an AF_ROSE socket, related to the rose_getname function in net/rose/af_rose.c; or (6) a raw CAN socket, related to the raw_getname function in net/can/raw.c.",
    "affected_components": [
      "net/appletalk/ddp.c (atalk_getname)",
      "net/irda/af_irda.c (irda_getname)",
      "net/econet/af_econet.c (econet_getname)",
      "net/netrom/af_netrom.c (nr_getname)",
      "net/rose/af_rose.c (rose_getname)",
      "net/can/raw.c (raw_getname)"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `getname` function implementations in various networking protocols within the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data structures before copying them to user space.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Leak: Uninitialized memory is leaked to user space via getsockname calls."
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can potentially read sensitive kernel memory by exploiting this vulnerability, leading to a loss of privacy.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user execution of the `getsockname` system call on specific types of sockets (AF_APPLETALK, AF_IRDA, AF_ECONET, AF_NETROM, AF_ROSE, raw CAN)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to execute code locally on the target system. They do not need elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability.",
     "additional_details": "The issue stems from missing initializations within `getname` implementations in various network protocols. The vulnerability exists in Linux kernel versions prior to 2.6.31-rc7. The leak can expose varying amounts of kernel memory depending on the protocol (e.g., 8 bytes for AppleTalk, 10 bytes for CAN)."
