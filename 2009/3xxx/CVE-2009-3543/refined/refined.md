Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3543:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection flaw. This means that the application does not directly display the results of SQL queries, making it harder for attackers to see the data directly. Instead, attackers must infer results by observing the application's behavior, such as error messages or response times.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies within the `login.php` script of Phenotype CMS 2.8. The `user` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize or validate user input, allowing attackers to insert malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials (usernames and passwords) or other sensitive data. The impact of successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to the application, data breaches, and complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `login.php` script via the `user` parameter. The attacker crafts a malicious URL, embedding SQL injection payloads. For example, they insert SQL conditions like `... and ascii(substring((select user_login from user limit 1,1),1,1))=[ascii code try]/*`. The response will either display a login page (if the ASCII value is correct) or return a 500 Internal Server Error.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and needs knowledge of SQL and blind SQL injection techniques. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without prior authentication. The attacker does not need to have any special permissions within the application to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
- The application does not sanitize the user-provided 'user' parameter in the login.php script.
- The attacker can use boolean-based blind SQL injection to extract data from the database.
- This vulnerability exists in the admin panel of Phenotype CMS 2.8, but does not require an existing login to exploit.
- The attacker infers if their SQL injection was successful by observing the response from the server (either successful login page, or an Internal Server Error).
- The provided exploit uses the `ascii()` and `substring()` SQL functions to extract data character by character, by testing ASCII codes until the server's response indicates they found the correct character.

This information provides a good level of detail regarding the vulnerability and its potential impact.
