Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3970

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `aid` parameter of the PHP Dir Submit script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `aid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - **Data theft:** Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data.
    - **Privilege escalation:** Gaining administrative access to the database.
    - **Complete system takeover:** In some cases, this can lead to remote code execution and full control of the server.
- **Information disclosure:** Extracting database structure and contents, version information, and user information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted URL containing the malicious SQL injection payload in the `aid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious queries.
- **Account on the vulnerable system:** As indicated in the exploit steps, the attacker needs to have a registered account to post articles and then access the vulnerable code via the 'View Article' functionality.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific injection point is in the `index.php?menu=showarticle&aid=` parameter.
- The exploit example provided in the exploit database shows the use of a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract database information such as the version, user, and database names.
- The vulnerable application is identified as PHP Dir Submit version 1.00.

**Exploit Example:**
```
http://www.xxx.com/path/index.php?menu=showarticle&aid=3+and+1=0/**/union/**/select/**/1,version(),3,4,user(),database(),7,8,9,10,11--
```
This URL demonstrates how an attacker can use a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract version, user, and database information, after creating an account and posting an article.
