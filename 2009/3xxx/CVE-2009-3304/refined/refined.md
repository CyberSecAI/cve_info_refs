- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A symlink attack vulnerability exists in gforge, a collaborative development tool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to a symlink attack. This allows a malicious local user to create symbolic links that point to arbitrary files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user can exploit the symlink attack vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files on the system. This leads to a denial of service (DoS) by disrupting system functionality and potentially causing data loss.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning a user with local access to the system running gforge can exploit this.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user on the system running the vulnerable gforge instance.
