Subject: CVE request: kernel: issue with O_EXCL creates on NFSv4

There is an issue with O_EXCL creates on NFSv4 that with enough
attempts, it is possible for a lingering file from a failed create that
is world-writable but only setuid execute as the user who is attempting
these creates. Fortunately, root is not susceptible to this bug, so a
setuid root file should not be possible. It might be possible to exploit
this to gain access as another user though.

In-depth description/reproducer:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Files created by git have very odd metadata.  I managed to get files that looked like:  ----------. 1 paris paris 0 1970-05-27 18:50 .git/index.lock or like -r-s-wxr-- 1 paris paris 0 Jan 18  2038 .git/objects/tmp_obj_JVIlCu  Obviously the metadata is totally screwed up....  If i add 'nohide' to the export everything seems to be working correctly.  Something should be done to keep me from getting into this 'broken' situation...

When I actually mount 127.0.0.1 using NFSv4 even the nohide doesn't seem to fix the problem.....   [Comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c2) From  dijuremo (dijuremo)  2009-09-11 12:08:12 EDT   (-) [reply] [edit] -------      Private  I can confirm this same problem, I originally found the issue on my file servers serving nfs and samba along with drbd after updating to 5.4. It all seems related to the kernel 2.6.18-164.el5. Having all the rpms from 5.4 and using the older kernel 2.6.18-128.7.1.el5 fixed the problem, so this is most likely a kernel issue.  I actually kickstarted a new machine, configured it as an nfs server and was able to reproduce the problem.  I think the priority and severity of this request should be elevated to HIGH!!!

I do believe that the problem is related to O_EXCL flag to open(2). Try to run mktemp (user of open(2) with O_EXCL) and try to generate a temporary file on the filesystem. It seems that creating files without O_EXCL is ok.

We had some changes in that area in 5.4 ([bug 502244](show_bug.cgi?id=502244)) that may be at fault. Still trying to narrow down the exact problem at this point and how upstream kernels behave.

The client is then supposed to go back and reset those values with a SETATTR call if the create was successful.  What's happening here is that the inital create is occurring, but then the permission check for the open fails. This short-circuits the rest of the process, causes the open to return an error and leaves the inode in this funky state. That also explains why we don't see this problem with root...the permission check is always passing there (provided we're not root squashing).  The modes are a little disturbing too actually. I believe nfsd is generally passing an uninitialized value for the mode to the vfs_create call. In some cases, the mode just happens to end up allowing the permission check to pass. Those are shown by testfile_Lp7607 and testfile_EV7164 in the above list.  If this hypothesis is correct there are 2 possibilties for fixing it:  1) ensure that the create mode is set in such a way that the subsequent permission check succeeds  2) always allow the permission check to succeed in this case  It's not clear to me whether and how this was fixed upstream, so I may need to do some similar investigation there.    [Comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c8) From  Jeff Layton (jlayton)  2009-09-14 13:12:12 EDT   (-) [reply] [edit] -------      Private  So to be clear...while this is technically a regression from 5.3, I think the patch that went into 5.4 is actually correct and just ended up exposing another bug in this code.    [Comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c9) From  Jeff Layton (jlayton)  2009-09-14 15:34:43 EDT   (-) [reply] [edit] -------      Private  Ok, I see part of the problem...  In the nfsd4_open struct, the verifier and the iattrs are a union. For exclusive creates, the verifier field is intended to be used. For other creates, the iattr piece may be used.  The bogus modes come about because we're setting the verifier, and then later dereferencing the iattr part of that union. This gives us crazy ia_valid values and possibly modes as well...  This seems to have been inadvertantly fixed upstream as part of the NFSv4.1 code merge with commit 79fb54abd285b442e1f30f851902f3ddf58e7704. That patch separated the union into 2 fields for other reasons, but probably fixed this as well.  That should fix the bogus modes by making it so that the mode is set to S_IFREG on create. That will probably not completely fix the problem though...it will probably still fail the following permission check, but that should at least make things consistent.    [Comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c11) From  Jeff Layton (jlayton)  2009-09-15 09:13:10 EDT   (-) [reply] [edit] -------      Private  Created an attachment (id=361079) [details] patchset #2  This set of patches should be a complete fix. It includes the patch that I posted yesterday, plus two other patches. One is a cosmetic patch to clean up the indentation in do_open_lookup, and the other makes the permissions check conditional on whether the file was actually created.  All 3 patches are backports from upstream, and fix the reproducer I have for this. Working on building a test kernel now that I'll have up on my people page later today.

I'm not opposed to seeing this fix ship sooner, but in order for that to happen someone will need to open a support case and request a more immediate fix.

Locke (blocke)  2009-09-17 13:38:41 EDT   (-) [reply] [edit] -------      Private  I'm afraid I can't open a direct support case as we're using academic licensing and I'd rather chew off my arm then deal with our hardware vendor's support team.  What I can say is that I saw a related issue on our systems and the test kernel above fixes our issue.  We didn't notice the randomized permissions.  In our case many calls in java to java.io.UnixFileSystem.createFileExclusively failed and rolling the kernel back or using your test kernel fixes the issue.  In your example it shows a major security issue with DAC permissions being randomized with a good chance of a file being uploaded through a webapp being granted SUID and execute.  That isn't enough of a reason?  Thanks for all your efforts so far.

I'm going to see > what can be done to get it fixed sooner than 5.5. Stay tuned...    Isn't it obvious that anybody running nfs4 on RHEL 5.4 will have this problem? I guess that 5.4 being so new, it has not yet made it into big commercial installations as they seem to hold off updating, but this is just such a critical problem with a very commonly used service that as soon as the big companies start deploying 5.4 they are going to find themselves in a huge mess with all their nfs servers broken if this is not fixed. I guess at least we can run with your patched kernel -165, but that one is not really "official".  I have asked my campus fellows with support contracts to open tickets, add 1953460 and 1953404 to the list.

RH also just released another kernel the other day for a KVM issue, so it's not like they appear to be holding off for consolidation here.   Folks in this bug are actively vocal and generally appear to be paying customers given the quantity of support ticket numbers listed, so what's going on?   Could someone from RH explain what the delay is about? If there's a legitimate explanation then it should clear up some of the hostility floating around in this bug.   I'm not asking for a complete disclosure of practices, but a small peak behind the curtain would certainly go a long way to ease some of the tension here.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c13)  Ric Wheeler    2009-10-01 18:11:41 UTC  ``` As Jeff said in [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c10](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c10 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-3286 kernel: O_EXCL creates on NFSv4 are broken"), please open a specific ticket with Red Hat support if you want/need a hotfix before we do another minor release.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c14)  Jim Perrin    2009-10-01 18:40:17 UTC  ``` I have. Mine is the original paid support ticket listed in the post at the top. (original [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c22))  via paid support I was told November. I asked there why it was taking so long and was offered the hotfix early. That's great, but doesn't help other folks. I'm simply asking here why it's taking so long.   Would you like me to open a separate paid support ticket to ask why it taking 3 months and lots of pushing to get this fixed?  All I'm asking for is an explanation for the delay. I don't think that's asking for anything overly unreasonable.

This bug missed the cycle for the last monthly update.   This to me is a workable explanation that is a middle ground between inundating folks with new kernels and not releasing updates at all.

Jim, this bug was reported to us during the QE phase in the last kernel update, so we can only fix it in the next update. I could have explained this in the bug in response to c#5, but I was already on vacation then. Sorry about it. As mentioned in c#19, hotfixes are available, kindly contact Red Hat Support for them.

Yes, of course.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c28)  Mike Hanby    2009-10-27 17:49:39 UTC  ``` I'd like to add that I experienced the metadata issues on my 5.4 NFSv4 server (5.4 clients as well). In addition I also got a lot of reports from users where applications couldn't establish a file lock (/home is NFSv4 mounted):  $ ssh -X wkstation01 /usr/bin/xauth:  error in locking authority file /home/mhanby/.Xauthority  As suggested above, booting to kernel 2.6.18-128.7.1 appears to have resolved the issue.  I haven't tried the patched kernel yet.

Files created by git have very odd metadata.  I managed to get files that looked like:  ----------. 1 paris paris 0 1970-05-27 18:50 .git/index.lock or like -r-s-wxr-- 1 paris paris 0 Jan 18  2038 .git/objects/tmp_obj_JVIlCu  Obviously the metadata is totally screwed up....  If i add 'nohide' to the export everything seems to be working correctly.  Something should be done to keep me from getting into this 'broken' situation...

When I actually mount 127.0.0.1 using NFSv4 even the nohide doesn't seem to fix the problem.....   [Comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c2) From  dijuremo (dijuremo)  2009-09-11 12:08:12 EDT   (-) [reply] [edit] -------      Private  I can confirm this same problem, I originally found the issue on my file servers serving nfs and samba along with drbd after updating to 5.4. It all seems related to the kernel 2.6.18-164.el5. Having all the rpms from 5.4 and using the older kernel 2.6.18-128.7.1.el5 fixed the problem, so this is most likely a kernel issue.  I actually kickstarted a new machine, configured it as an nfs server and was able to reproduce the problem.  I think the priority and severity of this request should be elevated to HIGH!!!

I do believe that the problem is related to O_EXCL flag to open(2). Try to run mktemp (user of open(2) with O_EXCL) and try to generate a temporary file on the filesystem. It seems that creating files without O_EXCL is ok.

We had some changes in that area in 5.4 ([bug 502244](show_bug.cgi?id=502244)) that may be at fault. Still trying to narrow down the exact problem at this point and how upstream kernels behave.

The client is then supposed to go back and reset those values with a SETATTR call if the create was successful.  What's happening here is that the inital create is occurring, but then the permission check for the open fails. This short-circuits the rest of the process, causes the open to return an error and leaves the inode in this funky state. That also explains why we don't see this problem with root...the permission check is always passing there (provided we're not root squashing).  The modes are a little disturbing too actually. I believe nfsd is generally passing an uninitialized value for the mode to the vfs_create call. In some cases, the mode just happens to end up allowing the permission check to pass. Those are shown by testfile_Lp7607 and testfile_EV7164 in the above list.  If this hypothesis is correct there are 2 possibilties for fixing it:  1) ensure that the create mode is set in such a way that the subsequent permission check succeeds  2) always allow the permission check to succeed in this case  It's not clear to me whether and how this was fixed upstream, so I may need to do some similar investigation there.    [Comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c8) From  Jeff Layton (jlayton)  2009-09-14 13:12:12 EDT   (-) [reply] [edit] -------      Private  So to be clear...while this is technically a regression from 5.3, I think the patch that went into 5.4 is actually correct and just ended up exposing another bug in this code.    [Comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c9) From  Jeff Layton (jlayton)  2009-09-14 15:34:43 EDT   (-) [reply] [edit] -------      Private  Ok, I see part of the problem...  In the nfsd4_open struct, the verifier and the iattrs are a union. For exclusive creates, the verifier field is intended to be used. For other creates, the iattr piece may be used.  The bogus modes come about because we're setting the verifier, and then later dereferencing the iattr part of that union. This gives us crazy ia_valid values and possibly modes as well...  This seems to have been inadvertantly fixed upstream as part of the NFSv4.1 code merge with commit 79fb54abd285b442e1f30f851902f3ddf58e7704. That patch separated the union into 2 fields for other reasons, but probably fixed this as well.  That should fix the bogus modes by making it so that the mode is set to S_IFREG on create. That will probably not completely fix the problem though...it will probably still fail the following permission check, but that should at least make things consistent.    [Comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c11) From  Jeff Layton (jlayton)  2009-09-15 09:13:10 EDT   (-) [reply] [edit] -------      Private  Created an attachment (id=361079) [details] patchset #2  This set of patches should be a complete fix. It includes the patch that I posted yesterday, plus two other patches. One is a cosmetic patch to clean up the indentation in do_open_lookup, and the other makes the permissions check conditional on whether the file was actually created.  All 3 patches are backports from upstream, and fix the reproducer I have for this. Working on building a test kernel now that I'll have up on my people page later today.

Locke (blocke)  2009-09-17 13:38:41 EDT   (-) [reply] [edit] -------      Private  I'm afraid I can't open a direct support case as we're using academic licensing and I'd rather chew off my arm then deal with our hardware vendor's support team.  What I can say is that I saw a related issue on our systems and the test kernel above fixes our issue.  We didn't notice the randomized permissions.  In our case many calls in java to java.io.UnixFileSystem.createFileExclusively failed and rolling the kernel back or using your test kernel fixes the issue.  In your example it shows a major security issue with DAC permissions being randomized with a good chance of a file being uploaded through a webapp being granted SUID and execute.  That isn't enough of a reason?  Thanks for all your efforts so far.

I'm going to see > what can be done to get it fixed sooner than 5.5. Stay tuned...    Isn't it obvious that anybody running nfs4 on RHEL 5.4 will have this problem? I guess that 5.4 being so new, it has not yet made it into big commercial installations as they seem to hold off updating, but this is just such a critical problem with a very commonly used service that as soon as the big companies start deploying 5.4 they are going to find themselves in a huge mess with all their nfs servers broken if this is not fixed. I guess at least we can run with your patched kernel -165, but that one is not really "official".  I have asked my campus fellows with support contracts to open tickets, add 1953460 and 1953404 to the list.

RH also just released another kernel the other day for a KVM issue, so it's not like they appear to be holding off for consolidation here.   Folks in this bug are actively vocal and generally appear to be paying customers given the quantity of support ticket numbers listed, so what's going on?   Could someone from RH explain what the delay is about? If there's a legitimate explanation then it should clear up some of the hostility floating around in this bug.   I'm not asking for a complete disclosure of practices, but a small peak behind the curtain would certainly go a long way to ease some of the tension here.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c13)  Ric Wheeler    2009-10-01 18:11:41 UTC  ``` As Jeff said in [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c10](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c10 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-3286 kernel: O_EXCL creates on NFSv4 are broken"), please open a specific ticket with Red Hat support if you want/need a hotfix before we do another minor release.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c14)  Jim Perrin    2009-10-01 18:40:17 UTC  ``` I have.

I asked there why it was taking so long and was offered the hotfix early. That's great, but doesn't help other folks. I'm simply asking here why it's taking so long.   Would you like me to open a separate paid support ticket to ask why it taking 3 months and lots of pushing to get this fixed?  All I'm asking for is an explanation for the delay. I don't think that's asking for anything overly unreasonable.

This bug missed the cycle for the last monthly update.   This to me is a workable explanation that is a middle ground between inundating folks with new kernels and not releasing updates at all.

Jim, this bug was reported to us during the QE phase in the last kernel update, so we can only fix it in the next update. I could have explained this in the bug in response to c#5, but I was already on vacation then. Sorry about it. As mentioned in c#19, hotfixes are available, kindly contact Red Hat Support for them.

Yes, of course.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c28)  Mike Hanby    2009-10-27 17:49:39 UTC  ``` I'd like to add that I experienced the metadata issues on my 5.4 NFSv4 server (5.4 clients as well). In addition I also got a lot of reports from users where applications couldn't establish a file lock (/home is NFSv4 mounted):  $ ssh -X wkstation01 /usr/bin/xauth:  error in locking authority file /home/mhanby/.Xauthority  As suggested above, booting to kernel 2.6.18-128.7.1 appears to have resolved the issue.  I haven't tried the patched kernel yet. Just figured I'd add the locking issue in case someone searches for it since I did a good bit of searching before an IRC user directed me to this bug.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-03 19:33:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1548 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1548.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c33)  Rudd-O DragonFear    2010-08-04 08:53:32 UTC  ``` This problem happens in Fedora 13, kernel 2.6.33.6-147.2.4.fc13.x86_64 and earlier kernels, if the exported file system is a FUSE file system (REGARDLESS of the kernel in the exporter server) in NFS versions 2 and 3.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I should have been much more clear about the effects of this bug, and how to test it out.  What you are getting below is expected, but let me explain in more detail.  The fundamental problem that caused us to see this bug is that the HP serial console hardware on this type of machine is buggy.  In particular, it can get into a state where it won't timely drain the TX buffer.  That means that the operating system (in this case, the hypervisor + dom0) is filling up the serial TX buffer with data to send, but the serial hardware isn't picking that up and rendering it out to the IPMI in a timely manner.  Previous to this patch, when the TX buffer got full, the hypervisor would just hang until the buffer emptied.  This was not a good thing to do; we don't want to stop booting the machine just because we encountered buggy serial hardware.  You could tell that the whole machine was hung by the fact that ping and/or ssh into the machine failed.  After this patch, we *still* have the buggy serial hardware, but the machine finishes booting.  That means that the TX buffer fills up, the hardware fails to drain it, but instead of hanging, the hypervisor now just drops serial data.  This means that the machine can finish booting, even though we lose some serial data along the way.  You can tell that it finished booting by ssh'ing or ping'ing the machine, which still should be up.  So, I think that we have proved that the HP serial hardware is still buggy.  Assuming that we can ssh into the machine with the -164.6.1 kernel, even though we don't get all of the serial output, then I think that we've proved that this patch works.  I'm going to flip it back to ON_QA for the time being.  Chris Lalancette   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=524153#c19)  Vivian Bian    2009-11-03 09:24:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=524153#c18))    so the real problem to delay the verify process is the buggy serial console.   with both -164-6.1 kernel and -170 kernel, I could ping the HP host and ssh into it successfully when I got the hang output. So we can say the kernel is still booting at that point , and could boot successfully . Also I did removed the crontab after I ssh into the HP host , and could perform some commands successfully.    now set the status to VERIFIED   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=524153#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-03 19:34:19 UTC  ``` An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This kernel update for openSUSE 11.0 fixes some bugs and several
security problems.
The following security issues are fixed:
CVE-2009-4536: drivers/net/e1000/e1000\_main.c in the e1000 driver
in the Linux kernel handles Ethernet frames that exceed the MTU by
processing certain trailing payload data as if it were a complete
frame, which allows remote attackers to bypass packet filters via a
large packet with a crafted payload.
CVE-2009-4538: drivers/net/e1000e/netdev.c in the e1000e driver in
the Linux kernel does not properly check the size of an Ethernet
frame that exceeds the MTU, which allows remote attackers to have an
unspecified impact via crafted packets.
CVE-2010-0007: Missing CAP\_NET\_ADMIN checks in the ebtables netfilter
code might have allowed local attackers to modify bridge firewall
settings.
CVE-2010-0003: An information leakage on fatal signals on x86\_64
machines was fixed.
CVE-2009-4138: drivers/firewire/ohci.c in the Linux kernel, when
packet-per-buffer mode is used, allows local users to cause a denial
of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly
have unknown other impact via an unspecified ioctl associated with
receiving an ISO packet that contains zero in the payload-length field.
CVE-2009-4308: The ext4\_decode\_error function in fs/ext4/super.c
in the ext4 filesystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32 allows
user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference), and possibly have unspecified other impact,
via a crafted read-only filesystem that lacks a journal.
CVE-2009-3939: The poll\_mode\_io file for the megaraid\_sas driver in
the Linux kernel 2.6.31.6 and earlier has world-writable permissions,
which allows local users to change the I/O mode of the driver by
modifying this file.
CVE-2009-4021: The fuse\_direct\_io function in fs/fuse/file.c in the
fuse subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32-rc7 might allow
attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference
and OOPS) via vectors possibly related to a memory-consumption attack.
CVE-2009-3547: A race condition in the pipe(2) system call could be
used by local attackers to hang the machine. The kernel in Moblin
2.0 uses NULL ptr protection which avoids code execution possibilities.
CVE-2009-2903: Memory leak in the AppleTalk subsystem in the Linux
kernel 2.4.x through 2.4.37.6 and 2.6.x through 2.6.31, when the
AppleTalk and ipddp modules are loaded but the ipddp"N" device is
not found, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(memory consumption) via IP-DDP datagrams.
CVE-2009-3621: net/unix/af\_unix.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.31.4 and
earlier allows local users to cause a denial of service (system hang)
by creating an abstract-namespace AF\_UNIX listening socket, performing
a shutdown operation on this socket, and then performing a series of
connect operations to this socket.
CVE-2009-3612: The tcf\_fill\_node function in net/sched/cls\_api.c in
the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.32-rc5,
and 2.4.37.6 and earlier, does not initialize a certain tcm\_\_pad2
structure member, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive
information from kernel memory via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2009-3620: The ATI Rage 128 (aka r128) driver in the Linux kernel
before 2.6.31-git11 does not properly verify Concurrent Command Engine
(CCE) state initialization, which allows local users to cause a denial
of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly
gain privileges via unspecified ioctl calls.
CVE-2009-3726: The nfs4\_proc\_lock function in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c in
the NFSv4 client in the Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc4 allows remote
NFS servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
and panic) by sending a certain response containing incorrect file
attributes, which trigger attempted use of an open file that lacks
NFSv4 state.
CVE-2009-3286: NFSv4 in the Linux kernel 2.6.18, and possibly other
versions, does not properly clean up an inode when an O\_EXCL create
fails, which causes files to be created with insecure settings such
as setuid bits, and possibly allows local users to gain privileges,
related to the execution of the do\_open\_permission function even when
a create fails.
CVE-2009-2910: arch/x86/ia32/ia32entry.S in the Linux kernel before
2.6.31.4 on the x86\_64 platform does not clear certain kernel
registers before a return to user mode, which allows local users to
read register values from an earlier process by switching an ia32
process to 64-bit mode.
CVE-2009-3238: The get\_random\_int function in drivers/char/random.c
in the Linux kernel before 2.6.30 produces insufficiently random
numbers, which allows attackers to predict the return value, and
possibly defeat protection mechanisms based on randomization, via
vectors that leverage the function's tendency to "return the same
value over and over again for long stretches of time."
CVE-2009-2848: The execve function in the Linux kernel,
possibly 2.6.30-rc6 and earlier, does not properly clear the
current->clear\_child\_tid pointer, which allows local users to cause a
denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly gain privileges via
a clone system call with CLONE\_CHILD\_SETTID or CLONE\_CHILD\_CLEARTID
enabled, which is not properly handled during thread creation and exit.
CVE-2009-3002: The Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc7 does not initialize
certain data structures within getname functions, which allows
local users to read the contents of some kernel memory locations
by calling getsockname on (1) an AF\_APPLETALK socket, related to
the atalk\_getname function in net/appletalk/ddp.c; (2) an AF\_IRDA
socket, related to the irda\_getname function in net/irda/af\_irda.c;
(3) an AF\_ECONET socket, related to the econet\_getname function
in net/econet/af\_econet.c; (4) an AF\_NETROM socket, related to the
nr\_getname function in net/netrom/af\_netrom.c; (5) an AF\_ROSE socket,
related to the rose\_getname function in net/rose/af\_rose.c; or (6)
a raw CAN socket, related to the raw\_getname function in net/can/raw.c.
CVE-2009-1633: Multiple buffer overflows in the cifs subsystem
in the Linux kernel before 2.6.29.4 allow remote CIFS servers to
cause a denial of service (memory corruption) and possibly have
unspecified other impact via (1) a malformed Unicode string, related
to Unicode string area alignment in fs/cifs/sess.c; or (2) long Unicode
characters, related to fs/cifs/cifssmb.c and the cifs\_readdir function
in fs/cifs/readdir.c.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

## Details

Solar Designer discovered that the z90crypt driver did not correctly

check capabilities. A local attacker could exploit this to shut down

the device, leading to a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06.

([CVE-2009-1883](/security/CVE-2009-1883))

Michael Buesch discovered that the SGI GRU driver did not correctly check

the length when setting options. A local attacker could exploit this

to write to the kernel stack, leading to root privilege escalation or

a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2584](/security/CVE-2009-2584))

It was discovered that SELinux did not fully implement the mmap\_min\_addr

restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to allocate the

NULL memory page which could lead to further attacks against kernel

NULL-dereference vulnerabilities. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected.

([CVE-2009-2695](/security/CVE-2009-2695))

Cagri Coltekin discovered that the UDP stack did not correctly handle

certain flags. A local user could send specially crafted commands and

traffic to gain root privileges or crash the systeam, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06. ([CVE-2009-2698](/security/CVE-2009-2698))

Hiroshi Shimamoto discovered that monotonic timers did not correctly

validate parameters. A local user could make a specially crafted timer

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2767](/security/CVE-2009-2767))

Michael Buesch discovered that the HPPA ISA EEPROM driver did not

correctly validate positions. A local user could make a specially crafted

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2846](/security/CVE-2009-2846))

Ulrich Drepper discovered that kernel signal stacks were not being

correctly padded on 64-bit systems. A local attacker could send specially

crafted calls to expose 4 bytes of kernel stack memory, leading to a

loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-2847](/security/CVE-2009-2847))

Jens Rosenboom discovered that the clone method did not correctly clear

certain fields. A local attacker could exploit this to gain privileges

or crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-2848](/security/CVE-2009-2848))

It was discovered that the MD driver did not check certain sysfs files.

A local attacker with write access to /sys could exploit this to cause

a system crash, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 6.06 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-2849](/security/CVE-2009-2849))

Mark Smith discovered that the AppleTalk stack did not correctly

manage memory. A remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic

to cause the system to consume all available memory, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2903](/security/CVE-2009-2903))

Loïc Minier discovered that eCryptfs did not correctly handle writing

to certain deleted files. A local attacker could exploit this to gain

root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-2908](/security/CVE-2009-2908))

It was discovered that the LLC, AppleTalk, IR, EConet, Netrom, and

ROSE network stacks did not correctly initialize their data structures.

A local attacker could make specially crafted calls to read kernel memory,

leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3001](/security/CVE-2009-3001), [CVE-2009-3002](/security/CVE-2009-3002))

It was discovered that the randomization used for Address Space Layout

Randomization was predictable within a small window of time. A local

attacker could exploit this to leverage further attacks that require

knowledge of userspace memory layouts. ([CVE-2009-3238](/security/CVE-2009-3238))

Eric Paris discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly handle file creation

failures. An attacker with write access to an NFSv4 share could exploit

this to create files with arbitrary mode bits, leading to privilege

escalation or a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3286](/security/CVE-2009-3286))

Bob Tracy discovered that the SCSI generic driver did not correctly use

the right index for array access. A local attacker with write access

to a CDR could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 9.04 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3288](/security/CVE-2009-3288))

Jan Kiszka discovered that KVM did not correctly validate certain

hypercalls. A local unprivileged attacker in a virtual guest could exploit

this to crash the guest kernel, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu

6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3290](/security/CVE-2009-3290))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1548)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local

users in the unconfined\_t domain to map low memory areas even if the
mmap\_min\_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local
exploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the eCryptfs implementation

in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a local
denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2908, Important)

* a flaw was found in the NFSv4 implementation. The kernel would do an

unnecessary permission check after creating a file. This check would
usually fail and leave the file with the permission bits set to random
values. Note: This is a server-side only issue. (CVE-2009-3286, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux

kernel. pci\_unmap\_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
abuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.
(CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in the Linux kernel. Padding data

in several core network structures was not initialized properly before
being sent to user-space. These flaws could lead to information leaks.
(CVE-2009-3228, Moderate)

Bug fixes:

* with network bonding in the "balance-tlb" or "balance-alb" mode, the

primary setting for the primary slave device was lost when said device was
brought down. Bringing the slave back up did not restore the primary
setting. (BZ#517971)

* some faulty serial device hardware caused systems running the kernel-xen

kernel to take a very long time to boot. (BZ#524153)

* a caching bug in nfs\_readdir() may have caused NFS clients to see

duplicate files or not see all files in a directory. (BZ#526960)

* the RHSA-2009:1243 update removed the mpt\_msi\_enable option, preventing

certain scripts from running. This update adds the option back. (BZ#526963)

* an iptables rule with the recent module and a hit count value greater

than the ip\_pkt\_list\_tot parameter (the default is 20), did not have any
effect over packets, as the hit count could not be reached. (BZ#527434)

* a check has been added to the IPv4 code to make sure that rt is not NULL,

to help prevent future bugs in functions that call ip\_append\_data() from
being exploitable. (BZ#527436)

* a kernel panic occurred in certain conditions after reconfiguring a tape

drive's block size. (BZ#528133)

* when using the Linux Virtual Server (LVS) in a master and backup

configuration, and propagating active connections on the master to the
backup, the connection timeout value on the backup was hard-coded to 180
seconds, meaning connection information on the backup was soon lost. This
could prevent the successful failover of connections. The timeout value
can now be set via "ipvsadm --set". (BZ#528645)

* a bug in nfs4\_do\_open\_expired() could have caused the reclaimer thread on

an NFSv4 client to enter an infinite loop. (BZ#529162)

* MSI interrupts may not have been delivered for r8169 based network cards

that have MSI interrupts enabled. This bug only affected certain systems.
(BZ#529366)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Files created by git have very odd metadata.  I managed to get files that looked like:  ----------. 1 paris paris 0 1970-05-27 18:50 .git/index.lock or like -r-s-wxr-- 1 paris paris 0 Jan 18  2038 .git/objects/tmp_obj_JVIlCu  Obviously the metadata is totally screwed up....  If i add 'nohide' to the export everything seems to be working correctly.  Something should be done to keep me from getting into this 'broken' situation...

When I actually mount 127.0.0.1 using NFSv4 even the nohide doesn't seem to fix the problem.....   [Comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c2) From  dijuremo (dijuremo)  2009-09-11 12:08:12 EDT   (-) [reply] [edit] -------      Private  I can confirm this same problem, I originally found the issue on my file servers serving nfs and samba along with drbd after updating to 5.4. It all seems related to the kernel 2.6.18-164.el5. Having all the rpms from 5.4 and using the older kernel 2.6.18-128.7.1.el5 fixed the problem, so this is most likely a kernel issue.  I actually kickstarted a new machine, configured it as an nfs server and was able to reproduce the problem.  I think the priority and severity of this request should be elevated to HIGH!!!

The client is then supposed to go back and reset those values with a SETATTR call if the create was successful.  What's happening here is that the inital create is occurring, but then the permission check for the open fails. This short-circuits the rest of the process, causes the open to return an error and leaves the inode in this funky state. That also explains why we don't see this problem with root...the permission check is always passing there (provided we're not root squashing).  The modes are a little disturbing too actually. I believe nfsd is generally passing an uninitialized value for the mode to the vfs_create call. In some cases, the mode just happens to end up allowing the permission check to pass. Those are shown by testfile_Lp7607 and testfile_EV7164 in the above list.  If this hypothesis is correct there are 2 possibilties for fixing it:  1) ensure that the create mode is set in such a way that the subsequent permission check succeeds  2) always allow the permission check to succeed in this case  It's not clear to me whether and how this was fixed upstream, so I may need to do some similar investigation there.

[Comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c9) From  Jeff Layton (jlayton)  2009-09-14 15:34:43 EDT   (-) [reply] [edit] -------      Private  Ok, I see part of the problem...  In the nfsd4_open struct, the verifier and the iattrs are a union. For exclusive creates, the verifier field is intended to be used. For other creates, the iattr piece may be used.  The bogus modes come about because we're setting the verifier, and then later dereferencing the iattr part of that union. This gives us crazy ia_valid values and possibly modes as well...  This seems to have been inadvertantly fixed upstream as part of the NFSv4.1 code merge with commit 79fb54abd285b442e1f30f851902f3ddf58e7704. That patch separated the union into 2 fields for other reasons, but probably fixed this as well.  That should fix the bogus modes by making it so that the mode is set to S_IFREG on create. That will probably not completely fix the problem though...it will probably still fail the following permission check, but that should at least make things consistent.

In our case many calls in java to java.io.UnixFileSystem.createFileExclusively failed and rolling the kernel back or using your test kernel fixes the issue.

I guess that 5.4 being so new, it has not yet made it into big commercial installations as they seem to hold off updating, but this is just such a critical problem with a very commonly used service that as soon as the big companies start deploying 5.4 they are going to find themselves in a huge mess with all their nfs servers broken if this is not fixed.

I'm not asking for a complete disclosure of practices, but a small peak behind the curtain would certainly go a long way to ease some of the tension here.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c13)  Ric Wheeler    2009-10-01 18:11:41 UTC  ``` As Jeff said in [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c10](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c10 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-3286 kernel: O_EXCL creates on NFSv4 are broken"), please open a specific ticket with Red Hat support if you want/need a hotfix before we do another minor release.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c14)  Jim Perrin    2009-10-01 18:40:17 UTC  ``` I have. Mine is the original paid support ticket listed in the post at the top. (original [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c22))  via paid support I was told November. I asked there why it was taking so long and was offered the hotfix early. That's great, but doesn't help other folks. I'm simply asking here why it's taking so long.   Would you like me to open a separate paid support ticket to ask why it taking 3 months and lots of pushing to get this fixed?  All I'm asking for is an explanation for the delay. I don't think that's asking for anything overly unreasonable. As I said before, if there's a good reason it should allay the hostility that appears to be in this BZ entry.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c15)  dijuremo    2009-10-01 18:45:53 UTC  ``` We have also requested a hot fix via paid support and have not heard anything since Sep 23 as shown in our previous posting:  23-SEP-2009 16:17:50  **RH Support** I've requested the hotfix for you and will try to find out an ETA on when it could be fulfilled.  Regards, **RH Support**   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c16)  Levente Farkas    2009-10-01 18:48:04 UTC  ``` many of us already open a ticket. and we just waiting. in most other case rh can release a kernel update in a much faster way, but as most of us don't understand how can it happened that such a basic service bug not fixed for months?   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c19)  dijuremo    2009-10-02 12:12:34 UTC  ``` The following hotfix packages have been made available to us via our support ticket:  kernel-2.6.18-164.3.1.el5.x86_64.rpm kernel-2.6.18-164.3.1.el5.i686.rpm  If you have a support contract I assume you can get those as well until everyone gets the patched kernel in the first week of November.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c20)  Jim Perrin    2009-10-02 22:01:34 UTC  ``` Via paid support, the word I got on the delay was that they were going to release a roll-up kernel to fix this and several other issues, and that they try to do this monthly. This bug missed the cycle for the last monthly update.   This to me is a workable explanation that is a middle ground between inundating folks with new kernels and not releasing updates at all. Given that the hotfix is available for those who request it, I'm satisfied with this explanation.   No idea why this couldn't have been explained here in the BZ though.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c21)  Jeff Layton    2009-10-08 18:34:12 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 523797](show_bug.cgi?id=523797 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - RHEL5.4 kernel (2.6.18-164.el5) breaks nfsv4 file locking") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c23)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-10-13 01:34:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c20)) > Via paid support, the word I got on the delay was that they were going to > release a roll-up kernel to fix this and several other issues, and that they > try to do this monthly.

Jim, this bug was reported to us during the QE phase in the last kernel update, so we can only fix it in the next update. I could have explained this in the bug in response to c#5, but I was already on vacation then. Sorry about it. As mentioned in c#19, hotfixes are available, kindly contact Red Hat Support for them. Thanks.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c24)  Levente Farkas    2009-10-14 08:50:08 UTC  ``` can we know the the hotfix mentioned in #13 and the coming kernel update in november will contain the same patch as attached in #2? thanks.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c25)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-10-14 09:02:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #24](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c24)) > can we know the the hotfix mentioned in #13 and the coming kernel update in > november will contain the same patch as attached in #2? > thanks.    Yes, of course.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c28)  Mike Hanby    2009-10-27 17:49:39 UTC  ``` I'd like to add that I experienced the metadata issues on my 5.4 NFSv4 server (5.4 clients as well). In addition I also got a lot of reports from users where applications couldn't establish a file lock (/home is NFSv4 mounted):  $ ssh -X wkstation01 /usr/bin/xauth:  error in locking authority file /home/mhanby/.Xauthority  As suggested above, booting to kernel 2.6.18-128.7.1 appears to have resolved the issue.  I haven't tried the patched kernel yet. Just figured I'd add the locking issue in case someone searches for it since I did a good bit of searching before an IRC user directed me to this bug.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-03 19:33:38 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1548 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1548.html>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c33)  Rudd-O DragonFear    2010-08-04 08:53:32 UTC  ``` This problem happens in Fedora 13, kernel 2.6.33.6-147.2.4.fc13.x86_64 and earlier kernels, if the exported file system is a FUSE file system (REGARDLESS of the kernel in the exporter server) in NFS versions 2 and 3.

If you can provide the steps to reproduce the issue, even better. Thanks.   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c38)  Jeff Layton    2010-08-05 11:59:25 UTC  ``` This bug was due to a bug introduced in a backport to RHEL5. It should be a problem only in a small subset of RHEL5 kernels and was fixed quite some time ago. I suspect that any problems in Fedora are unrelated to this, even if the symptoms look the same.   ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=524520#c39)  Rudd-O DragonFear    2010-08-06 05:43:27 UTC  ``` OK.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
