| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=529137#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-10-15 05:57:18 UTC  ``` Description of problem: (description copied from [bug 515857](show_bug.cgi?id=515857)).  The hardware condition is the same as [bz504732](show_bug.cgi?id=504732) described: 2 machines and a switch supporting jumbo frames(actually we didn't use a switch but a coaxial-cable). The pingee has a rtl8169 NIC.  I configure MTU of both machine, the pinger is set to 9000 and the pingee is set to 7200.  Then I execute flood ping from the pinger to pingee by execute ping -f -s 3000 <pingee's IP>, few seconds later the pingee crashed.  Crash doesn't occur when using ping -f <pingee's IP> (i.e. don't send large packets).  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  rhel-5.4 with kernel-2.6.18-160.el5  How reproducible:  as described above.  Actual results:  few seconds after executing ping -f -s 3000, the pingee gives out the error message, then crashes:  PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0 PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0 <Repeated Many Many Times> PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0 PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0  HARDWARE ERROR CPU 0: Machine Check Exception:                7 Bank 4: bc0000000005001b RIP 10:<ffffffff8006b2b0> {default_idle+0x29/0x50} TSC 10116da2355 ADDR 4000000 MISC c008000001000000  This is not a software problem! Run through mcelog --ascii to decode and contact your hardware vendor Kernel panic - not syncing: Uncorrected machine check  <7>APIC error on CPU2: 00(08)  the pinger prints dots on screen(since no reply received) repeatedly.  Expected results:  the pingee doesn't crash, or the pingee refuses the flood ping(since flood ping usually used as a kind of DoS attack).

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update fixes a several security issues and various bugs in the
SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP 2 kernel.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2009-3939: A sysctl variable of the megaraid\_sas driver was
world writable, allowing local users to cause a denial of service
or potential code execution.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.6 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-4005: The collect\_rx\_frame function in
drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc\_usb.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32-rc7
allows attackers to have an unspecified impact via a crafted HDLC
packet that arrives over ISDN and triggers a buffer under-read.
This requires the attacker to be ISDN link-local.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.2 (HIGH) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3080: A negative offset in a ioctl in the GDTH RAID driver
was fixed.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.2 (HIGH) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-4021: The fuse\_direct\_io function in fs/fuse/file.c in the
fuse subsystem in the Linux kernel might allow attackers to cause a
denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and OOPS) via vectors
possibly related to a memory-consumption attack.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3889: The dbg\_lvl file for the megaraid\_sas driver in the
Linux kernel before 2.6.27 has world-writable permissions, which
allows local users to change the (1) behavior and (2) logging level
of the driver by modifying this file.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.6 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
CVE-2009-2903: Memory leak in the AppleTalk subsystem in the Linux
kernel when the AppleTalk and ipddp modules are loaded but the ipddp"N"
device is not found, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory consumption) via IP-DDP datagrams.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.1 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3621: net/unix/af\_unix.c in the Linux kernel allows local
users to cause a denial of service (system hang) by creating an
abstract-namespace AF\_UNIX listening socket, performing a shutdown
operation on this socket, and then performing a series of connect
operations to this socket.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3612 / CVE-2005-4881: The tcf\_fill\_node function in
net/sched/cls\_api.c in the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.x
before 2.6.32-rc5, and 2.4.37.6 and earlier, does not initialize a
certain tcm\_\_pad2 structure member, which might allow local users
to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via unspecified
vectors. NOTE: this issue existed because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2005-4881.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N)
CVE-2009-3620: The ATI Rage 128 (aka r128) driver in the Linux
kernel does not properly verify Concurrent Command Engine (CCE)
state initialization, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly gain
privileges via unspecified ioctl calls.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3726: The nfs4\_proc\_lock function in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c
in the NFSv4 client in the Linux kernel allows remote NFS servers
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic)
by sending a certain response containing incorrect file attributes,
which trigger attempted use of an open file that lacks NFSv4 state.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.8 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3613: The swiotlb functionality in the r8169 driver in
drivers/net/r8169.c in the Linux kernel allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (IOMMU space exhaustion and system crash)
by using jumbo frames for a large amount of network traffic, as
demonstrated by a flood ping.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.8 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
The rio and sx serial multi port card drivers were disabled via a
modprobe blacklist due to severe bugs.
For a full list of changes, please read the RPM changelog.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=9468#c0)  Alistair Strachan    2007-11-28 13:43:47 UTC  ``` (Shameless repost from my mail to LKML. Seems to have gone quiet so I thought I wouldn't let this bugger get lost.)  I have recently assembled a Core 2 Duo system with 4GB RAM and I believe there  might be a bug in the r8169 driver in >4GB RAM configurations.  Initially I can use one of two active r8169 NICs on the motherboard with this  quantity of RAM with other devices, without issue. But after some amount of  data (generally about 50MB), no more network packets are sent/received.  The "choke" affects other devices on the system too, notably libata, which  does not recover gracefully. In my logs, I see a stream of:  DMA: Out of SW-IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:04:00.0 DMA: Out of SW-IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:04:00.0  The device 0000:04:00.0 corresponds to one of the r8169s.  The reason I believe r8169 is at fault is that I was doing a rebuild of my  RAID5 across 3 SATA drives via libata's ahci driver, and transferring over the  network. When the "choke" occurred the RAID sync stopped, libata errors were  seen, and I simply did a "ifconfig br0 down" (which contained the r8169) and  the messages went away. Bringing the NIC up again would see some initial  functionality then very rapidly it would go back to the same error messages.  The Intel chipset I am using does not support any kind of hardware IOMMU, so I  am forced to use swiotlb in a 4GB RAM configuration. In an attempt to delay  the failures, I used the swiotlb option to increase the swiotlb's page  allocation with "swiotlb=65536" (which seems to correspond to a 256MB bounce  buffer).  Assuming both libata and r8169 use the swiotlb, and both systems are impaired  when these messages appear, removing r8169 would appear to be key. Indeed, if  there is no significant libata activity, the problem still occurs on the NIC  within approximately the same amount of transfer.  This option delays the failure for some time but it will happen eventually,  which makes me suspicious that maybe the driver is somehow pinning an area of  the buffer and not releasing it. (I hunted bugzilla for reports similar to  this one, but couldn't find anything.)  Having tested the r8169 driver on an AMD system I did not experience the same  problems with 4GB RAM, so this could be a bug specific to swiotlb. I would  have added more people to CC but I have no idea who might be responsible.  mem=2000M on the cmdline works around this issue. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=9468#c1)  Alistair Strachan    2008-03-12 17:31:27 UTC  ``` No change with 2.6.25-rc5. Disabling the IOMMU still works around the problem (albeit at the loss of half my RAM). ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=9468#c2)  Alistair Strachan    2008-05-17 10:39:38 UTC  ``` Still a problem with 2.6.26-rc2. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=9468#c3)  Branko Badrljica    2008-06-11 15:17:33 UTC  ``` Same here with 2.6.25-r4 ( gentoo-sources) but on the different system -AMD Phenom with 4GB RAM.  Interesting things are:  If I take out phenom 9850 and plug in X2 6000+, IOMMU error vanishes and system works perfectly normally  - on Phenom workaround is to use smaller MTU. I had mtu 7200 which was pro9blematic, so I have lowered it. It seems that anything up to 3600 works fine for me, but I use 2048 just to be sure.... ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=9468#c4)  Alistair Strachan    2008-06-11 15:35:32 UTC  ``` As I tried to explain in my original report, my problem is with the swiotlb support, NOT the AMD hardware IOMMU. My Intel chipset does not support any hardware IOMMU. Unless you're explicitly disabling GART IOMMU on AMD, I can't imagine your problem is the same as mine.  Of course, it would be really interesting if it were. Do you see exactly the same messages? Could I see your dmesg?  Other posters have mentioned the lower MTU, but I still have problems (packet loss, unreliability) even at 1500, it just won't crash the machine (but who knows, maybe it just takes 5-6 times longer to do so). ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=9468#c5)  Francois Romieu    2008-08-20 14:49:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 17344](attachment.cgi?id=17344 "pci_unmap unbalance") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=17344&action=edit "pci_unmap unbalance") pci_unmap unbalance  Alistair, can you give the attached patch a try agaisnt 2.6.27-rc ?  --  Ueimor ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=9468#c6)  Alistair Strachan    2008-08-20 15:32:45 UTC  ``` Thanks a LOT. This patch seems to fix the issue completely and I'm running with my swiotlb once again in 2.6.27-rc3. Transferred >4GB data over the link with 7.2k frames, which is the most I've ever been able to do with the r8169 driver + Intel + 4GB RAM, no warnings to dmesg.  I think you've plugged this particular leak. Well done!  Tested-by: Alistair John Strachan <alistair@devzero.co.uk> ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=9468#c7)  Adrian Bunk    2008-08-28 13:15:58 UTC  ``` fixed by commit a866bbf6aacf95f849810079442a20be118ce905 ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=9468#c8)  4hya    2011-07-14 04:51:54 UTC  ``` how would I use this patch for linux mint 11 x64? ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=9468#c9)  Francois Romieu    2011-07-14 08:00:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=9468#c8)) > how would I use this patch for linux mint 11 x64 ?  Your distribution claims to be 2.6.38 based. If so the patch is already included in it.  Please contact your distribution vendor.  --  Ueimor ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=529597#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-10-19 04:52:04 UTC  ``` Quoting from the upstream commit: Almost all r128's private ioctls require that the CCE state has already been initialised.  However, most do not test that this has been done, and will proceed to dereference a null pointer.  This may result in a security vulnerability, since some ioctls are unprivileged.  This adds a macro for the common initialisation test and changes all ioctl implementations that require prior initialisation to use that macro.  Also, r128_do_init_cce() does not test that the CCE state has not been initialised already.  Repeated initialisation may lead to a crash or resource leak.  This adds that test.  <http://git.kernel.org/linus/7dc482dfeeeefcfd000d4271c4626937406756d7>  Other references: <http://secunia.com/advisories/36707/>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=529597#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-03 18:21:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2009:1540 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1540.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=529597#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-05 05:14:49 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.27.38-170.2.113.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/kernel-2.6.27.38-170.2.113.fc10>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=529597#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-06 00:05:05 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.27.38-170.2.113.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=529137#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-10-15 05:57:18 UTC  ``` Description of problem: (description copied from [bug 515857](show_bug.cgi?id=515857)).  The hardware condition is the same as [bz504732](show_bug.cgi?id=504732) described: 2 machines and a switch supporting jumbo frames(actually we didn't use a switch but a coaxial-cable). The pingee has a rtl8169 NIC.  I configure MTU of both machine, the pinger is set to 9000 and the pingee is set to 7200.  Then I execute flood ping from the pinger to pingee by execute ping -f -s 3000 <pingee's IP>, few seconds later the pingee crashed.  Crash doesn't occur when using ping -f <pingee's IP> (i.e. don't send large packets).  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  rhel-5.4 with kernel-2.6.18-160.el5  How reproducible:  as described above.  Actual results:  few seconds after executing ping -f -s 3000, the pingee gives out the error message, then crashes:  PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0 PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0 <Repeated Many Many Times> PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0 PCI-DMA: Out of IOMMU space for 7222 bytes at device 0000:03:00.0  HARDWARE ERROR CPU 0: Machine Check Exception:                7 Bank 4: bc0000000005001b RIP 10:<ffffffff8006b2b0> {default_idle+0x29/0x50} TSC 10116da2355 ADDR 4000000 MISC c008000001000000  This is not a software problem! Run through mcelog --ascii to decode and contact your hardware vendor Kernel panic - not syncing: Uncorrected machine check  <7>APIC error on CPU2: 00(08)  the pinger prints dots on screen(since no reply received) repeatedly.  Expected results:  the pingee doesn't crash, or the pingee refuses the flood ping(since flood ping usually used as a kind of DoS attack).

## Details

It was discovered that the AX.25 network subsystem did not correctly

check integer signedness in certain setsockopt calls. A local attacker

could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

Ubuntu 9.10 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-2909](/security/CVE-2009-2909))

Jan Beulich discovered that the kernel could leak register contents to

32-bit processes that were switched to 64-bit mode. A local attacker

could run a specially crafted binary to read register values from an

earlier process, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-2910](/security/CVE-2009-2910))

Dave Jones discovered that the gdth SCSI driver did not correctly validate

array indexes in certain ioctl calls. A local attacker could exploit

this to crash the system or gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2009-3080](/security/CVE-2009-3080))

Eric Dumazet and Jiri Pirko discovered that the TC and CLS subsystems

would leak kernel memory via uninitialized structure members. A local

attacker could exploit this to read several bytes of kernel memory,

leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3228](/security/CVE-2009-3228), [CVE-2009-3612](/security/CVE-2009-3612))

Earl Chew discovered race conditions in pipe handling. A local attacker

could exploit anonymous pipes via /proc/\*/fd/ and crash the system or

gain root privileges. ([CVE-2009-3547](/security/CVE-2009-3547))

Dave Jones and Francois Romieu discovered that the r8169 network driver

could be made to leak kernel memory. A remote attacker could send a large

number of jumbo frames until the system memory was exhausted, leading

to a denial of service. Ubuntu 9.10 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3613](/security/CVE-2009-3613)).

Ben Hutchings discovered that the ATI Rage 128 video driver did not

correctly validate initialization states. A local attacker could

make specially crafted ioctl calls to crash the system or gain root

privileges. ([CVE-2009-3620](/security/CVE-2009-3620))

Tomoki Sekiyama discovered that Unix sockets did not correctly verify

namespaces. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a system hang,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-3621](/security/CVE-2009-3621))

J. Bruce Fields discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly use the credential

cache. A local attacker using a mount with AUTH\_NULL authentication

could exploit this to crash the system or gain root privileges. Only

Ubuntu 9.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3623](/security/CVE-2009-3623))

Alexander Zangerl discovered that the kernel keyring did not correctly

reference count. A local attacker could issue a series of specially

crafted keyring calls to crash the system or gain root privileges.

Only Ubuntu 9.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3624](/security/CVE-2009-3624))

David Wagner discovered that KVM did not correctly bounds-check CPUID

entries. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system

or possibly gain elevated privileges. Ubuntu 6.06 and 9.10 were not

affected. ([CVE-2009-3638](/security/CVE-2009-3638))

Avi Kivity discovered that KVM did not correctly check privileges when

accessing debug registers. A local attacker could exploit this to

crash a host system from within a guest system, leading to a denial of

service. Ubuntu 6.06 and 9.10 were not affected. ([CVE-2009-3722](/security/CVE-2009-3722))

Philip Reisner discovered that the connector layer for uvesafb, pohmelfs,

dst, and dm did not correctly check capabilties. A local attacker could

exploit this to crash the system or gain elevated privileges. Ubuntu

6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3725](/security/CVE-2009-3725))

Trond Myklebust discovered that NFSv4 clients did not robustly

verify attributes. A malicious remote NFSv4 server could exploit

this to crash a client or gain root privileges. Ubuntu 9.10 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-3726](/security/CVE-2009-3726))

Robin Getz discovered that NOMMU systems did not correctly validate

NULL pointers in do\_mmap\_pgoff calls. A local attacker could attempt to

allocate large amounts of memory to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 6.06 and 9.10 were affected. ([CVE-2009-3888](/security/CVE-2009-3888))

Joseph Malicki discovered that the MegaRAID SAS driver had

world-writable option files. A local attacker could exploit these

to disrupt the behavior of the controller, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2009-3889](/security/CVE-2009-3889), [CVE-2009-3939](/security/CVE-2009-3939))

Roel Kluin discovered that the Hisax ISDN driver did not correctly

check the size of packets. A remote attacker could send specially

crafted packets to cause a system crash, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2009-4005](/security/CVE-2009-4005))

Lennert Buytenhek discovered that certain 802.11 states were not handled

correctly. A physically-proximate remote attacker could send specially

crafted wireless traffic that would crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 9.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-4026](/security/CVE-2009-4026), [CVE-2009-4027](/security/CVE-2009-4027))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change (except for Ubuntu 6.06)

the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires

you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you

might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to

update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel

version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system

upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1548)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local

users in the unconfined\_t domain to map low memory areas even if the
mmap\_min\_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local
exploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the eCryptfs implementation

in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a local
denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2908, Important)

* a flaw was found in the NFSv4 implementation. The kernel would do an

unnecessary permission check after creating a file. This check would
usually fail and leave the file with the permission bits set to random
values. Note: This is a server-side only issue. (CVE-2009-3286, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux

kernel. pci\_unmap\_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
abuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.
(CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in the Linux kernel. Padding data

in several core network structures was not initialized properly before
being sent to user-space. These flaws could lead to information leaks.
(CVE-2009-3228, Moderate)

Bug fixes:

* with network bonding in the "balance-tlb" or "balance-alb" mode, the

primary setting for the primary slave device was lost when said device was
brought down. Bringing the slave back up did not restore the primary
setting. (BZ#517971)

* some faulty serial device hardware caused systems running the kernel-xen

kernel to take a very long time to boot. (BZ#524153)

* a caching bug in nfs\_readdir() may have caused NFS clients to see

duplicate files or not see all files in a directory. (BZ#526960)

* the RHSA-2009:1243 update removed the mpt\_msi\_enable option, preventing

certain scripts from running. This update adds the option back. (BZ#526963)

* an iptables rule with the recent module and a hit count value greater

than the ip\_pkt\_list\_tot parameter (the default is 20), did not have any
effect over packets, as the hit count could not be reached. (BZ#527434)

* a check has been added to the IPv4 code to make sure that rt is not NULL,

to help prevent future bugs in functions that call ip\_append\_data() from
being exploitable. (BZ#527436)

* a kernel panic occurred in certain conditions after reconfiguring a tape

drive's block size. (BZ#528133)

* when using the Linux Virtual Server (LVS) in a master and backup

configuration, and propagating active connections on the master to the
backup, the connection timeout value on the backup was hard-coded to 180
seconds, meaning connection information on the backup was soon lost. This
could prevent the successful failover of connections. The timeout value
can now be set via "ipvsadm --set". (BZ#528645)

* a bug in nfs4\_do\_open\_expired() could have caused the reclaimer thread on

an NFSv4 client to enter an infinite loop. (BZ#529162)

* MSI interrupts may not have been delivered for r8169 based network cards

that have MSI interrupts enabled. This bug only affected certain systems.
(BZ#529366)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2009:1540 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2009-11-03
Updated:
2009-11-03
# RHSA-2009:1540 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix several security issues, multiple bugs,
and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.1.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* the ADDR\_COMPAT\_LAYOUT and MMAP\_PAGE\_ZERO flags were not cleared when a

setuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to bypass the mmap\_min\_addr protection mechanism and perform a
NULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)

* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local

users in the unconfined\_t domain to map low memory areas even if the
mmap\_min\_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local
exploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in getname() implementations in

numerous network protocol implementations in the Linux kernel. Certain
data structures in these getname() implementations were not initialized
properly before being copied to user-space. These flaws could lead to an
information leak. (CVE-2009-3002, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux

kernel. pci\_unmap\_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
abuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.
(CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the r128 driver in the

Linux kernel. Checks to test if the Concurrent Command Engine state was
initialized were missing in private IOCTL functions. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a local denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2009-3620, Important)

* Kees Cook and Steve Beattie discovered a race condition in the /proc

code in the Linux kernel. This could lead to information in the
"/proc/[pid]/maps" and "/proc/[pid]/smaps" files being leaked to users (who
would otherwise not have access to this information) during ELF loading.
This could help a local attacker bypass the ASLR security feature.
(CVE-2009-2691, Moderate)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the md driver in the Linux

kernel. If the suspend\_lo or suspend\_hi file in "/sys/" is modified when
the disk array is inactive, it could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. By default, only root can write to these two files.
(CVE-2009-2849, Moderate)

* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,

32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. (CVE-2009-2910, Moderate)

* padding data in several core network structures was not initialized

properly before being sent to user-space, possibly leading to information
leaks. (CVE-2009-3228, CVE-2009-3612, Moderate)

* the unix\_stream\_connect() function in the Linux kernel did not check if a

UNIX domain socket was in the shutdown state. This could lead to a
deadlock. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2009-3621, Moderate)

These updated packages also include bug fixes and enhancements. Users are
directed to the Realtime Security Update Release Notes for version 1.1 for
information on these changes, which will be available shortly from:

<http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_MRG/>

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues and add enhancements. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>
