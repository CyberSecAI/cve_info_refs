{
  "CVE-2009-3613": {
    "description": "The swiotlb functionality in the r8169 driver in drivers/net/r8169.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.27.22 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (IOMMU space exhaustion and system crash) by using jumbo frames for a large amount of network traffic, as demonstrated by a flood ping.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A memory leak in the `r8169` driver's `pci_unmap_single()` function, which could lead to IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) space exhaustion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The swiotlb (software IOMMU translation lookaside buffer) functionality in the r8169 driver is vulnerable.",
        "Improper handling of DMA mappings during flood ping attacks with large MTU settings.",
        "Lack of proper resource management and cleanup in the r8169 driver.",
	"Insufficient checks and validation of MTU settings and packet sizes."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service on the target system by exhausting IOMMU space, leading to system crash and panic.",
      "attack_vector": "Remote network attack using flood ping with large MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) settings.",
	 "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable host. They need to be on the same network segment or have routing access to the victim. They need to be able to send network packets of configurable sizes."
