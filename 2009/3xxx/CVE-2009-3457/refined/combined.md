Eye diseases and complications can diminish your vision and even result in total eye loss. Eye doctors often recommend that you treat eye problems as soon as possible to avoid further complications and even vision loss and blindness. While many people have a personal or family [eye doctors in Pembroke Pines](https://www.elitevisioncenters.com/) to call their own and handle their general health issues, not many people have a personal eye doctor to diagnose and treat eye diseases. There are several of them to choose from, which can be very overwhelming if you do not know what to look for. Finding an eye doctor is similar to finding a family physician or doctor. Below are tips for identifying the best eye doctor.

**Understand the Specializations**

Understanding the specializations is the first step toward selecting the best doctor. It is important to know that there are several sub-specializations even within this field. For instance, ophthalmologists and optometrists care for the eye, but there are subtle differences between them. Optometrists perform general eye care, including diagnosis and treatment, eye exam, vision test, and lenses, contacts, and frames. In contrast, ophthalmologists handle the more technical aspects of eye care, including surgery and treatment of more serious eye diseases. Optometrists will often refer you to ophthalmologists in the event that they diagnose you with a more serious eye condition.

**Ask your physician or doctor for recommendations**

Doctors or physicians tend to work with other specialists and refer clients or patients to each other. In fact, this is an excellent way to find a competent eye doctor. Physicians and doctors frequently refer patients to different specialists and know some of the best in town. They will tell you who to go to and who to avoid when having a medical complication that requires the attention of a specialist. In addition, you have worked with your physician and hold their opinions in high regard.

**Ask for referrals from colleagues, neighbors, friends, and family**

If any of your colleagues, neighbors, friends or family has experienced eye problems before, there are chances they visited a good optometrist. Getting a patient’s perspective or view from people you already know and trust and have been to an optometrist can be very assuring. Unlike getting referrals from a family doctor, you will also get additional information about whether the optometrist and other members of staff are friendly and treat patients with dignity and respect. You will also get to know how they handle concerns. Other pieces of information that can be important include the cleanliness and modernity of the facilities, as well as the quality of care provided.

**Research the eye doctor’s qualifications**

The doctor’s credentials can give you an idea of the quality of care they give. You should find out whether they are licensed by the relevant state licensing bodies to practice in the field. You can also check their online ratings and reviews to find out how good they are at what they do.  The Better Business Bureau is a great place to start.

**How is their insurance policy?**

You should find out beforehand if they will accept the medical insurance you have. Some optometrists do not accept insurance covers from certain insurance providers.

While finding an optometrist can be difficult, doing your due diligence and asking for referrals from your doctor and friends can help find the best one. Just don’t be too overwhelmed by the number of eye specialists out there.

## Common Eye Diseases

[06/22/201906/22/2019](https://brainoverflow.org/common-eye-diseases/) [Brain Overflow](https://brainoverflow.org/author/bivbv5bzdh/)[Eye Diseases](https://brainoverflow.org/category/eye-diseases/)

Many Americans are unaware of the signs of common eye diseases. However, this does not change the fact that eye diseases are common and a major concern in the country. Many people are worried that they could one day lose their sight and become unable to see, but a few actually take the initiative to go for regular eye exams to ensure eye problems are detected and treated early before they become a major problem. Below are some of the most common eye diseases you should be on the lookout for, including their symptoms.

![](http://brainoverflow.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/eye-diseases-1024x683.jpg)
### **1. Glaucoma**

Glaucoma never fails to be mentioned among the most widespread eye conditions. It refers to a collection of eye diseases brought about by elevated intraocular pressure building up in the eye. The optic nerve is often affected by the build-up of pressure inside the eye and may result in vision loss. Open-angle glaucoma is more common and often painless whereas angle-closure glaucoma is less common and suddenly appears without warning and is commonly associated with eye pain and redness. The early phases tend to show no symptoms and by the time your vision is affected, it is often somewhat too late, as the damage is often permanent. Some of the treatments to slow down the progression of the disease include eye drops, laser treatments, and sometimes surgery. Therefore, doctors often encourage patients to go for early diagnosis. Risk factors include age and a family history of glaucoma. In addition, African Americans are also encouraged to go for frequent eye exams, as they are at a higher risk of contracting the disease.

### **2. Cataracts**

Cataracts are also some of the most common eye problems that people are likely to encounter in their lifetime. They are painless cloudy lenses that result in blurry vision. They are common among the elderly because they progress with age, as living longer increases the chances of having cataract changes to the eye’s cornea. Diabetes, some medications, and trauma can cause them. People are also advised to reduce their exposure to UV light. [A regular eye exam](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/what-to-expect-checkup-eye-exam-adults#1) can reveal a cataract. Some of the treatment options include magnifying lenses, eyeglasses, and sometimes surgery. A surgical procedure involves the removal of the cloudy lens and replacing it with a good artificial one.

### **3. AMD**

Age-related macular degeneration is also among the most common eye issues affecting the elderly. Those over the age of 60 years are at a higher risk of contracting the disease and it progressively destroys the patient’s macula, which is located at the center of the retina. Since the center of vision tends to be the only place affected, AMD rarely results in total blindness. Wet and dry AMD are the major subcategories of AMD.

### **4. Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)**

This is characterized by eye redness and inflammation of the conjunctiva. A viral or bacterial infection may cause this eye problem, but eye irritants like pollutants, allergens, or chemicals can also lead to the condition. Washing the hands frequently can reduce the spread of infections.

### **5. Uveitis**

This occurs when the uvea is having some inflammations. Infections, trauma, and injury to the eye can cause uveitis. A painful eyeball could signal uveitis, but other symptoms may include light sensitivity and blurred vision. Treatments include antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drops.

Glaucoma, uveitis, conjunctivitis, AMD, and cataracts are some of the eye diseases commonly experienced by patients. A regular eye checkup could lead to early diagnosis and treatment.

## Training to Become an Optometrist

[06/18/201906/18/2019](https://brainoverflow.org/training-to-become-an-optometrist/) [Brain Overflow](https://brainoverflow.org/author/bivbv5bzdh/)[Eye Care](https://brainoverflow.org/category/eye-care/)

![optometrist](http://brainoverflow.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/optometrist-1024x576.jpg)

Following a career path that leads to a life of fulfillment and stability is the best thing all human beings would want for themselves. There are several different specializations in the field of medicine and being an optometrist is one of them. Life as an optometrist can be very rewarding because today a large number of people wear some form of corrective lenses or facing a number of eye problems and need a specialist to help them correct their eyesight and treat their eye problems. Optometrists provide professional vision care to people with vision problems and in turn get attractive financial rewards. Here is what you should know if you are training to become an optometrist.

#### **Education Requirements**

If you are aspiring to be an optometrist, you need to pursue an education in the field and acquire a Bachelor’s Degree, which takes four years. The four-year degree is often in biology, physiology, or any other field related to optometry. With a Bachelor’s Degree, you are eligible to enroll for an optometry program. The first degree allows you to apply for admission, which may be accepted or rejected depending on whether you have met the requirements stipulated by the school or learning institution. In fact, many optometry programs in the country can be very selective when it comes to selecting and accepting applicants. Therefore, it is very important to earn exemplary grades in your undergraduate program so that you can increase your chances of getting selected to pursue optometry.

#### **State Licensing Requirements**

To practice optometry, you have to join a professional optometry board within your state. Each state entrusts a given optometry board within the state with the work of licensing all of its professional optometrists. However, all these state boards from different states fall under the national umbrella board, the “National Board of Examiners in Optometry”. You will have to pass a comprehensive examination that comprises of three parts as required by your state. Candidates are graded and awarded a pass or a fail. These examinations have additional parts that may differ depending on the state. These exams may be oral, written, or practical. [Optometrists have to undergo extensive testing sessions](https://americanboardofoptometry.org/board-certification/candidate-guide/licensure-status-requirement/) before they are licensed to practice. However, the requirements often differ and you should check with your state before proceeding accordingly. In addition, license renewals are required from time to time and may differ from one state to another. If you fail to meet some of these minimum requirements to allow you to practice as an optometrist may lead to revocation of your license.

#### **Potential Salary**

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that an optometrist earns an average salary of about $114, 260 per year. Therefore, it seems to be a lucrative career for someone looking for a rewarding career with handsome rewards. This means that on average an optometrist makes about $55 dollars an hour. However, these figures may vary from state to state, although optometrists earn a steady 2.5% increase annually to support their career growth.

Doctors of optometry or optometrists are majorly defined by what they do, which is ideally diagnosing and treating eye diseases, including eyeglass prescription. They provide highly specialized vision care, including eye examinations, prescribing corrective lenses, and treating simple eye diseases. However, complex eye diseases that require complex treatments and surgeries are often treated by ophthalmologists. If you are training to become an optometrist, you should be aware of what it takes to become a licensed optometrist. Also, do check with your state to ensure you meet the minimum requirements.

## The Latest Eye Care Technology You Should Know About

[06/14/201906/14/2019](https://brainoverflow.org/the-latest-eye-care-technology-you-should-know-about/) [Brain Overflow](https://brainoverflow.org/author/bivbv5bzdh/)[Eye Care Technology](https://brainoverflow.org/category/eye-care-technology/)

![](http://brainoverflow.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/eye-technology-1024x613.jpg)

New technological innovations are coming up often and constantly changing the way eye care is delivered. This is to mean that technology is always advancing and changing the way various medical procedures and processes are done. From simple eye exams to complex surgical procedures, everything seems to be improving to change the world of eye care and medicine for the better. It does not take long before we hear of a new test or piece of medical equipment to help improve eye care. If you have taken a long time before having your optometrist perform a comprehensive eye exam, you might be surprised to see some of the latest developments in eye care technology. Below are some of the latest developments you should watch out for what you next visit your optometrist or ophthalmologist.

#### **1. LASIK**

This is not very new to people who have been going for eye exams or have ended up in the eye doctor’s office because of eye complications. This procedure is used to reshape the cornea so that the eye’s focusing power is altered.

#### **2. iStent, ExpRESS shunt, selective laser trabeculoplasty**

Rather than using the customary eye drops for lowering intraocular pressure, there are several new procedures available for glaucoma patients. In addition, they can be used as front-line treatments

#### **3. Argon or Diode laser**

This technology applies lasers to help treat patients with retinal tears. It works by applying the laser to scar the patient’s retina, thereby allowing it to bind to the eye’s underlying tissue, thereby preventing further retinal detachment.

#### **4. Wavefront analysis**

It involves the measurement of how the patient’s eye focuses light and is very effective in creating an eye map to allow the ophthalmologist to diagnose eye issues. Your eye specialist can also use this technology to determine the most [appropriate eyeglass prescription](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/how-read-eye-glass-prescription) for you.

#### **5. Femtosecond laser**

While lasers need not be used when performing cataract surgeries, this technology is incredibly precise when it comes to such procedures. It is also safe and efficient.

There are several forms of eye care technologies that can be used to treat patients with eye problems. Welcoming new technology to the world of medicine is always exciting, but the latest procedures often attract some added costs because developing any new technology or enhancing an old one is always costly. However, it is also important to note that the newest and most expensive method does not always mean the best service. You need to keep your options open when seeking eye treatments because an old technology may cost less and still be as effective as the new one. In addition, stay in touch with your eye doctor for recommendations regarding the best and most effective procedures that do not cost much. If you go for eye exams on a regular basis, you might just save yourself thousands of dollars in treatment costs for complicated eye diseases that might have been treated before reaching advanced stages.

## Eye drops: What type is appropriate for your eye condition?

[05/31/201905/31/2019](https://brainoverflow.org/eye-drops-what-type-is-appropriate-for-your-eye-condition/) [Brain Overflow](https://brainoverflow.org/author/bivbv5bzdh/)[Eye Care](https://brainoverflow.org/category/eye-care/)

![](http://brainoverflow.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/eye-drops-1024x819.jpg)

Eye drops contain saline and administered via the ocular route. These eye drops may contain steroids, sympathomimetics, parasympathomimetics, prostaglandins, antibiotics, topical, antihistamines, beta receptor blockers, parasympatholytics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or antifungal substances, depending on the symptoms or condition of the eyes.

Some types of eye drops do not contain medication; these types function as tear-replacing and lubricating solutions. Eye drops only have minor side effects or risks compared to oral medications. However, if significant side effects are present, applying mild pressure on the inner corner of the eyes will help minimize these effects. You can also use eye drops for redness and itchiness.

**Types and uses of eye drops**

Eye drops are classified (depending on the active substances it contains) into [different pharmacological classes](https://www.verywellhealth.com/drug-classes-1123991) and used by different patients with varying conditions. Some of the most common eye drops and their functions are listed below.

1. Eye drops for dry eyes or artificial tears are used as tear-replacing and lubricating solutions. This type is widely available and can provide instant relief from dryness and irritation. Artificial tears can also minimize irritation, particularly in allergic conjunctivitis.
2. Glaucoma eye drops are used for glaucoma management. It can drain eye fluid and decrease its production; it also lowers eye pressure. This type of eye drops is classified based on the active ingredients they contain. Examples of these active ingredients are carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, beta blockers, prostaglandin analogs, and alpha agonists. If you require multiple medications, you might want to consider drugs that work well in combination.
3. Antibiotic and steroid eye drops are effective against eye infections. These have prophylactic properties and are commonly used after eye surgery. Pink eye antibiotic drops are prescribed if the patient has conjunctivitis due to bacteria. A doctor’s prescription must be followed accordingly without any interruption. Completing the prescribed course of antibiotics is essential. You may experience relapses if you discontinue the medication before the prescribed duration of treatment.
4. Allergy eye drops contain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or histamine antagonists that suppress the responses of the optical mast cell. Mast cells are critical players in allergic reactions. Allergens such as aerosolized dust particles can activate these mast cells which leads to allergic reaction symptoms, including red and watery eyes, as well as itchiness.
5. Mydriatic eye drops help widen the pupils of the eyes (dilation of the pupils), thereby allowing the optometrist to have the best internal view of the eyes, most especially behind the iris. During sunny weather, mydriatic may cause photophobia.

Side effects

Prostaglandin analogs in eye drops can cause changes in the eyelid skin and iris color. Stinging, eye redness, blurred vision, burning, and itching may also develop as side effects. Beta-blockers can cause a reduction in pulse rate, decreased blood pressure, fatigue, depression, shortness of breath, and reduced libido. You must see a physician immediately if you experience side effects.

Eye drops come in various forms and can be used for different eye conditions. You must consult with your doctor before you start using any kind of eye drops.

Vulnerability Information
=======================================
Product:        Cisco ACE XML Gateway <= 6.0
Vulnerabily:    Internal IP Address Disclosure
Vendor:         Cisco Systems, Inc. <http://www.cisco.com>
Product URL:    <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps7314/>
Author:         nitrØus  [ Alejandro Hernandez H. ]
Discovery Date: 24/Aug/2009
Attack Vector:  Remote
CVSS v2 Base Score: 5 (Medium) [ AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N ]
Class:          I think, it's a Design problem on the error messages' handling

Product Information
=======================================
The Cisco ACE XML Gateway is a key component of the Cisco Application Control
Engine (ACE) family of products. It brings application intelligence into the
network and enables efficient deployment of secure, reliable, and accelerated
Web service environments based on XML (Extensible Markup Language) and SOAP
(Simple Object Access Protocol) using a shared network infrastructure.

The ACE XML Gateway helps you to secure, manage, monitor, and accelerate an SOA.
In a service-oriented environment, the ACE XML Gateway acts as a service
virtualization layer. It decouples service providers from consumers, increasing
the stability, maintainability, and flexibility of those services. It enforces
security policies and applies business rules, such as routing decisions and
content validation processing, across message traffic in the environment.

The ACE XML Gateway secures your SOA implementation by providing advanced XML
firewall capabilities, with built-in protection against XML-based attacks,
such as SQL injection or entity expansion attacks, content screening capabilities
and more.

With a high-performance, streaming XML processing engine, the ACE XML Gateway
reduces the performance impact of XML traffic on the network.

Vulnerability Explaination
=======================================
Let's wait for the Cisco response, so, we'll have a better understanding on this
issue. Meanwhile...

I think this is a design error because ACE XML doesn't have in mind that the
client could probably be in the same network segment internally, so, it receives
the request, which cannot be processed, and throws an error message disclosing
an internal IP address.

According to the ACE XML Gateway User Guide, Log Messages chapter, the listed
error messages belong to different categories such as Alerts, Startup, Operational
and Policy Errors, so, I'm assuming that the OPTIONS HTTP method doesn't fit in
none of the mentioned categories, resulting in a message explaining that there's
no handler for this type of request which discloses an internal IP address.

Cisco PSIRT (Product Security Incident Response Team) responded by saying that the
bug is triggered not only by the OPTIONS request. Internal IP address is included
in response if ACE XML Gateway was not able to find a matching handler for the
request. Also, the PSIRT verified that GET request, with a path for which no
handler was configured, results in the same address disclosure.

Again, I think it's a design error because it wasn't taken into account that the
error message would disclose an internal IP address from the internal network.
