Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2009-3457:

**CVE-2009-3457** relates to an internal IP address disclosure vulnerability in the Cisco ACE XML Gateway <= 6.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a design flaw in how the Cisco ACE XML Gateway handles error messages. When a request is received for which no handler is configured (e.g., an OPTIONS request or a GET request with an invalid path), the gateway responds with an error message that includes the internal IP address of the device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Internal IP Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the device's internal IP address in the error response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can learn the internal IP address of the Cisco ACE XML Gateway device. This information can be used to map the internal network, and potentially launch further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted HTTP requests to the device.
-   The specific method is sending HTTP OPTIONS or GET requests with invalid paths or methods that are not handled by the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Cisco ACE XML Gateway. This could be from the same internal network or potentially from an external network if the device is exposed.
-   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details**
-   The vulnerability is triggered when the ACE XML Gateway cannot find a matching handler for a request.
-   The issue is not limited to OPTIONS requests, as GET requests with invalid paths can also trigger it.
-   Cisco PSIRT confirmed the vulnerability, and a fix was planned for version 6.1.
-   A proof-of-concept exploit code (Perl) was made available showing how an attacker can send crafted requests and extract internal IPs.
