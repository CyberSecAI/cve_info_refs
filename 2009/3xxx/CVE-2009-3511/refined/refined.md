Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `fs_jVroot` parameter in various PHP files of justVisual 1.2 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). This means the application doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input provided to this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes external files specified through the vulnerable `fs_jVroot` parameter without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include a malicious script from a remote server, which will then be executed on the server hosting the vulnerable justVisual application. This allows the attacker to potentially gain complete control over the server, execute arbitrary commands, access sensitive data, and more.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP GET requests, where the attacker manipulates the `fs_jVroot` parameter to point to a malicious script hosted on a remote server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable justVisual application.
*   **Remote Server:** The attacker must have a server where they host a malicious script that can be included via the RFI vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple PHP files within the application, including `index.php`, `contact.php`, `pageTemplate.php`, and `utilities.php`, all located within the `justVisual` directory.
*   The exploit examples provide URLs demonstrating how an attacker would inject a remote script using the `fs_jVroot` parameter, using null byte injection `%00` to bypass file extensions checks.
