Debian Security Advisory DSA-1886-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
September 14, 2009                    <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1310 CVE-2009-3079

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceweasel web
browser, an unbranded version of the Firefox browser. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-3079

   "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that a programming error in the FeedWriter
   module could lead to the execution of Javascript code with elevated
   privileges.

CVE-2009-1310

   Prateek Saxena discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
   the MozSearch plugin interface.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.6-3.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.14-1.

For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=454363#c0)• 16 years ago |
|  | |

This is the same issue as [bug 352124](/show_bug.cgi?id=352124 "RESOLVED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution using FeedWriter object").
onPageChanged() method accepts an untrusted JS object as aURI, thus, it's
possible to run arbitrary code with chrome privileges in the same way as bug
352124.
fx2 is not affected, since only trunk and fx3.0.x have onPageChanged() method.

Aren't there other issues lurking here? For example, in observe() we have:
if (topic == "nsPref:changed") {
Won't that call toString() on topic if topic is an object?

Could you actually pass a native object that implements (explicitly or implicitly) nsIPrefBranch2 and still be an untrusted caller?

Why does it need to implement nsIPrefBranch2? You're not ensuring that. You're just ensuring it's a real XPCOM object. I could pass a DOM node for |subject|, say. It wouldn't have any of the prefbranch properties on it, but you don't check for those or anything.
And even if you did, if someone happens to hand a prefbranch to content code it could then pass it to you with its objects of choice for the other args.

I can't see how a fix for this sg:critical bug can safely land in time for an Oct 24 code-freeze so we're going to have to bump this to the next release.

Is there a bug on rewriting the parser (or the Feed Preview UI) that explains what, precisely, about it is causing this class of security problem and what needs to be done?
You find yourself with a willing product driver, who shares your frustration and empathizes with your plight. He is unwilling to remove the component within a release (and so, whack-a-mole it will be) but is willing to do what he can to stop this class of attack in future versions of Firefox.

The testcase no longer works, presumably because [bug 352124](/show_bug.cgi?id=352124 "RESOLVED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution using FeedWriter object") was fixed, which makes this a bit hard to verify.
Do we need to worry about nsIClassInfo? GetInterfaces takes an aValue parameter and gets .value off of it, and xpconnect seems to allow my custom object with a .value getter. Was worried about the same being possible with QI, but it seems to check for valid IID objects (not sure whether there's a way around that).

trunk+1.9.1 patch (depends on the js bug)
This is sufficient to fix all the cases apart from my concern in the second paragraph of [comment 29](/show_bug.cgi?id=454363#c29 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution using FeedWriter.onPageChanged() method"), but since partial fixes don't really get us much, r- until we figure that out.

moz\_bug\_r\_a4, it would be useful if you could provide a testcase that doesn't rely on 352124 (i.e. that works on current trunk or 1.9.1 branch).Whiteboard: [sg:critical][needs review mconnor] → [sg:critical]

The testcase in this bug doesn't rely on [bug 352124](/show_bug.cgi?id=352124 "RESOLVED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution using FeedWriter object"). The reason the testcase
no longer works is that [attachment 343055](/attachment.cgi?id=343055 "patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=343055&action=edit "patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=343055&action=diff "patch") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=454363&attachment=343055) has already landed (see [comment #26](/show_bug.cgi?id=454363#c26 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution using FeedWriter.onPageChanged() method")).
fw.getInterfaces() seems to be safe.
function x() {
o = { set value() { ... } };
fw.getInterfaces(o);
}
In FW\_getInterfaces(), countRef is not o itself, and thus the o.value setter is
not called in FW\_getInterfaces(). It seems that xpconnect calls the o.value
setter after returning FW\_getInterfaces(). When the o.value setter is called,
caller is |function getInterfaces() {[native code]}| and caller.caller is x().
Hmm, when JS calls fw.observe(subject, topic, data), it seems that xpconnect
calls topic.toString() and data.toString() before entering FW\_observe(). Is
this right? If so, [attachment 343055](/attachment.cgi?id=343055 "patch") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=343055&action=edit "patch") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=343055&action=diff "patch") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=454363&attachment=343055) should be a sufficient patch.

Er, sorry - I meant "that does not depend on [bug 344495](/show_bug.cgi?id=344495 "VERIFIED FIXED - XSS against certain sites that are using scripts that access properties of top, parent or opener")", per [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=454363#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Arbitrary code execution using FeedWriter.onPageChanged() method"). Is that bug no longer relevant?
I'd like to better understand whether getInterfaces needs similar protection, but I think that might require feedback from someone who's more familiar with the wrapper situation. Blake?

I suppose it's possible to alter content's toString as well?

 // nsIObserver
observe: function FW\_observe(subject, topic, data) {
dump("in FW\_observe()\n");
dump("subject: " + typeof subject + " " + subject + "\n");
dump("topic: " + typeof topic + " " + topic + "\n");
dump("data: " + typeof data + " " + data + "\n");
// see init()
subject = new XPCNativeWrapper(subject);
Even when content calls fw.observe({}, {}, {}), at this point, topic and data
are already string primitives. Content's toString does not affect it.
I can pass an untrusted object as |subject| to FW\_observe(), but I can't think
of a way to pass objects as topic/data to FW\_observe(). Am I missing
something?

Yes. Note that I filed [bug 480205](/show_bug.cgi?id=480205 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement a wrapper for exposing chrome objects to content") on tracking the work being done for the wrapper. This way we can use these other bugs for whack-a-mole patches if we need to.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-51

## Chrome privilege escalation with FeedWriter

Announced
September 9, 2009
Reporter
moz\_bug\_r\_a4
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.14
* Firefox 3.5.3

### Description

Mozilla security researcher **moz\_bug\_r\_a4** reported
that the `BrowserFeedWriter` could be leveraged to run
JavaScript code from web content with elevated privileges. Using this
vulnerability, an attacker could construct an object containing
malicious JavaScript and cause the FeedWriter to process the object,
running the malicious code with chrome privileges.

Thunderbird does not support
the `BrowserFeedWriter` object and is not vulnerable in its
default configuration. Thunderbird might be vulnerable if the user has
installed any add-on which adds a similarly implemented feature and
then enables JavaScript in mail messages. This is not the default
setting and we strongly discourage users from running JavaScript in
mail.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing this fix can be
installed.
