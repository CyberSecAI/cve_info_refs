Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-3079:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A programming error exists within the FeedWriter module of Firefox. Specifically, the `onPageChanged()` method of the `FeedWriter` object accepted untrusted JavaScript objects as a URI, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute JavaScript code with elevated (chrome) privileges. This bypasses the normal security restrictions that prevent web content from accessing sensitive browser functionalities.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The `onPageChanged()` method did not properly validate or sanitize the input it received. This allowed malicious JavaScript code to be injected and executed.
- **Lack of Object Wrapping:** The FeedWriter was not properly wrapping objects passed to it, allowing potentially dangerous operations to be performed on them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code within the browser with chrome privileges, effectively gaining full control over the browser instance.
- **Data Theft:** With chrome privileges, attackers could steal sensitive user information, like browsing history, saved passwords, and cookies.
- **System Compromise:** In some cases, code execution within a browser could be used as a stepping stone to gain further access to a user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Content:** The attack vector is through web content. An attacker would need to get a user to visit a malicious page containing code designed to exploit the FeedWriter vulnerability.
- **Exploiting `onPageChanged()`:** The attack relied on the ability to pass a malicious object to the `FeedWriter.onPageChanged()` method, which would then execute the embedded JavaScript with elevated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Website Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a webpage that contains the malicious javascript to trigger this vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting the malicious page, possibly through phishing or drive-by attacks.
- **JavaScript Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be proficient in JavaScript to create the malicious payload and bypass any protection mechanisms.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was present in Firefox 3.0.x and later, but not in Firefox 2.x, as the `onPageChanged()` method was introduced in Firefox 3.0.
- The vulnerability is similar to a previous bug (bug 352124).
- It was initially thought that the fix for bug 479560 (CVE-2009-1841) would fix this issue, however, that only addressed a different attack vector exploiting the sidebar.
- A patch was developed and eventually applied to the 1.9.0 branch (Firefox 3.0.x), 1.9.1 branch (Firefox 3.5.x), and the trunk (development) branch.
- The bug report also highlights that there was discussion on potentially disabling the feeds feature due to ongoing security issues, indicating the underlying complexity of the feed handling system.

In summary, CVE-2009-3079 was a critical vulnerability that allowed for arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges in Firefox due to the improper handling of JavaScript objects within the `FeedWriter` module. This was a remote vulnerability that could be exploited by malicious web content, making it a serious threat at the time.
