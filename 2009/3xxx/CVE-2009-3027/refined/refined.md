For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |\n| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of multiple Symantec products. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the VRTSweb.exe Web Server component which listens by default on TCP ports 8181, 8443, and 14300. The process fails to properly validate an authentication request made to port 14300. By providing a specific request an attacker can bypass the authentication and instruct the process to unpack and execute data within an arbitrary WAR file. This can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user. |\n| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
