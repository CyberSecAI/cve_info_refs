How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Updated Capture File Support

ERF

## Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
the [download
page](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html) on the main web site.

### Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages
can be found on the
[download page](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html#otherplat) on the Wireshark web site.

## File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.

## Known Problems

Wireshark may appear offscreen on multi-monitor Windows systems.
([Bug
553](http://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=553))

Wireshark might make your system disassociate from a wireless network
on OS X.
([Bug
1315](http://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1315))

Dumpcap might not quit if Wireshark or TShark crashes.
([Bug
1419](http://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1419))

The BER dissector might infinitely loop.
([Bug
1516](http://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1516))

Wireshark can't dynamically update the packet list. This means that host
name resolutions above a certain response time threshold won't show up in
the packet list.
([Bug
1605](http://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1605))

Capture filters aren't applied when capturing from named pipes.
([Bug
1814](http://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1814))

Wireshark might freeze when reading from a pipe.
([Bug
2082](http://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2082))

Filtering tshark captures with display filters (-R) no longer works.
([Bug
2234](http://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2234))

The 64-bit Windows installer does not ship with the same libraries as the
32-bit installer.

## wnpa-sec-2009-06 · Multiple vulnerabilities in Wireshark

## Summary

**Name:** Multiple vulnerabilities in Wireshark

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2009-06

**Date:** September 15, 2009

**Affected versions:** 0.99.6 up to and including
1.2.1

**Fixed versions:** 1.2.2

## Details

### Description

Wireshark 1.2.2 fixes the following vulnerabilities:

* The GSM A RR dissector could crash.

  ([Bug
  3893](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3893))

  Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.1
  * The OpcUa dissector could use excessive CPU and memory.

    ([Bug
    3986](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3986))

    Versions affected: 0.99.6 to 1.0.8, 1.2.0 to 1.2.1
    * The TLS dissector could crash on some platforms.

      ([Bug
      4008](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4008))

      Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.1

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crash remotely or by convincing
someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.2.2 or later.

If are running Wireshark {{ end\_version }} or earlier (including Ethereal)
and cannot upgrade, you can work around each of the problems listed above by
doing the following:

* Disable the affected dissectors:
  + Select *Analyze→Enabled Protocols...* from the menu.+ Make sure "GSM CCCH", "OpcUa", and "SSL" are all un-checked.+ Click "Save", then click "OK".

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
