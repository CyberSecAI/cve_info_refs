Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3882:

**Summary:**

CVE-2009-3882 is related to information leaks within the OpenJDK, specifically due to static security flaws found in Swing. This is one of the multiple vulnerabilities addressed in Sun Java updates, which also included fixes for issues in image processing, font handling, and certificate validation.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in static security flaws within the Swing component of OpenJDK. The specific nature of the flaws are not detailed, but they involve mutable variables. The issue was identified via findbugs, a static analysis tool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Leak:** The vulnerability allows for the potential exposure of sensitive information due to the improper handling of mutable static variables within the Swing framework.
*   **Static Security Flaws:** These are flaws that can be found through static code analysis, indicating that the code structure itself had inherent weaknesses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data by exploiting the information leak. The exact nature of leaked information depends on the variables exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the Swing component. Exploitation could occur through malicious Java applications or applets that utilize the affected Swing classes.
*   Specific vectors of exploitation are not fully detailed in this document, but would likely involve the manipulation of swing components that utilize these mutable variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to execute malicious Java code (e.g., through a crafted JAR archive, applet, or Java Web Start application) on the victim's machine.
*   User interaction may be required to run the malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than a basic CVE description, which is noted as "placeholder".
*   The identified issues were addressed by implementing defensive coding modifications and hardening the affected areas of the source code.
*   The vulnerability is linked to a cluster of other Java vulnerabilities addressed in the same updates, suggesting a broad review of the codebase during this period.
*   The bug report mentions CVE-2009-3883 as well, which also concerns mutable statics in Windows PL&F and is related to the same set of fixes, though its analysis is separate.
*   The fix was deployed across multiple platforms and included in Red Hat Errata.
