{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure cookie handling",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application uses a client-side cookie to manage authentication, specifically the 'adminLoggedIn' cookie. It does not properly validate or secure this cookie on the server side.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain administrative access to the application by simply setting the 'adminLoggedIn' cookie to 'true' via client-side JavaScript. This bypasses the intended authentication mechanism.",
  "Attack vectors": "Client-side manipulation of cookies using JavaScript.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript within the context of the user's browser when interacting with the vulnerable website. This could be achieved through a crafted link, a malicious website, or by modifying HTTP response data. The attacker does not need any privileged access to the server to exploit this vulnerability."
