CVE-2009-3636:
Root cause: The TYPO3 Install Tool does not properly sanitize URL parameters.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the Install Tool, potentially leading to various actions depending on the user's permissions and the attacker's goals.
Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL with unsanitized parameters.
Required attacker capabilities/position: No specific position is mentioned other than the ability to craft a malicious URL. The install tool is not meant to be activated in production environments, but the exploit still exists.
