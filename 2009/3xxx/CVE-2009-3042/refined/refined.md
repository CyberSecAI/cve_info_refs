Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3042:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `machine.php` script of OCS Inventory NG Server 1.2.1.
- The script directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$systemid`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of a SQL injection flaw.  By manipulating the `systemid` parameter in the `machine.php` URL, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query executed against the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, password hashes, version information, and other potentially sensitive data.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can lead to further compromise, such as potentially modifying data, or using the database server as a stepping stone for other attacks depending on the privileges of the database user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `machine.php` script. Specifically, manipulating the `systemid` parameter of the URL.
- **Example Attack URL**: `http://localhost/ocsreports/machine.php?systemid=1)%20union%20select%201,2,user(),3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,passwd,14,15,16,17,18,id,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,27,version()%20from%20operators%20--`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the OCS Inventory NG Server to exploit this vulnerability. This implies that the attacker would need valid credentials.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the OCS Inventory NG Server.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is located in `machine.php`, specifically around line 77:
   ```php
   77 $queryMachine    = "SELECT * FROM hardware WHERE (ID=$systemid)";
   78 $result   = mysql_query( $queryMachine, $_SESSION["readServer"] ) or mysql_error($_SESSION["readServer"]);
   79 $item     = mysql_fetch_object($result);
   ```
- The lack of sanitization of the `$systemid` variable before being incorporated in the SQL query is the root cause.
