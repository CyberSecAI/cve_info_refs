Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3150

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` file of the Multi Website 1.5 application, specifically when handling the `action` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where unsanitized user input is directly incorporated into SQL queries. The vulnerable parameter is `action` and `Browse`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to the attacker gaining access to sensitive information stored in the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
  - **Data Manipulation:** The attacker might be able to modify or delete data from the database.
  - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, successful SQL injection can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, although this is not explicitly mentioned, it's a common consequence.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request with the vulnerable `action` and `Browse` parameters. The specific example provided is: `www.target.com/[path]/?action=vote&Browse=-1+union+select+1,@@version--`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
  - **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand how SQL injection works.

**Additional Notes:**
  - The provided exploit example uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract the database version, which is a common technique to test for SQL injection and gather information about the database.
  - The vulnerability is specific to Multi Website version 1.5
  - The exploit information suggests that a live demo was present at `http://www.multi-website.com/demo/?action=vote&Browse=-1+union+select+1,@@version--`, at the time of discovery.
  - No specific solution or patch is mentioned.
