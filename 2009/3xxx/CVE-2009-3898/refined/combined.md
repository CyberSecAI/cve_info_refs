How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Let's use CVE-2009-3898 for this one:

CVE-2009-3898

nginx versions before 0.8.17 and 0.7.63 contain a directory traversal flaw in
the webdav component. A user who can COPY or MOVE permissions could place
files outside the webdav root.

We'll use the same ID. mod_ssl did a similar thing and used CVE-2009-3555. I
think multiple IDs in this instance would actually create more confusion that
it would solve.

Thanks.

   I still haven't seen a CVE id for this (pls correct me
if I overlooked it). Could one be assigned? (if there isn't one yet).

Also not sure, if this one has been already addressed upstream?
(as there has been couple of more important Nginx security issues
  recently).

Igor, could you comment on upstream status of this one? Is there
a patch handy?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

Subject: CVEs for nginx

Hi,

are the CVEs for

1.) nginx webdav: <http://secunia.com/advisories/36818/>

2.) nginx Null Pointer dereference:
<http://sysoev.ru/nginx/patch.null.pointer.txt>

3.) nginx SSL Renegotiation: <http://sysoev.ru/nginx/patch.cve-2009-3555.txt>

I know the last one contains a CVE number, nginx uses openssl and the
patch will disable renegotiation, maybe this deserves an own CVE?

Best regards,

Craig

# nginx: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-22**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in nginx, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/nginx** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.14** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.14** |

### Background

nginx is a robust, small, and high performance HTTP and reverse proxy
server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in nginx:

* The TLS protocol does not properly handle session renegotiation
  requests (CVE-2009-3555).
* The "ngx\_http\_process\_request\_headers()" function in ngx\_http\_parse.c
  could cause a NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2009-3896).
* nginx does not properly sanitize user input for the the WebDAV COPY
  or MOVE methods (CVE-2009-3898).
* The "ngx\_resolver\_copy()" function in ngx\_resolver.c contains a
  boundary error which could cause a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2011-4315).
* nginx does not properly parse HTTP header responses which could
  expose sensitive information (CVE-2012-1180).

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the nginx process, cause a Denial of Service condition,
create or overwrite arbitrary files, or obtain sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All nginx users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/nginx-1.0.14"

```

As I far I know - no.

This bug was fixed in 0.8.17 and 0.7.63:

Changes with nginx 0.8.17                                        28 Sep 2009

    *) Security: now "/../" are disabled in "Destination" request header
       line.

Changes with nginx 0.7.63                                        26 Oct 2009

    *) Security: now "/../" are disabled in "Destination" request header
       line.

There is no patch, however, I can created it for you.
