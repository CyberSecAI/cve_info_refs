Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw in the WebDAV component of nginx. It stems from the lack of proper input sanitization of the "Destination" header in WebDAV COPY or MOVE requests. This allows a malicious user to bypass intended access restrictions and place files outside the designated WebDAV root directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The core weakness is the ability to navigate outside the intended directory structure using relative path specifiers like "/../" in the "Destination" header.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The nginx WebDAV module fails to properly validate or sanitize the "Destination" header before using it to perform file operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite:** An attacker with WebDAV COPY or MOVE permissions can create or overwrite files in locations outside the intended WebDAV root directory, potentially leading to system compromise or data corruption.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: By placing malicious files in unexpected locations, attackers can potentially achieve privilege escalation by tricking system processes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **WebDAV COPY or MOVE Requests:** The attack is initiated by sending a crafted HTTP request to the nginx server using the WebDAV COPY or MOVE methods.
*   **Malicious "Destination" Header:** The crafted request includes a "Destination" header containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., "/../") that allow the attacker to specify an arbitrary file path on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WebDAV Permissions:** The attacker must have the ability to send WebDAV COPY or MOVE requests to the nginx server. This means the WebDAV module must be enabled, and the attacker needs the necessary permissions.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable nginx server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in nginx versions 0.8.17 and 0.7.63 by disabling "/../" sequences in the "Destination" header.
*   The provided patch modifies the `ngx_http_dav_module.c` and other related files to introduce the `ngx_http_parse_unsafe_uri` function to validate the URI and prevent directory traversals. It also logs unsafe URIs if `NGX_HTTP_LOG_UNSAFE` is set.
*  The Secunia advisory (http://secunia.com/advisories/36818/) also provides information regarding this vulnerability.
