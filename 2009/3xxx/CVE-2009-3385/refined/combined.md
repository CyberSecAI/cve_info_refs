# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-06

## Scriptable plugin execution in SeaMonkey mail

Announced
March 16, 2010
Reporter
Georgi Guninski
Impact
Critical
Products
SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* SeaMonkey 1.1.19

### Description

Security researcher **Georgi Guninski**
reported that scriptable plugin content, such as Flash objects, could
be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey mail messages by embedding the
content in an iframe inside the message. If a user were to reply to
or forward such a message, malicious JavaScript embedded in the plugin
content could potentially steal the contents of the message or files
from the local filesystem.

Thunderbird was not affected by this issue.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

- libmozhelper-1\_0-0/mozilla-xulrunner190
The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.1
- libopenssl-devel
This update adds support for RFC5746 TLS renegotiations to address
vulnerabilities tracked as (CVE-2009-3555).

- seamonkey
This update brings Mozilla Seamonkey to 1.1.19 fixing various bugs and
security issues.
Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=371976#c0)• 18 years ago |
|  | |

reading html message in seamonkey containing:
<iframe src='<http://server/flash.swf>'></html>
causes exection of flash in preview pane if remote content
is shown.
replying to the message causes execution of flash in editor.
flash fails to load javascript uris.
data:application/x-shockwave-flash;base64, uris instantiate
the flash plugin but don't show the content (same applies to
browser, probably a bug).
active content in email in general is not very good idea.

thunderbird seems safe, probably because doesn't recognize that flash is installed.
bug in the description: </html> should be </iframe>

Thunderbird turns off plugins by default.

> Thunderbird turns off plugins by default.
>
the potential problem is not plugins being enabled by the user.
in seamonkey plugins are also disabled for mailnews and don't seem to work for direct html content, but work in <iframe>.
the potental problem is flash is active content.

Plugins are the very first thing Thunderbird checks. However, SeaMonkey only wants to block plugins in mail. To do this it seems to check whether the root docshell is a mail docshell. Maybe it's doing this incorrectly?

That code is correct. However in this case the load is not done with TYPE\_OBJECT -- it's done with TYPE\_SUBDOCUMENT. At least on trunk. G30rgi, are you testing branch or trunk?
On trunk, we should add a ShouldProcess call, I think.

flash loads on both latest trunk and seamonkey1.1.1.
a simple way to reproduce is compose mail and insert the following html via "insert html"
<iframe src="<http://www.flashfunpages.com/couple.swf>"></iframe>
loads in editor, in preview pane "show remote content" is needed

Hmm... yeah, this could be a problem on branch too.
So how about we add a ShouldProcess call in <http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/content/html/document/src/nsPluginDocument.cpp#92> ? That seems like the right place for it...

according to my tests it doesn't help at all. flash is executed as without the patch. do you need a sample local folder with flash ([comment #6](/show_bug.cgi?id=371976#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - execution of flash in seamonkey mail") is easy to do)?

Oh. Well, I guess it wouldn't help given that nsMsgContentPolicy::ShouldProcess is:
579 {
580 \*aDecision = nsIContentPolicy::ACCEPT;
581 return NS\_OK;
582 }
That'll have to be fixed to, to do something more like nsMsgContentPolicy::ShouldLoad.
As for a sample folder, that wouldn't really help much -- I don't have a flash plugin and don't plan to change that. ;)

What is the potential exploit here? Merely running the plugin can't be 'critical' because we safely run them in a browsing context. <embed>ed plugins would worry me more since a scriptable kind like flash could load javascript: urls and probably sniff out the content of a reply or forward. If they're loaded as an <iframe src=> doesn't our same-origin policy protect us from that?
Clearly there's privacy implications in loading it at all (webbugs) and the risk of having a larger attack surface, but unless there's more that I'm missing the impact sounds "low" for now.
Of course if the seamonkey compose window is chrome-privileged then it's definitely 'critical'. I sure hope we're not that foolish.Whiteboard: [sg:low]

flash runs in editor, but couldn't get chrome so far.
by default plugins are blocked in mail and this bug circumvents this.

I think this is in fact critical -- in a browsing context we run flash off sites the user visit. Here we're running any flash anyone wants to send.

don't have an exploit, but \*suspect\* this may be nasty.
probably it is not only flash - every pluging should do, java tries to start but complains in the java console.

potential exploit vector is DOM tricks in editor.

thunderbird seems safe according to my tests.
it reports flash is installed (i consider this really insane) though flash is not displayed neither in preview nor in editor.
though it is fetched from the server in editor and if remote content is shown.

so i see at least 2 potential problems here.
1. plugins bugs being exploited via email, c.f. quicktime bug.
2. plugins run in editor when replying/forwarding inline. probably plugins being able to modify editor's DOM will mean file stealing via <img src="file:///">

This bug really confuses me, honestly. I debugged it. I posted a core patch that's a prerequisite for fixing it. I pointed out the mailnews-specific code that is also buggy and needs fixing, and sorta explained how to go about fixing it.
What more needs to happen here, short of me fixing the mailnews code myself?

So either the plugin should get instantiated after the document gets its script global object, or NS\_CP\_GetDocShellFromContext should get the docshell from the document's container (which fixes this bug), or we need to work around it.

How come nsPluginDocument::CreateSyntheticPluginDocument()'s check for a "messagepane" docshell doesn't catch this?
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/html/document/src/nsPluginDocument.cpp#258>
Regarding making NS\_CP\_GetDocShellFromContext() get the document from the document container... I don't think we want to do that since that would still let the content policy check happen as early on as it is happening here, which is before the document has a global window. Passing a document, or any node, for which there is no window object yet out to JS doesn't seem like something we want to do.
Seems to me that bz's patch, in combination with code that would prevent nsObjectLoadingContent from doing a content policy check in this particular case would be what we want here. What we're looking at here is a network response that's already coming in and happens to be something that's handled by a plugin, in that case we don't want the nsObjectLoadingContent code to start a new load (and I'd guess it doesn't today), we want it to just initiate itself enough and let the plugin load happen through the stream that's already on its way in...

Then I'd appreciate it if you could fix it so that that doesn't happen!

Would this work:
Remove the line at
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/docshell/base/nsDocShell.cpp#7118>
and add the following code:
docv->SetContainer(aContainer);
at line
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/layout/build/nsContentDLF.cpp#436>
I.e. set the container on the doc viewer at the same time as we set it on the document.
(Why does both documents and documentviewers have a container, seems like a source of bugs, like this one)

It's possible to have document viewers not tied to a document (specifically to change the document in a viewer) and vice versa.... I'd be fine with just storing the container in the document, thought.

That just causes assertions. I restored the line to make my build work again.

Sorry, but that has no effect; the plugin document still has no script global.

So, it turns out that the lack of a script global object was really bad. So bad in fact, that none of our plugin content policies such as the one that triggers when docshell.allowPlugins is false, were getting applied to media documents.
This moves code around to make plugin documents act more like image documents.

We're technically past code-freeze for 1.9.[01] branches, but this seems pretty critical given the high adoption and bug rate of Flash and other plugins.
Do we really block plugins by docshellitem name? What if some other xul app happens to use that name in a non-mail setting? I thought we used app-type for this kind of check.blocking1.9.1: ? → .4+

We get the app-type from the docshell; that first hunk in the patch should make that work, I'd think.
Can we just remove the messagepane hack, given that?

So why can't we iterate ancestor docshells in CreateSyntheticPluginDocument and

Or is this bug now about this and not so much about the initial problem that
plugin document may load flash in Seamonkey-mail?
Basically, are we trying to change content policy or plugin document handling?

I guess both problems get fixed with the patch, if mailnews content policy check
works.
The messagepane hack is ugly. Does mailnews really open some helper app
if a plugin is tried to be loaded as a message (how to even do that)?

Still, r=me, but please file a followup to fix messagepane handling.
It has been there for ages (since [Bug 90256](/show_bug.cgi?id=90256 "RESOLVED FIXED - Can't script Fullpage Plugins")), but better to fix it.
And could you add an assertion to CreateSyntheticDocument to check that either we don't have presshell yet or it hasn't done the initial reflow yet.
(CreateSyntheticPluginDocument doesn't notify, so it should be called early enough.)

With additional assertion
This patch is needed to delay synthetic plugin document content creation until content policy (including Firefox content policy) is capable of dealing with it. Without this patch it is difficult to block plugin content that is served as a document e.g. as the source of a frame.

Yeah -- that's kinda sucky, but I don't think it's a huge issue here -- this bug has blocking1.9.1=".4+", which is stronger than status1.9.1="wanted".
Hence, I'm clearing "status1.9.1", since this was backed out and is no longer ".4-fixed" (though hopefully it will be again, soon :) ).

When I test this with an iframe in a message in the 9/30 Seamonkey 1.9.1 build, I get a prompt to download the .swf file. Should this file even be getting retrieved at all?

This fix only applies to the case where the frame's source is detected being handled by a plugin, so the browser actually has to have Flash installed and configured so that opening a .swf file will play it.
I'm not actually sure at this time of night as it is here what the expected behaviour is for unknown content served in a frame.

I just tested this in the nightly Seamonkey 1.1.19pre build (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.24pre) Gecko/20100218 SeaMonkey/1.1.19pre). This isn't fixed. When I insert the iframe with flash source, it plays in the editor and it plays if I show remote content after I send it to myself.
So, someone should figure out why the fix doesn't work on 1.8.1.

I don't actually see the content policy getting called on the 1.8 branch.
That is to say, I put a breakpoint on nsWebBrowserContentPolicy::ShouldLoad but it was never called with a TYPE\_OBJECT content type.

On 1.8.1 <object> loading works completely differently than in 1.9.
That said, the relevant codepath is nsPluginHostImpl::InstantiateEmbeddedPlugin, which does do a content policy check. Why are you not seeing that call?

Note that we already did cut builds for SeaMonkey 1.1.19 and are planning to EOL the whole 1.x series with that one. We also will not claim that 1.1.19 fixes all known security bugs, just that it is better than 1.1.18 - all security issues are only fixed on 2.x builds.
Due to all that, I'm not sure how high the value of trying to fix this on 1.8.1.x is right now.

Oh, this is a full-page plugin, isn't it? Right.
Looking over this code again, I don't understand why your earlier patch without the addition of my original patch in this bug fixed anything. It would block an attempt by the nsObjectLoadingContent to instantiate from LoadObject, but that's not what sets up the plugin.
I think you really do need my original patch in this bug to fix the issue on 1.8, and as far as I can see to fix it on anything else as well.

Then what does? (I guess I could breakpoint trunk and reverse engineer...)

Not needed on 1.9+, because the bug there was that ShouldLoad was called at a point where NS\_CP\_GetDocShellFromContext failed.

Yes, but that ShouldLoad call comes before code that actually does nothing in the full-page plugin case, usually. So I don't see why the patch that was checked in helped anything.

Actually it isn't, it's nsPluginHostImpl::InstantiateFullPagePlugin, which doesn't do any content policy checks at all :-(

I'm failing to see the relevance, since that's adding a ShouldProcess call that nobody (e.g. nsWebBrowserContentPolicy::ShouldProcess) cares about.

Well, the point is that it should be caring about it, if that's the content policy that you rely on to stop the plug-in instantiation. The load that actually loads the plug-in does not go through ShouldLoad with TYPE\_OBJECT for full-page plug-ins.

I guess trunk works differently then - nsObjectLoadingContent::LoadObject makes the ShouldLoad(TYPE\_OBJECT, ...) check.

Yes, but for full-page plug-ins it doesn't actually do the load! So the results of that check are simply ignored.

I don't know what you mean by ignored; the result of NS\_CheckContentLoadPolicy is used to determine whether to call HandleBeingBlockedByContentPolicy.

Oh, I see. So we keep doing the load but never end up with an object frame and so never instantiate. OK. That explains why it works (Totally by accident!) in 1.9 and above.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
