  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2009-3385",
    "description": "The vulnerability is due to the possibility of loading and executing scriptable plugin content, such as Flash objects, within SeaMonkey mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe. When a user replies to or forwards a message containing such content, malicious JavaScript embedded in the plugin could steal the message's content or files from the local system.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the ability to load and execute plugin content within an iframe in a SeaMonkey mail message, bypassing the intended restrictions on active content within emails.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation allowing execution of plugin content in an email context.",
      "Insufficient content policy enforcement for iframes in mail messages.",
        "Lack of proper isolation or sandboxing for plugin execution within email."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could craft a malicious email containing a Flash object embedded in an iframe. If the recipient replies to or forwards the email, the malicious Flash content can execute arbitrary Javascript code. This may lead to information theft, arbitrary file system access and potentially remote code execution on the victim's machine.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted email containing an iframe with a malicious Flash object."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send emails to a target who is using SeaMonkey. The email must include an iframe with a reference to a malicious flash object."
