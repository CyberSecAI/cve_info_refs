How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=515191#c0)• 15 years ago |
|  | |

Unfortunately, Bug.search does not validate its parameters to determine that the keys are valid.
The WebService does not taint its incoming parameters.
Bugzilla::Object->match does not validate its parameters, and will allow arbitrary SQL through in keys.
Interestingly enough, I haven't actually found a way to exploit it in a way that destroys data, due to the way that DBD::mysql and DBD::Pg work--DBD::mysql recognizes ";" as a syntax error, and Pg won't prepare multiple statements. I can't quite find anything harmful to do in a subquery, either.
It also can't violate security restrictions, because we call visible\_bugs on the returned result.
However, SQL injections are still a bad, bad thing. Even if \*I\* can't find a way to exploit this one, I'm sure somebody will.

How does that "expose it"? It just means there's some type of bug that isn't viewable by most people (but probably a security bug), but the people on that other bug have no idea what it is exactly. People could also think it's just a typo or something.

It's actually very easy to bypass security restrictions, and a logged out user
can get all the data he wants, including restricted bugs, private attachment
data, user passwords, etc.... Basically, all the DB content is freely
accessible. But I guess I shouldn't write here how to do this.
That's one of the most critical bug we ever had. We need to CC as many Bugzilla
administrators as possible (NASA, KDE, Mandriva, ....), well before we release 3.4.2, so that they can apply the patch locally before the bug becomes public. They cannot afford to be unpatched when 3.4.2 is available.

It points out that something in the bug you set the dependency on caused a security issue. There have been multiple instances on b.m.o where it's been proven that someone tracked down a security bug ahead of time that way because there are people who scan activity on bmo \*looking\* for things to exploit. If they know something on that patch caused a security bug, they'll scrutinize it until they figure out what it was. The fact that a new bug was filed at almost the same time suggesting that Bug.search should taint the incoming parameters gives a \*really\* good clue where to look, too. That bug probably shouldn't have been filed until this was made public.

You should throw an error here. If I pass bug\_ids => 1, this wrong key will be ignored, and all visible bugs will be returned, which is not what you want.

Using hash keys for FIELD\_MAP is wrong as described above.
Also, I still manage to inject SQL thanks to OFFSET which is not validated by Object->match(). So I could pass limit => 'some SQL string' and the string will be passed as is to Object->match(). OFFSET should be validated using either detaint\_natural() or detaint\_signed().

Hmm, that would change the API--not something I want to do on a stable branch.

Okay, I think I need to finish the WebService tainting feature here first so that we can be sure that we've eliminated every possible injection.

Currently, the SQL server crashes. I wouldn't call it an API change. In both cases do you get an error.

Your patch doesn't fix this problem. Unless I miss something, OFFSET must be an interger, so you should call detaint\_natural() on it and throw an error if it's not valid. I think Object::match() is the right place to do this check.
Also, why do you call ThrowCodeError() if the field doesn't exist? Here, it's the user's fault, so it should be ThrowUserError().

The error is from code-error. We use it elsewhere in the same file already. The WebService clients have no idea whether it's a code error or a user error being thrown.
I will fix the offset and limit stuff.

This fixes it at the edge (Bug.search) instead of fixing it in the core (Object->match). I did this because I want to be warned if tainted data gets into those parameters in the future. Also, what I really want to do in Object->match is use placeholders--but using placeholders there would break Oracle at the moment, because of the hack the Oracle driver uses to implement LIMIT.

This is also possibly exploitable in Bug.create, meaning that this affects all versions of Bugzilla back to 3.0.Target Milestone: Bugzilla 3.4 → Bugzilla 3.0

My suspicion at the moment is that the Bug.create version is not exploitable. The SQL in question is
INSERT INTO $table ( {@field\_names} ) VALUES ($qmarks)
where $qmarks is a list of placeholder question marks. You can't SQL-inject via placeholders, so passing something in a field name would be the only way to inject. Any payload you could stick in there (even by using a valid field name followed by a close paren and your payload after that) would be mutually exclusive with the VALUES() construct on the end, and would end up throwing an error anyway.
We know DBD::mysql throws an error if you try to include a ";" in a query. What about DBD::Pg and DBD::Oracle? The DBI docs say it blindly passes your query through to the driver, so it'd be up to the driver whether it bails or not...

Also note that [bug 515328](/show_bug.cgi?id=515328 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Object->create() and Object->match() should validate that their fields are actually valid database columns") handles this on HEAD in a much more elegant way than the patches attached here (though I still want the patches attached here to land on the branches).

And [bug 513593](/show_bug.cgi?id=513593 "RESOLVED FIXED - The WebService should taint incoming parameters") should make it much more difficult for things like this to happen via the WebService in the future. So we're really attacking this from all angles to make sure that it can never happen again.

That's what I think too. IMO, only 3.3.2 and newer are vulnerable via Bug.search(), which is the topic of this bug, btw. IMO, there is no need to backport this patch to 3.0 and 3.2, or this should be done in a separate bug but without the mention to be a security fix. Here, we are giving a false alarm that 3.0 and 3.2 are also vulnerable, which is not true, AFAICS.

What justdave tried doesn't call Bug.create(). I still manage to do SQL
injection with Bug.create(), but I actually cannot insert anything as it
triggers an error. So that's less critical, but should still be fixed.

OK, the error is because we use hashes and it's hard to guess in which order the keys will be sorted the next time the script is run. But I guess that with enough attempts, we may be lucky enough and trigger what we want. So we should also CC admins of main 3.0 and 3.2 installations, not only those mentioned in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=515191#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] SQL Injection via Bug.search (CVE-2009-3125) and Bug.create (CVE-2009-3165)").

Okay, here's a different patch for 3.0, going back to fixing this just in the WebService.
I tried to think about how to safely load \_bz\_real\_schema before Object::create() was called, but there was no way that I could do it that I could guarantee wouldn't cause any strange side effects. So for 3.0, we're going back to fixing this at the affected callsite, which is also a much smaller patch that only affects a single file, in any case.

 Hello administrators of major Bugzilla installations! You are being CC'ed on this bug so that you have a chance to patch your installation before the security advisory is made public.
Please do not mention the security issue anywhere public, and please do not check the patch into any publicly-available version control server. Basically,
do not expose the patch or the vulnerability in any way, before we release.

I would estimate between 24 and 48 hours. Given where we are with the release process, I could probably release tomorrow, though if there's some sort of snafu it could take until Friday.

No, it's two separate vulnerabilities--one in Object::match (which has predictable SQL and only affects 3.4) and another in Object::create (which has randomized SQL and affects back to 2.23.3 or so). See the Security Advisory for details. They just both happen to have a very similar fix.

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

# 3.4.1, 3.2.4, and 3.0.8 Security Advisory

Friday, Sep 11th, 2009
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Two SQL injection attacks have been discovered in Bugzilla. One
  only affects the 3.4 series, while the other affects
  the 3.0, 3.2, and 3.4 series. These are extremely serious
  vulnerabilities that must be patched immediately.

* Two SQL injection attacks have been discovered in Bugzilla. One
  only affects the 3.4 series, while the other affects
  the 3.0, 3.2, and 3.4 series. These are extremely serious
  vulnerabilities that must be patched immediately.

* When a user would change his password, his new password would
  be exposed in the URL field of the browser if he logged in right
  after changing his password.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       SQL Injection
Affected:    3.3.2 to 3.4.1, 3.5
Fixed In:    3.4.2
Description: It is possible to inject raw SQL into the Bugzilla
             database via the Bug.search WebService function. This
             could be used to expose any data stored in the Bugzilla
             database, including confidential bugs. It is also possible
             that an attacker could modify or delete any data stored in
             the Bugzilla database (though we haven't discovered a
             working exploit that modifies or deletes data).

             The danger of this exploit is slightly lessened by the
             fact that Bugzilla's backend does not accept multiple
             statements separated by a semicolon, so you cannot add
             additional SQL statements (such as a DELETE or INSERT)
             using the exploit. However, this is still an extremely
             critical issue which administrators should patch
             immediately.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=515191
CVE Number:  CVE-2009-3125

Class:       SQL Injection
Affected:    2.23.4 to 3.0.8, 3.1.1 to 3.2.4, 3.3.1 to 3.4.1
Fixed In:    3.0.9, 3.2.5, 3.4.2
Description: It is possible to inject raw SQL into the Bugzilla
             database via the Bug.create WebService function. This
             could be used to expose any data stored in the Bugzilla
             database, including confidential bugs. It is also possible
             that an attacker could modify or delete any data stored in
             the Bugzilla database (though we haven't discovered a
             working exploit that modifies or deletes existing data).

             The danger of this exploit is slightly lessened by the
             fact that Bugzilla's backend does not accept multiple
             statements separated by a semicolon, so you cannot add
             additional SQL statements (such as a DELETE or UPDATE)
             using the exploit.

             This particular hole is much more difficult to exploit
             than the Bug.search one, due to the fact that the SQL
             around the insertion point is highly random, making it
             difficult for an attacker to craft a successful attack.

             However, even considering these factors, this is still an
             extremely critical issue which administrators should patch
             immediately.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=515191
CVE Number:  CVE-2009-3165

Class:       Sensitive Data Exposure
Affected:    3.4rc1 to 3.4.1
Fixed In:    3.4.2
Description: When a user reset their password and then logged
             in immediately afterward, their password would appear
             in the URL of their browser, which also possibly means
             that that password would appear in the Bugzilla
             webserver's logs and in the Referer header of any page
             whose link was clicked immediately after logging in
             (although by default Bugzilla only links to itself, on
             that page).
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=508189
CVE Number:  CVE-2009-3166
