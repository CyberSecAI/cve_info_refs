Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Bugzilla displaying the alias of hidden bugs in the "Depends On" and "Blocks" lists of other bugs, even to users who do not have permission to view those hidden bugs. This was introduced in Bugzilla version 3.3.2 as part of a change to show aliases instead of bug IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Leakage: The core issue is that sensitive information (bug aliases) is being revealed to unauthorized users.
- Improper Access Control: Bugzilla fails to properly check user permissions before displaying bug aliases in dependency lists.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of Hidden Bugs: Attackers can gain knowledge of bug aliases for bugs they are not meant to see. Although the details of the bugs are still protected, knowing the alias may allow an attacker to infer information about sensitive bugs.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Dependency Lists: The vulnerability is triggered by viewing bug dependency lists.
- User Position: An attacker simply needs to be a Bugzilla user who is not authorized to see the hidden bugs, while having access to other bugs that depend on or block the hidden bugs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Must have a Bugzilla account.
- Must have the ability to view at least one public bug that has a dependency on or blocks a hidden bug.
- No special privileges are needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Bugzilla versions 3.3.2 to 3.4.3 and 3.5 to 3.5.1.
- It was fixed in versions 3.4.4 and 3.5.2.
- The vulnerability is a regression introduced by bug 470262
- Patches were created to fix this issue on both the trunk and 3.4 branch.
- The fix involves adding a permission check using  `can_see_bug()` to ensure a user is authorized to view the alias before it is displayed.
- The bug was reported by Jesse Ruderman.
- The fix was developed by Dave Miller, Frédéric Buclin, and Max Kanat-Alexander.
- The bug was assigned CVE-2009-3386.
