The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi).

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes

# 3.4.3 and 3.5.1 Security Advisory

Wednesday, Nov 18th, 2009
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issue has been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Aliases of hidden bugs would show up in the "Depends On" and "Blocks"
  list of other bugs, even if you didn't have permission to see the
  hidden bugs.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Information Leak
Affected:    3.3.2 to 3.4.3, 3.5 to 3.5.1
Fixed In:    3.4.4, 3.5.2
Description: When a bug is in a group, none of its information
             (other than its status and resolution) should be visible
             to users outside that group. It was discovered that
             as of 3.3.2, Bugzilla was showing the alias of the bug
             (a very short string used as a shortcut for looking up
             the bug) to users outside of the group, if the protected
             bug ended up in the "Depends On" or "Blocks" list of any
             other bug.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=529416
CVE Number:  CVE-2009-3386

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for this issue is included in the
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fix will
protect your installation from possible exploits of this issue.

If you are unable to upgrade but would like to patch just the security
vulnerability, there are patches available for the issue at the
"References" URL.

Full release downloads, patches to upgrade Bugzilla from previous
versions, and git upgrade instructions are available at:

  https://www.bugzilla.org/download/

List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

I was thinking that, but that section of code is dependent on having a status or something, and didn't know how that would affect it, that's why I didn't move it.

Patch v1 for 3.4
No, actually, this is the right fix. The can\_see\_bug below is unrelated.
I'd like to create an $user var and re-use it so that we don't have to manually do Bugzilla->user->can\_see\_bug in both places, but this works OK.

Tiny stylistic nit: brace goes on the next line aligned with the "i" in "if". (It's perlstyle.)
I'll test this, but this looks fine.

As I said earlier, this should be moved into the IF block below. All bugs have a bug status. We use it to check if the bug ID points to an existing bug. If the bug doesn't exist, it's undefined, else it exists. No need to call can\_see\_bug() twice.

Actually, I think the patch as justdave wrote it is more readable, and there's no performance penalty for calling can\_see\_bug multiple times.

LpSolit pointed out that in this version we're calling can\_see\_bug before verifying that the bug exists, so this one indeed should have a different patch.
