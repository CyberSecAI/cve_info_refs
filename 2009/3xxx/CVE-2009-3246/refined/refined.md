Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2009-3246:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL Injection flaw in the `spnews.php` file of the Mybuxscript PTC-BUX application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter when querying the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
*   This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   In some cases, it could lead to a complete compromise of the database server.
*   The provided exploit demonstrates a `UNION SELECT` injection to retrieve the database version, which indicates an information disclosure impact as well.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   No authentication or specific position within the application is needed, as the attack is performed through a publicly accessible page.

**Technical Details:**

*   The specific vulnerable parameter is `id`.
*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement appended to a negative `id` value to bypass the original SQL query and inject a custom one.
*   Example exploit URL: `http://localhost/Path/?p=spnews&id=-7+UNION+SELECT+1,version(),3,4--`
