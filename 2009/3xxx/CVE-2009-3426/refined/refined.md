Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3426:

**CVE Description:** The provided text does not contain an official CVE description.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of user-supplied input in MAXcms 3.11.20b, specifically within two files:
    * `includes/inc.thcms_admin_dirtree.php`:  The `thCMS_root` parameter is not sanitized, leading to potential directory traversal.
    * `includes/file_manager/special.php`: The `fm_includes_special` parameter allows the inclusion of a remote file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `special.php` file directly includes a file specified by the `fm_includes_special` parameter.
* **File Disclosure (Information Leakage):** The `inc.thcms_admin_dirtree.php` file uses the `readfile()` function to display content of a file, which is controlled by the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **RFI:** An attacker could include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially gaining full control of the affected web server.
* **File Disclosure:** An attacker could access and read files from the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information such as database credentials or configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerabilities are exploited by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests containing specific parameters.
* The attacker can exploit both vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the server targeting the vulnerable scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No specific positioning or special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
* The attacker must know the location of the vulnerable PHP scripts.

**Specific Vulnerability Details from Exploit-DB**

* **File Disclosure:** The file `includes/inc.thcms_admin_dirtree.php` when called with `getjs=1` parameter, reads and returns the content of `wz_dragdrop.js` . An attacker can control `thCMS_root` by adding it to the request and use it to traverse the filesystem. The provided example exploits this by setting `thCMS_root=inc.thcms_admin_dirtree.php%00`. This will cause it to read itself rather than `wz_dragdrop.js` but other values for this parameter can also be supplied to read arbitrary files from the server.
* **Remote File Inclusion:** The `includes/file_manager/special.php` script includes the file specified in the `fm_includes_special` parameter without sanitization. An attacker can provide a malicious URL to execute code on the server. The provided example uses `http://localhost/020.txt` to illustrate this vulnerability.
