Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw within the CMScontrol application. The `id_menu` parameter in the `index.php` script is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied data is used to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Database access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application's database, potentially exposing sensitive data like usernames and passwords.
    *   **Data modification/deletion:** The attacker could also modify or delete data within the database.

*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of CMScontrol. Specifically, the `index.php` script and the `id_menu` parameter.
    *  A specially crafted URL is used that includes SQL syntax to manipulate the database query.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
    *   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft a malicious query.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided exploit example shows how to use `UNION SELECT` statements to extract usernames and passwords from the `users` table.
* A Google dork is provided to find potentially vulnerable sites.
* The exploit is specific to CMScontrol version 7.*.
