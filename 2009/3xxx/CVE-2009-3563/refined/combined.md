How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c0)  Danny Mayer    2009-10-04 22:27:11 UTC  ``` From dmitri vinokurov: We believe there is a flaw in NTP which allows to build an effective and easy exploitable DoS attack. The topology used includes two nodes running ntp and an attacker's PC:  PC--->  [node1 ntpd1]:11.0.0.1 --------11.0.0.2:[node2 ntpd2]  PC sends one crafted UDP packet with one byte payload 0x17, i.e. NTP Request in mode 7. This UDP packet has spoofed source IP of 11.0.0.2, destination = 11.0.0.1, source port 123 and destination port 123. Node1 responds with mode 7 Error Response to Node2, and here comes something we cannot conceive. Ntpd2 responds back with the same mode 7 Error Response to Node1, Ntpd1 does again the same, etc. with the aggregate rate of few thousand pps. CPU is taken away on both sides, network is busy... Better yet, if we spoof the Node1's address 11.0.0.1 as a source, Node1 sends all these packets to itself all the time! Endless. Payload "97 00 00 00" (Response mode 7) works too.  We believe ntpd must either drop an unexpected mode 7 Response, or drop any mode 7 packets originated from port 123 (they have to use high number source ports).  Authentication and ACLs may help, but these are rather workarounds. Would it be possible to address the core issue? ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c1)  Danny Mayer    2009-10-04 22:34:25 UTC  ``` I haven't looked at the code yet, but it should just drop any packets that are shorter than the minimum size. That's the first problem. The second problem is that a node receiving an error response should not be responding automatically to it with it's own error response. Receipt of an error response should not be responded to.  Danny ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c2)  Danny Mayer    2009-10-04 22:39:42 UTC  ``` From Dave Mills:  That code was last touched by Dennis Fergusson circa 1984. It should be fixed.  The cardinal rule, at least in the mainline code, is that packets with bad format, wrong length or incorrect version are always dropped and do nothing except increment a tattletale. Control/monitor packets can't be checked by the mainline code, since the packet lengths are different.  As you know, I would much, much rather strip ntpdc of anything except raw debug.  There is actually a much easier way to mount a DoS attack. Thrwow monlist commands at ntpdc at a nice fat rate. The monitoring tools should be subject to the same rate controls as the mainline code.  ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c3)  Danny Mayer    2009-10-04 22:40:57 UTC  ``` From dmitri vinokurov:  Dave, Danny, Thanks for your comments and acknowledgement. I believe there is still some misunderstanding though. - the problem is NOT in lack of format/length/version control, sanity check, etc. - all this can be made up in the first rogue packet. Danny got it right - "Receipt of an error response should not be responded to", and this is the core issue. Ntpd endlessly responds even to itself, on the same platform. - the exploit is as trivial as to send one individual packet - ntpd does all the flooding job for us by itself, and this is indeed easier than to throw whatever commands at a fat rate. The result is - CPU load goes up to 100% on both sides depending on the platform, network is busy, and no skills required to exploit this. The overall risk is very high. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c4)  Danny Mayer    2009-10-05 04:47:36 UTC  ``` I have checked in a fix in my repo on pogo ntp-dev-1331.  This repo is only for this fix.  Danny ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c5)  Harlan Stenn    2009-10-05 04:59:32 UTC  ``` Subject: DoS with mode 7 packets   Thanks Danny.  I've asked CERT for a CVE for this issue.  I'll schedule the release with them.  H    --  Harlan Stenn <stenn@ntp.org> ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c6)  Dave Hart    2009-10-05 08:21:10 UTC  ``` The fix in Danny's repo looks a bit wrong to me.  The test ISRESPONSE() is still  being done by the code which will log a message and transmit a reply.  Shouldn't  it be moved up to the new code which will return without logging or replying? ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c7)  Harlan Stenn    2009-10-05 09:00:41 UTC  ``` I'm presently going to let this bug block 4.2.6. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c8)  Danny Mayer    2009-10-05 12:48:06 UTC  ``` Re [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c6). No, that deals with the version of the NTP packet and really does not matter one way or another. We're ignoring responses in any case.  Danny ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c9)  Dave Hart    2009-10-05 15:16:24 UTC  ``` Danny, re [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c8), I'm confused.  In [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c3) you quote Dmitri correctly  noting the crux of the issue is ntpd responding to mode 7 responses.  Yet your  ntp-dev-1331 has this code:    ec = 0;   if (   (++ec, INFO_SEQ(inpkt->auth_seq) != 0)       || (++ec, INFO_ERR(inpkt->err_nitems) != 0)       || (++ec, INFO_MBZ(inpkt->mbz_itemsize) != 0)       || (++ec, rbufp->recv_length < REQ_LEN_HDR)           ) {                   return;   }    if (   (++ec, ISRESPONSE(inpkt->rm_vn_mode))       || (++ec, ISMORE(inpkt->rm_vn_mode))       || (++ec, INFO_VERSION(inpkt->rm_vn_mode) > NTP_VERSION)       || (++ec, INFO_VERSION(inpkt->rm_vn_mode) < NTP_OLDVERSION)           ) {           msyslog(LOG_ERR, "process_private: INFO_ERR_FMT: test %d failed, pkt  from %s", ec, stoa(srcadr));           req_ack(srcadr, inter, inpkt, INFO_ERR_FMT);           return;   }  This fixes ntpd responding to runt packets and those with nonzero auth_seq,  err_nitems, and mbz_itemsize, but it leaves the crux of the issue in place, by  still logging and replying to responses.  I'm not talking about the version  checks in the second if, I'm talking about the ISRESPONSE() test.  Why should  ntpd log and reply to a response?  I would reopen the bug, but I'm not  interested in playing bugzilla ping-pong. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c10)  Danny Mayer    2009-10-05 16:13:33 UTC  ``` I have now fixed that in the repository. I managed to miss that. It's probably not going to make much of a difference but the possibility is something to be managed.  Danny ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c11)  Harlan Stenn    2009-10-06 00:19:04 UTC  ``` Updated to include CVE-2009-3563 . ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c12)  Harlan Stenn    2009-10-06 00:19:51 UTC  ``` Dmitri,  What "citation" should we use when crediting the "discovery" of this CVE? ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c13)  Dmitri Vinokurov    2009-10-06 03:35:44 UTC  ``` Subject: DoS with mode 7 packets (CVE-2009-3563)  Harlan, To be honest, I am struggling with the translation of the term  "citation" in this context. My best bet would be the name(s) and affiliation of those that the  credits go to. Is that right? If so, you can credit Robin Park an myself of Alcatel-Lucent. Thank you, Dmitri  Harlan Stenn via the NTP Bugzilla wrote: [---=| TOFU protection by t-prot: 11 lines snipped |=---]    --  Dmitri Vinokurov <dmitri.vinokurov@alcatel-lucent.com> ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c14)  Dave Hart    2009-10-07 01:59:04 UTC  ``` After studying how ntp_control.c handles similar issues with mode 6 packets, I  have a slightly different fix prepared.  My patch leaves the original big if (  ec++, ... block intact, and changes its body in two ways.  First, for any of  those initial sanity checks, a failure will not elicit a response.  This is the  way mode 6 and mainline code deals with malformed packets.  Second, the msyslog  is made conditional on NLOG_SYSEVENT and rate-limited to once per minute.  The  rate limiting allows ntpd to log the fact of malformed or malicious packets in  this path without risking flooding if, for example, a broadcast or multicast  address ntpd is listening on is targeted.  In that situation, the fact that ntpd  no longer responds may not be enough to stop the flood, as others sharing the  address may be responding.  This is prepared as a ntp-stable delta pulled into ntp-dev in:  psp-deb1:~hart/ntp-stable-1331 psp-deb1:~hart/ntp-dev-1331  As it touches only ChangeLog and ntpd/ntp_request.c it would be trivial to make  an equivalent freestanding ntp-dev-1331 if the decision is made to fix it in  ntp-dev alone first. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c15)  Danny Mayer    2009-10-07 03:13:54 UTC  ``` The number one rule of security fixes is to keep the fixes simple so that vendors, if necessary can backport the fix to earlier releases. There are assumptions here in your proposed changes that are only valid for the latest releases and should not be assumed to be valid for earlier releases. The important part is to make clear what needs to be changed. This is not just for 4.2.4 but needs to be easy to do for earlier releases. Enhancements like you are suggesting can happen later but should be done with additional thought to what really needs to be logged and that has not been mapped out yet.  Danny ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c16)  Dave Hart    2009-10-07 03:26:58 UTC  ``` Danny, I agree it is important to keep the patch simple and focused.  If you  compare my proposed patch with yours I think you'll see mine is simpler.  It  does not split the early sanity checks into two parts, it does not rearrange the  order of the tests, and thereby the meaning of the logged test numbers.  What it does do is keep to the ntpd practice in mode 6 and mainline processing  of dropping malformed packets without a peep in responses, and add rate-limiting  code to ensure the msyslog triggered by the big if statement happens no more  than once per minute.  I stand by my proposed patch as a simpler, more focused fix and one that brings  mode 7 handling in line with other packet input code paths in ntpd.  Please compare for yourself by browsing:  psp-deb1:~hart/ntp-dev-1331.pupatch.txt and psp-deb1:~hart/ntp-dev-1331-mayer.pupatch.txt ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c17)  Danny Mayer    2009-10-07 03:58:25 UTC  ``` One more check added to the dropped packet list and checked in.  Danny ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c18)  Harlan Stenn    2009-10-22 06:05:09 UTC  ``` I sent the patch to CERT and they are alerting the vendors.  We also have a VU number from them.  CERT prefers to have at least 45 days' time for vendors to apply the patch and test it.  They have asked us if Tuesday 8 December is an acceptable "announce" date.  That seems fine with me, anybody disagree? ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c19)  Danny Mayer    2009-10-28 02:55:38 UTC  ``` [Comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c14) raises an interesting point, that I haven't had a chance to check, having overlooked it when I first read it. If a mode 6 or mode 7 packet arrives from a multicast or broadcast address it should always be dropped even if the packet is valid. In fact the only packets arriving on those addresses should be the broadcast (mode 5) packets. I haven't looked to see if they are being dropped. I'll open a separate bug report on this but I don't think it would classify as a security issue.  Danny ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c20)  Dave Hart    2009-10-28 03:18:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c19)) > If a mode 6 or mode 7 packet arrives > from a multicast or broadcast address it should always be dropped even if the > packet is valid.  Good idea.  Drop mode 6 and mode 7 packets addressed to a broadcast or multicast  address (not from).  I would be very careful in testing all supported  configurations before I'd attempt to drop mode 1-5 sent to *cast addresses. ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c21)  Danny Mayer    2009-10-28 03:24:29 UTC  ``` Yes, I meant to broadcast or multicast address. You meant dropping modes 1-4 since 5 is the broadcast packet.  Danny ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c22)  Harlan Stenn    2009-11-04 21:03:56 UTC  ``` Adding Brian Utterback to the Cc: list, as he received info from CERT about this and it's easier to let him read this report than send him information. ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c23)  Dave Hart    2009-11-10 18:26:29 UTC  ``` Martin Burnicki and Heiko Gerstung of Meinberg should be notified so that they  can prepare patched releases wrapped in updated installers to be ready for  coordinated release.  Although uncompensated, Meinberg essentially is a NTP  vendor in the CERT sense for Windows users.  In that regard, I regret not giving  them 45 days like the rest of the vendors.  Even if there are no kinks building a  patched release, I know it takes some time and steps to produce the installer.  They can be added to the CC list assuming there are no objections raised. ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c24)  Dave Hart    2009-12-05 02:31:22 UTC  ``` There are two restrict bits that if found will prevent reaching the buggy code.   RES_IGNORE, and RES_NOQUERY.  So "restrict default noquery" and including noquery  on all restrict lines except those where ntpq and ntpdc queries must be permitted  is a workaround. ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c25)  Danny Mayer    2009-12-06 05:12:16 UTC  ``` This is already documented in the CERT. You cannot *any* permit any ntpq or ntpdc queries if you want to be safe.

The fix for this problem is in 4.2.4p8 and 4.2.6. ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c27)  Danny Mayer    2009-12-09 02:09:38 UTC  ``` Harlan, I'm not sure I understand your comment. If you are talking about [comment #25](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c25), you don't have a choice since the restrict statement does not allow you to differentiate between mode 6 and mode 7, otherwise I would agree.  Danny ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c28)  Brian Utterback    2009-12-29 19:11:57 UTC  ``` Looking at the handling of the of the request packet, I am surprised that you did not follow the handling in parallel with the way ntp_control handles control packets. Or perhaps even simpler.  I believe that the following patch would also have eliminated the problem:  *** ntp_request.c.fcs   Tue Dec 29 13:57:14 2009 --- ntp_request.c       Tue Dec 29 13:59:34 2009 *************** *** 447,454 ****          * error if it fails.          */         ec = 0; !       if (   (++ec, ISRESPONSE(inpkt->rm_vn_mode)) !           || (++ec, ISMORE(inpkt->rm_vn_mode))             || (++ec, INFO_VERSION(inpkt->rm_vn_mode) > NTP_VERSION)             || (++ec, INFO_VERSION(inpkt->rm_vn_mode) < NTP_OLDVERSION)             || (++ec, INFO_SEQ(inpkt->auth_seq) != 0) --- 447,454 ----          * error if it fails.          */         ec = 0; !       if (rbufp->recv_length < REQ_LEN_HDR || (++ec, ISRESPONSE(inpkt->rm_vn_mode))) return; !       if (   (++ec, ISMORE(inpkt->rm_vn_mode))             || (++ec, INFO_VERSION(inpkt->rm_vn_mode) > NTP_VERSION)             || (++ec, INFO_VERSION(inpkt->rm_vn_mode) < NTP_OLDVERSION)             || (++ec, INFO_SEQ(inpkt->auth_seq) != 0)   Of course, just as a matter of style, I think that the test for the data actually being there should be done before looking at the data. I think that the current set of tests will actually access uninitialized data in the order they currently are in.  But the key field for this attack is the response bit. The req_ack function always sets the response bit, so you can never get into a loop is you ignore packets with the response bit set.  I don't see any reason to log it. If you want to get fancy, then you could set up a counter. But the current fix is too draconian, never sending back a response to any type of error and logging the event in such a way as to require disable logging for as time. That seems kind of silly. ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c29)  Dave Hart    2009-12-31 17:05:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #28](show_bug.cgi?id=1331#c28)) > Of course, just as a matter of style, I think that the test for the data > actually being there should be done before looking at the data. I think that > the current set of tests will actually access uninitialized data in the order > they currently are in.  I'd agree if I were writing this code from scratch.  The patch was intended to  be as narrow as possible while addressing the bug.  Moving the test for the  received length first does not seem worth doing to me even in ntp-dev only, as  the receive buffers are always big enough that we're not risking a fault by  checking potentially uninitialized data, and if the leftover garbage being  examined in processing a runt happens to pass all the other checks in that  compound if with the "++ec"s, it will still be rejected due to the size.  So I'm  failing to see what bug you'd be fixing by shuffling the length check to be  first.  > But the key field for this attack is the response bit. The req_ack function > always sets the response bit, so you can never get into a loop is you ignore > packets with the response bit set.  I don't see any reason to log it. If you > want to get fancy, then you could set up a counter.  The reason for the logging is so you can be aware someone is trying to involve  your ntpd in a screaming match.  In particular, imagine the case where a  broadcast configuration is targetted.  The logging would let you see which  machines listening on the broadcast address are running vulnerable code and  keeping the spew alive, so you can fix them.  > But the current fix is too > draconian, never sending back a response to any type of error  Why is it important to send any response to a malformed packet?  Dropping  without response is what is done for malformed packets in all the other ntpd  paths.  > and logging the event in such a way as to require disable logging > for as time. That seems kind of silly.  Logging is not disabled -- this one message is rate-limited to no more than once  per minute, for those not using syslog with its duplicate suppression.  It could  also help when a ntpd is involved in volleys with more than one other ntpd,  where syslog duplicate suppression might not contain the log spew.  If you have a patch that you believe makes things less silly, by all means  propose it. ``` |  |

## NTP mode 7 denial-of-service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#568372

Original Release Date: 2009-12-08 | Last Revised: 2011-07-22

---

### Overview

NTP contains a vulnerability in the handling of mode 7 requests, which can result in a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| NTP mode 7 (MODE\_PRIVATE) is used by the ntpdc query and control utility. In contrast, ntpq uses NTP mode 6 (MODE\_CONTROL), while routine NTP time transfers use modes 1 through 5. Upon receipt of an incorrect mode 7 request or a mode 7 error response from an address that is not listed in a "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" segment, ntpd will reply with a mode 7 error response and log a message.  If an attacker spoofs the source address of ntpd host A in a mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host B, both A and B will continuously send each other error responses, for as long as those packets get through.If an attacker spoofs an address of ntpd host A in a mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host A, then host A will respond to itself endlessly, consuming CPU and logging excessively. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service condition on a vulnerable NTP server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in NTP 4.2.4p8. Please check with your vendor for an update, or you may download [NTP 4.2.4p8 from ntp.org](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html). |
| --- |

| **Configure NTP to limit source addresses**By using "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" entries in the ntp.conf file, ntpd can be configured to limit the source addresses to which it will respond.**Filter NTP mode 7 packets that specify source and destination port 123**In most cases, ntpdc mode 7 requests will have either a source or destination port of 123, but not both.**Use anti-spoofing IP address filters**[RFC 2827 (BCP 38)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2827) describes network ingress filtering, which can prevent UDP traffic claiming to be from a local address from entering your network from an outside source. Some ISPs may employ unicast reverse path filtering ([uRPF](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3704)) to limit the spoofed traffic that can enter your network. |

---

**Builds**

* Upgrade to autogen-5.18.5pre1
* from 4.2.6p3-RC11: Bump minimum Automake version to 1.11, required for `AM_COND_IF` use in `LIBOPTS_CHECK`.
* Automake-1.12 wants us to use `AM_PROG_AR`.
* Use a single set of Automake options for each package in `configure.ac AM_INIT`, remove `Makefile.am AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS=` lines.
* Enable all relevant `automake` warnings.
* from 4.2.6p3-RC12: Relax minimum Automake version to 1.10 with updated `libopts.m4`.
* Try bison-3.0.2 instead of bison-2.5.
* Upgrade to libevent-2.1.3-alpha-dev.
* Correct `event_base_gettimeofday_cached()` workaround code in `sntp` to work with corrected `libevent`.
* Allow for version suffix in `libevent` in `ntp_libevent.m4`.
* Fix `make distcheck` with `--enable-libevent-regress` problem with unwritable `$srcdir`.
* Don’t build `libevent` with openssl support. Right now, `libevent` doesn’t use `pkg-config` to find openssl’s installation location.
* Add missing `--enable-local-libevent` help to top-level configure.
* Update `libevent --disable-libevent-regress` handling to work when building `libevent` using `mingw`.
* Fix `make distcheck` break in `libevent/sample` caused by typo.
* `libevent`: When building on systems with `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` available, separate the internal timeline (possibly counting since system boot) from the `gettimeofday()` timeline in `event_base` cached timevals. Adds new `event_base_tv_cached()` to retrieve cached callback round start time on the internal timeline, and changes `event_based_gettimeofday_cached()` to always return times using the namesake timeline. This preserves the benefit of using the never-stepped monotonic clock for event timeouts while providing clients with times consistently using `gettimeofday()`.
* Update to libopts-40.2.15.
* From 4.2.6p4: `libopts/file.c` fix from Bruce Korb (`arg-type=file`).
* Move `m4` directory to `sntp/m4`.
* Share a single set of `genver` output between `sntp` and the top level.
* Share a single set of `autogen` included `.defs` in `sntp/include`.
* Share a single set of `build-aux` scripts (e.g. `config.guess, missing`).
* Add `ntp_libntp.m4` and `ntp_ipv6.m4` to reduce `configure.ac` duplication.
* Warn and exit `build/flock-build` if bootstrap needs to be run.
* Update the building of OS-specific programs.
* Add `--enable-c99-sprintf` to configure args for `-noopenssl` variety of `flock-build` to avoid regressions in `(v)snprintf()` replacement.
* Add `--disable-thread-support` to one `flock-build` variation.
* Avoid invoking `config.status` twice in a row in build script.
* Correct `msyslog.c` build break on Solaris 2.9 from `#ifdef/#if` mixup.
* Correct `./build` on systems without `gtest` available.
* Use `make V=0` in build script to increase signal/noise ratio.
* Avoid race with parallel builds using same source directory in `scripts/genver` by using build directory for temporary files.
* From 4.2.6p1-RC6: Correct `SIMUL=4 ./flock-build -1` to prioritize `-1/--one`.
* Fix warnings seen on FreeBSD 9.
* Fix check for `-lipv6` on HP-UX 11.
* Fix for openssl `pkg-config` detection eval failure.
* `make V=0` and `configure --enable-silent-rules` supported.
* Default to silent `make` rules, override with `make V=1` or `./configure --disable-silent-rules`.
* Correct `--with-openssl-incdir` defaulting with `pkg-config`.
* Default `--with-openssl-libdir` and `--with-openssl-incdir` to the values from `pkg-config`, falling back on our usual search paths if `pkg-config` is not available or does not have `openssl.pc` on `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`.
* Avoid overwriting user variable `LDFLAGS` with OpenSSL flags, instead they are added to `LDFLAGS_NTP`.
* Cleanup to the new `scripts/*/Makefile.am` files.
* Fix the `check-scm-rev` invocation in several `Makefile.am`s.
* Incorporate Oliver Kindernay’s GSoC 2013 `scripts/` cleanup.
* from 4.2.6p3-RC8: First cut at using `scripts/checkChangeLog`.
* from 4.2.6p3-RC7: Added `scripts/checkChangeLog`.
* More cleanup to the bootstrap script.
* Handle additional man page sections in the bootstrap script.
* For the bootstrap script, touch `.html` files last.
* Add `make check` test case that would have caught [Bug 1678](https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1678).
* A number of compiler warnings eliminated.
* FlexeLint cleanups.
* Remove extra `nlist` check from `configure.ac`.
* Clean up `configure.ac`.
* Cleanup `configure.ac`’s `TSYNC PCI` section.
* from 4.2.6p3-RC12: Clean up `m4` quoting in `configure.ac, *.m4` files, resolving intermittent `AC_LANG_PROGRAM` possibly undefined errors.
* Clean up missing `;;` entries in `configure.ac`.
* `configure.ac`: add `--disable-autokey, #define AUTOKEY` to enable future support for building without Autokey, but with OpenSSL for its digest
  algorithms (hash functions). Code must be modified to use `#ifdef AUTOKEY` instead of `#ifdef OPENSSL` where appropriate to complete this.

---

**sntp**

* Improve `sntp` KoD data file `fopen()` error message.
* Fix `ntpsweep` to use `sntp` instead of `ntpdate`, from Oliver Kindernay.
* Bump `sntp/include/autogen-version.def`.
* `EEXIST` is OK for `mkdir()` in `sntp/kod_management.c`.
* Document a tricky `malloc()` of `dns_ctx` in `sntp`.
* Clean up testing/debugging of fix for [Bug 938](https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=938) from `sntp/main.c`.
* In `sntp/m4/ntp_openssl.m4`, Support multiple package names for the crypto library. Add legacy support for `-Wl,-rpath`.
* Change the link order for `ntpsntpd`.
* Update `sntp` tests to track the change of root dispersion to synchronization distance.
* Restore the original `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` output format in `sntp`.
* `sntp` documentation and behavior improvements suggested by Steven Sommars.
* Have `sntp` report synchronization distance instead of root dispersion.
* `sntp`: change `-h/--headspace` to `-g/--gap`, and change the default gap from 10 to 50ms
* **Backward Incompatible** from 4.2.6p4: `sntp: -l/--filelog` -> `-l/--logfile`, to be consistent with `ntpd`.
* remove old `binsubdir` stuff from SNTP, as `NTP_LOCINFO` does that now.
* Fix warnings in `ntp_request.c` [Bug 1973](https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1973) oversight and `sntp/main.c`.
  + (CID 159, apparent overrun due to union, actually correct).
* Rename file containing 1.xxxx ChangeSet revision from version to scm-rev to avoid invoking GNU make implicit rules attempting to compile `version.c` into version. Problem was with `sntp/version.o` during `make distcheck` after fix for spurious `sntp` rebuilds.
* Move `sntp` last in top-level `Makefile.am SUBDIRS` so that the `libevent` tearoff (if required) and `sntp` are compiled after the rest.
* Correct spurious `sntp` rebuilds triggered by a `make` misperception `sntp/version` was out-of-date relative to phony target `FRC.version`.
* Remove `libevent-cfg` from `sntp/Makefile.am`.
* Avoid relying on remake rules for routine `build/flock-build` for `libevent` as for the top-level and `sntp` subproject.
* Move “can’t write KoD file” warning from `sntp` shutdown to startup.
* Convert `sntp` to `libevent` event-driven socket programming. Instead of blocking name resolution and querying one NTP server at a time, resolve server names and send NTP queries without blocking. Add `sntp` command-line options to adjust timing and optionally wait for all servers to respond instead of exiting after the first.
* Move `init_logging(), change_logfile()`, and `setup_logfile()` from `ntpd` to `libntp`, use them in `sntp`.
* Test `--without-sntp` in `flock-build` script’s `-no-refclocks` variety.
* `sntp/Makefile.am` needs any passed-in `CFLAGS`.
* Simplify the built-sources stuff in `sntp/`.
* Add `configure --without-sntp` option to disable building `sntp` and `sntp/tests`. `withsntp=no` in the environment changes the default.
* Remove top-level `libopts`, use `sntp/libopts`.
* from 4.2.6p3-RC11: Remove `log_msg()` and `debug_msg()` from `sntp` in favor of `msyslog()`.
* Put the `sntp` tests under `sntp/` … and only build/run them if we have `gtest`.
* from 4.2.6p2-RC3: Do not depend on ASCII in `sntp`.
* Move `sntp/include/mansec2subst.sed` to `sntp/scripts/mansec2subst.sed`.
* Convert more of the `sntp-opt.def` documentation from `man` to `mdoc`.
* Share a single `sntp/libevent/build-aux` directory between all three `configure` scripts.
* Finish conversion to `genLocInfo`.
* validate `MANTAGFMT` in `genLocInfo`.
* `ntp_locs.m4`: handle the case where . is not in the `PATH`.
* More `genLocInfo` improvements and cleanup.
* Added `ntp_locs.m4`.
* Add the man page tag “flavor” to the `loc.*` files.
* Add/distribute `genLocInfo`.
* Create `loc/darwin` for Mac OSX.
* Added `loc/debian`.
* Added `loc.freebsd` (and distribute it).
* Added `loc.legacy` (and distribute it).
* Added `loc/redhat`.
* Added `loc/solaris`.
* Move `loc/` to `sntp/loc/`.
* Added `sntp/loc/netbsd` based on info from Christos Zoulas.
* Update `sntp/loc/solaris` to conform to stock locations.
* If no “more specific” `loc` file is found for redhat\* or fedora\*, look for a `loc/redhat` file.
* If no “more specific” `loc` file is found and `uname` says this is Linux, look for a `loc/linux` file.
* Implement `--with-locfile=filename configure` argument. If filename is empty we’ll look under `loc/` for a good fit. If the filename contains a `/` character, it will be treated as a “normal” pathname. Otherwise, that explicit file will be searched for under `loc/`.
* Removed `sntp/m4/ntp_bindir.m4` - no longer needed.
* Move `scripts/cvo.sh` to `sntp/scripts/cvo.sh`.
* Move `scripts/genLocInfo` to `sntp/scripts/genLocInfo`.
* Remove hacks to get `NTP_LOCINFO`-related data to `sntp/`.
* Remove `sntp l_fp_output()` test now that it uses `prettydate()`.
* Do not force “legacy” when `--with-locfile` is not given, `genLocInfo` will find the correct default for the system.
* **DEFAULT INSTALLATION DIRECTORY CHANGES ON SOME OSes:** to get the old behavior, pass `--with-locfile=legacy` to `configure`
* Give `NTP_LOCINFO` an optional `path-to` argument.
* Improve the help text: `--with-locfile=XXX`.
* work around solaris `/bin/sh` issues for `genLocInfo`.

---

**refclocks**

* `refclock_acts.c` updates and cleanup from Dave Mills.
* Move refclock-specific scheduled timer code under `#ifdef REFCLOCK` and move “action” and “nextaction” data for same from struct `peer` to
  struct `refclockproc`. These provide a way to schedule a callback some seconds in the future.
* ACTS refclock cleanup from Dave Mills.
* Use an enum for the ACTS state table.
* Apply `tos orphanwait` (def. 300 seconds) to LOCAL and ACTS reference clock drivers, in addition to orphan parent operation. LOCAL and ACTS are not selectable during the `orphanwait` delay at startup and after each `no_sys_peer` event. This prevents a particular form of clock-hopping, such as using LOCAL briefly at startup before remote peers are selectable. This fixes the issue reported in [Bug 988](https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=988).
* `setvar modemsetup = ATE0...` overrides ACTS driver default.
* Preserve last timecode in ACTS driver (`ntpq -ccv`).
* Tolerate previous ATE1 state when sending ACTS setup.
* Enable ACTS and CHU reference clock drivers on Windows.
* Use `acts_close()` in `acts_shutdown()` to avoid leaving a stale lockfile if unpeered via runtime configuration while the modem is open.
* Correct `acts_close()` test of pp->io.fd to see if it is open.
* `refclock_nmea.c` merge cleanup thanks to Juergen Perlinger.
* `refclock_nmea.c` refactoring by Juergen Perlinger.
* Conditionalize NMEA serial open message under `clockevent`.
* Change some error logging to `syslog` to ignore `logconfig` mask, such as reporting PPSAPI failure in NMEA and WWVB refclocks.
* Added support for Garmin’s `$PGRMF` sentence to NMEA driver.
* NMEA driver documentation update from Juergen Perlinger.
* From 4.2.6p1-RC6: Correct CHU, dumbclock, and WWVB drivers to check for 0 returned from `refclock_open()` on failure.
* Initialize `refclockproc.rio.fd` to -1, harmonize refclock shutdown entrypoints to avoid crashing, particularly if `refclock_open()` fails.
* Include 4.2.6p1: Fix widely cut-n-pasted bug in refclock shutdown after failed start.
* In `refclock_wwv.c` rename `SECOND` to `WWV_SEC` and `MINUTE` to `WWV_MIN`.
* Attempt to resolve strict-aliasing violation in `refclock_tsyncpci.c`.
* Add `refclock_tsyncpci.c` (driver 45) supporting Spectracom TSYNC timing boards.
* Fix && -> & typo in `refclock_palisade.c` debug statements.
* Log failure to fetch time from HOPF\_P hardware.
* Check `HOPF_S sscanf()` conversion count before converted values.
* JJY driver improvements for Tristate JJY01/02, including changes to its clockstats format.
* Remove never-used, incomplete `ports/winnt/ntpd/refclock_trimbledc`.[ch]
* Remove kernel line discipline driver code for clk and chu, deprecate related `LDISC_ flags`, and remove associated `ntpd` code to decode the timestamps, remove `clktest` line discipline test program.
* Compare entire timestamp to reject duplicates in `refclock_pps()`.
* Change `refclock_open()` to return -1 on failure like `open()`.
* Update all `refclock_open()` callers to check for fd <= 0 indicating failure, so they work with older and newer `refclock_open()` and can easily backport.

---

**ntpq**

* Add `ntpq reslist` command to query access restrictions, similar to `ntpdc`’s `reslist`.
* Disable mode 7 (`ntpdc`) query processing in `ntpd` by default. `ntpq` is believed to provide all functionality `ntpdc` did, and uses a less-fragile protocol that’s safer and easier to maintain. If you do find some management via `ntpdc` is needed, you can use `enable mode7` in the `ntpd` configuration.
* `ntpq mrulist` shows intermediate counts every five seconds while retrieving list, and allows `Ctrl-C` interruption of the retrieval, showing the incomplete list as retrieved. Reduce delay between successive mrulist retrieval queries from 30 to 5 msec. Do not give up mrulist retrieval when a single query times out.
* Add missing `break;` to `ntp_control.c ctl_putsys()` for caliberrs, used by `ntpq -c kerninfo` introduced in 4.2.7p104.
* Move `ntp_control.h` variable IDs to `ntp_control.c`, remove their use by `ntpq`. They are implementation details private to `ntpd`. [Bug 597](https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=597) was caused by `ntpq`’s reliance on these IDs it need not know about.
* Add `ntpq kerninfo, authinfo`, and `sysinfo` commands similar to `ntpdc`’s.
* Add `ntpq pstats` command similar to `ntpdc`’s.
* Remove `ntpq pstatus` command, `rv/readvar` does the same and more.
* Allow `ntpq &1 associd` use without preceding association-fetching.
* from 4.2.6p2-RC3: Escape unprintable characters in a refid in `ntpq -p` billboard.
* Add `ntpq -c iostats` similar to `ntpdc -c iostats`.
* Add `ntpq -c ifstats` similar to `ntpdc -c ifstats`.
* Add `ntpq -c sysstats` similar to `ntpdc -c sysstats`.
* Add `ntpq -c monstats` to show `monlist` knobs and stats.
* Add `ntpq -c mrulist` similar to `ntpdc -c monlist` but not limited to 600 rows, and with filtering and sorting options:
  + `ntpq -c "mrulist mincount=2 laddr=192.168.1.2 sort=-avgint"`
  + `ntpq -c "mrulist sort=addr"`
  + `ntpq -c "mrulist mincount=2 sort=count"`
  + `ntpq -c "mrulist sort=-lstint"`
* `ntpq`: increase response reassembly limit from 24 to 32 packets, add discussion in comment regarding results with even larger `MAXFRAGS`.
* `ntpq`: handle `passwd MYPASSWORD` (without prompting) as with `ntpdc`.
* Extend `ntpq readvar` (alias `rv`) to allow fetching up to three named variables in one operation: `ntpq -c "rv 0 version offset frequency"`.
* `ntpq`: use `srchost` variable to show .POOL. prototype associations' hostname instead of address 0.0.0.0.
* Clean up an exit status in `ntpq.c`.
* Remove 1024 associations-per-server limit from `ntpq`.
* Remove blank line between `ntpq mreadvar` associations.
* `ntpq autogen` docs.
* Produce `ntpq.1` with the new `autogen` macros.
* Fix nits in the `ntpq` man page.
* Cleanup to `ntpq.texi`.

---

**ntpdc**

* Remove the deprecated `detail` stanza from `ntpdc-opts.def`.
* Remove use of `MAXFILENAME` in mode 7 (`ntpdc`) on-wire structs.
* Limit `ntpdc -c monlist` response in `ntpd` to 600 entries, the previous overall limit on the MRU list depth which was driven by the monlist implementation limit of one request with a single multipacket response.
* `ntpdc`: do not examine argument to `passwd` if not supplied.
* `ntpdc` documentation fixes and cleanup.
* Note the deprecation of `ntpdc` in its documentation.

---

**ntp-keygen**

* `ntp-keygen` private key cipher default now triple-key triple DES CBC.
* `ntp-keygen -M` is intended to ignore all other defaults and options, so do not attempt to open existing Autokey host certificate before generating symmetric keys and terminating.
* Restore IFF, MV, and GQ identity parameter filename convention to `ntpkey_<scheme>par_<group/host>` in `ntpd`, matching `ntp-keygen`.
* **Backward Incompatible** `ntp-keygen -i` option long name changed from misleading `--issuer-name` to `--ident`.
* Change `ntpd MAXFILENAME` from 128 to 256 to match `ntp-keygen`.
* from 4.2.6p3-RC12: Suppress `ntp-keygen` OpenSSL version display for `--help, --version`, display both build and runtime OpenSSL versions when they differ.
* Add `ntp-keygen -l/--lifetime` to control certificate expiry.
* Create `ntp-keygen.{html,texi}`.
* `ntp-keygen autogen` documentation updates.

---

**Windows**

* Treat zero counter as indication of precise system time in Windows PPSAPI helper function `pps_ntp_timestamp_from_counter()`, enabling PPSAPI providers to use the Windows 8 precise clock directly.
* Use `GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime()` on Windows 8.
* `ntp-keygen` on Windows XP and later systems will now create links expected by `ntpd`. They are hardlinks on Windows, soft on POSIX.
* Force `.exe` minimum Windows version to 0x0400 to allow NT4 in `vs2005/*.vcproj` files.
* Use `_mkgmtime()` as `timegm()` in the Windows port, rather than `libntp/mktime.c`’s `timegm()`. Fixed [Bug 1875](https://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1875) on Windows using the old `asn2ntp()` code from before 4.2.7p147.
* Provide fallback definitions for `GetAdaptersAddresses()` for Windows build environments lacking `iphlpapi.h`.
* Enable `tickadj`-like taming of wildly off-spec Windows clock using `NTPD_TICKADJ_PPM` env. var. specifying baseline slew.
* Enable raw `tty` line discipline in Windows port.
* Allow `tty` open/close/open to succeed on Windows port.
* Enable generating `ntpd/ntp_keyword.h` after `keyword-gen.c` changes on Windows as well as POSIX platforms.
* from 4.2.6p2-RC5: Windows port: do not exit in `ntp_timestamp_from_counter()` without first logging the reason.
* From 4.2.6p1-RC6: Correct Windows port’s `refclock_open()` to return 0 on failure not -1.
* Windows compiling `hints/winnt.html` update from G. Sunil Tej.

---

**Linux**

* Eliminate warnings about shadowing global “basename” on Linux.
* Remove `signal_no_reset: signal 17 had flags 4000000` logging, as it indicates no problem and is interpreted as an error. Previously some bits had been ignored one-by-one, but Linux `SA_RESTORER` definition is unavailable to user headers.

---

**unit tests**

* Add unit tests for `msnprintf()`.
* Add more unit tests for `timeval_tostr()` and `timespec_tostr()`.
* Fix `tvalops.cpp` unit test failures for 32-bit builds.
* Unit tests extended for hard-coded system time.

---

* Pass the configuration source into the parser as argument rather than through a global variable.
* Quiet warnings from `ntp_calendar.h`: avoid using argument names.

* Cleanup `kclk_sel240x.o` rules in `libparse/Makefile.am`.
* Conditionalize `msyslog` messages about rejected mode 6 requests due to `nomodify` and `nomrulist` restrictions under `logconfig +sysinfo`.
* Increment `sys_restricted` in a few rejection paths due to `nomodify` restrictions where previosuly overlooked.
* `tickadj` may need to be linked with `PTHREAD_LIBS`.
* `U_INT32_MAX` cleanup in `include/ntp_types.h`.
* When linking, `ntp_keygen` and `tickadj` need `$(LIBM)`.
* Correct `authnumfreekeys` accounting broken in 4.2.7p262.
* `LCRYPTO` is gone - replace with `VER_SUFFIX`.
* Improve `ntpd` scalability for servers with many trusted keys.
* Update one of the license URLs.
* Fix build break triggered by updating `deps-ver` and `libntp/systime.c` at the same time by explicitly depending `systime_s.c` on `systime.c`.
* Refactor `timespecops.h` and `timevalops.h` into inline functions.
* Floor peer delay using system precision, as with jitter, reflecting inability to measure shorter intervals.
* from 4.2.6p5-RC3: Ensure NULL peer->dstadr is not accessed in orphan parent selection.
* from 4.2.6p5-RC2: Exclude not-yet-determined `sys_refid` from use in loopback TEST12 (from Dave Mills).
* from 4.2.6p5-RC2: Never send KoD rate limiting response to `MODE_SERVER`.
* Floor calculation of `sys_rootdisp` at `sys_mindisp` in `clock_update` (from Dave Mills).
* Restore 4.2.6 `clock_combine()` weighting to ntp-dev, reverting to pre-4.2.7p70 method while also avoiding divide-by-zero (from Dave Mills).
* Round `l_fp` traffic interval when converting to integer in rate limit and KoD calculation.
* Clean up `-libm` entries regarding `libntp.a`
* Update the `NEWS` file so we note the default disable of mode 7 requests.
* Clean up some bitrotted code in libntp/socket.c.
* Directly limit the number of datagrams in a `mrulist` response, rather than limiting the number of entries returned to indirectly limit the datagram count.
* Log signal description along with number on `ntpd` exit.
* Send all peer variables to trappers in `report_event()`.
* Fix the `CLOCK_MONOTONIC TRACE()` message.
* Cleanups for `ntp-wait-opts.def` and `ntp.keys.def`.
* Actually use long long for `(u_)int64` by correcting spelling of `SIZEOF_LONG_LONG` in `ntp_types.h`.
* Correct `init_logging()`’s `def_syslogmask` type to `u_int32` following change of `ntp_syslogmask` from `u_long` to `u_int32` in p202.
* Add support for installing programs and scripts to `libexec`.
* Match `addr_eqprefix() sizeof` and `memcpy` destination to make it clear to static analysis that there is no buffer overrun (CID 402).
* `ntp-wait`: some versions of `ntpd` spell `associd` differently.
* Update `.point-changed-filelist` for the new man pages.
* Update `.point-changed-filelist`.
* Upgrade local `autoopts` templates to 5.11.10pre5.
* Update the `std_def_list` to include the `ntp.lic` file.
* Distribute the `ntp.lic` file.
* Add ntp.org/license to the `ntp.lic` file.
* Clean up the `ntp.lic` file.
* Typo in `emalloc.c` hides file and line number from `emalloc()` error msg.
* `parsesolaris.c` compile fails on SPARC Solaris with conflicting `printf`.
* `ntp_util.c` compile fails on AIX and OSF with conflicting `statsdir`.
* Remove hardcoded 1/960 s. fudge for `<CR>` transmission time at 9600 8n1 from WWVB/Spectracom driver introduced in 4.2.7p169.
* Use `filegen_config()` consistently when changing `filegen` options.
* `mprintf()` should go to `stdout`, not `stderr. DPRINTF()` uses `mprintf()`.
* Repair a few simulator problems (more remain).
* Use 64-bit scalars in `LFPTOD()` and `DTOLFP()` on more platforms by conditionalizing on `HAVE_U_INT64` rather than `UINT64_MAX`.
* Convert receive buffer queue from doubly-linked list to FIFO.
* Change `pool DNS` messages from `msyslog` to debug trace output.
* Remove unused `FLAG_SYSPEER` from peer->status.
* Respect `tos orphanwait` at startup. Previously there was an unconditional 300 s. startup `orphanwait`, though other values were respected for subsequent orphan wait periods after `no_sys_peer` events.
* Fix a couple of unused variable warnings.
* cleanup in `timespecops.c / timevalops.c`
* Fix leak in `refclock_datum.c` start failure path.

* Detect `vsnprintf()` support for `%m` and disable our `%m` expansion.
* On systems without C99-compliant `(v)snprintf()`, use `C99-snprintf` [replacements](http://www.jhweiss.de/software/snprintf.html)
* Remove remaining `sprintf()` calls except `refclock_ripencc.c` (which is kept out of `--enable-all-clocks` as a result), upstream libs which use `sprintf()` only after careful buffer sizing.
* `ntp_crypto.c` string buffer safety.
* Buffer safety and sign extension fixes (thanks Coverity Scan).
* String buffer safety cleanup, converting to `strlcpy()` and `strlcat()`.
* Use `utmpname()` before `pututline()` so repeated steps do not accidentally record into `wtmp` where `utmp` was intended.
* Use `setutent()` before each `pututline()` including first.
* One more lock-while-init in `lib/isc/task.c` to quiet lock analysis.
* Use `TRACE()` instead of `DPRINTF()` for `libntp` and utilities, which use the `debug` variable regardless of `#ifdef DEBUG`.
* Declare `debug` in `libntp` instead of each program. Expose extern declaration to utilities, `libntp`, and `DEBUG ntpd`.
* Lock under-construction task, taskmgr objects to satisfy Coverity’s mostly-correct assumptions about which variables are protected by which locks.
* Ensure `CONFIG_SHELL` is not empty before relying on it for `#!` scripts.
* Add `INC_ALIGNED_PTR()` macro to align pointers like `malloc()`.
* Do not cache paths to `perl, test`, or `pkg-config`, searching the `PATH` at configure time is worth it to pick up tool updates.
* ElectricFence was suffering bitrot - remove it. `valgrind` works well.
* Correct Solaris 2.1x `PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT` extra braces test to avoid triggering warnings due to excess braces.
* Provide bug report and URL options to Autoconf.
* older `autoconf` sometimes dislikes `[]`.
* Move blocking worker and resolver to `libntp` from `ntpd`.
* Use threads rather than forked child processes for blocking worker when possible. Override with `configure --disable-thread-support`.
* Move more `m4sh` tests needed by `libntp` to shared `.m4` files.
* Split up `ntp_libntp.m4` into smaller, more specific subsets.
* Enable `gcc -Wcast-align`, fix many instances of warnings when casting a pointer to a more-strictly-aligned underlying type.
* Fix leak in `ntp_control.c read_mru_list()`.
* Fix unexposed fencepost error in `format_time_fraction()`.
* Avoid shadowing the `group` global variable.
* Change new `timeval` and `timespec` to string routines to use `snprintf()` rather than hand-crafted conversion, avoid signed int overflow there.
* Add configure support for `SIZEOF_LONG_LONG` to enable portable use of `snprintf()` with `time_t`.
* Grow `ntpd/work_thread.c` arrays as needed.
* Add `DEBUG_*` variants of `ntp_assert.h` macros which compile away using `./configure --disable-debugging`.
* Return to a single `autoreconf` invocation in `./bootstrap` script.
* crypto group changes from Dave Mills.
* Lose the `RANGEGATE` check in PPS, from Dave Mills.
* added `timespecops.{c,h}` and `tievalops.{c.h}` to `libntp` and include added `tspecops.cpp` to `tests/libntp`
* Add `erealloc_zero()`, refactor `estrdup(), emalloc(), emalloc_zero()` to separate tracking callsite file/line from using debug MS C runtime, and to reduce code duplication.
* Begin moving some of the low-level socket stuff to `libntp`.
* Remove nearly all `strcpy()` and most `strcat()` from NTP distribution.
  + One major pocket remains in `ntp_crypto.c. libopts` & `libisc` also have (safe) uses of `strcpy()` and `strcat()` remaining.
* Autokey multiple identity group improvements from Dave Mills.
* from 4.2.6p3: Update `genCommitLog` for the bk-5 release.
* from 4.2.6p3: Update `bk` triggers for the bk-5 release.
* Support for multiple Autokey identity groups from Dave Mills.
* from 4.2.6p3-RC12: Other `manycastclient` repairs:
  + Separate handling of scope ID embedded in many `in6_addr` from `ifindex` used for IPv6 multicasting ioctls.
  + Add `INT_PRIVACY` endpt bit flag for IPv6 [RFC 4941](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4941) privacy addresses.
  + Enable outbound multicast from only one address per interface in the same subnet, and in that case prefer embedded MAC address modified EUI-64 IPv6 addresses first, then static, and last [RFC 4941](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4941) privacy addresses.
  + Use `setsockopt(IP[V6]_MULTICAST_IF)` before each send to multicast to select the local source address, using the correct socket is not enough.
* `server ... ident <groupname>` changes from Dave Mills.
* An almost complete rebuild of the initial loopfilter configuration process, including the code that determines the interval between frequency file updates, from Dave Mills.
* Add `nonvolatile ntp.conf` directive to control how often the `driftfile` is written.
* Correct frequency estimate with no drift file, from David Mills.
* Refactor calendar functions in terms of new common code.
* Include Linus Karlsson’s GSoC 2010 testing code.
* refinements to new startup behavior from David Mills.
* Fix from Dave Mills for a rare singularity in `clock_combine()`.
* Remove unused `bias` configuration keyword.
* Remove `calldelay` and `sign` remnants from parser, `ntp_config.c`.
* from 4.2.6p3: `ntpsnmpd, libntpq` warning cleanup.
* Remove `calldelay` and `sign` keywords (Dave Mills).
* Lose peer\_count from `ntp_peer.c` and `ntp_proto.c` (Dave Mills).
* Variable name cleanup from Dave Mills.
* Clock select bugfix from Dave Mills.
* Clock combining algorithm improvements from Dave Mills.
* More Initial convergence improvements from Dave Mills.
* Cleanup `NTP_LIB_M`.
* Use `AC_SEARCH_LIBS` instead of `AC_CHECK_LIB` for `NTP_LIB_M`.
* Typo fix in a comment in `ntp_proto.c`.
* `clock_filter()`/reachability fixes from Dave Mills.
* Rewrite of multiprecision macros in `ntp_fp.h` from J. Perlinger
* `include/ntp_crypto.h`: make assumption `AUTOKEY` implies `OPENSSL` explicit.
* from 4.2.6p2-RC3: Simplify hash client code by providing `OpenSSL EVP_*()` API when built without OpenSSL. (already in 4.2.7)
* Update the `ChangeLog` entries when merging items from -stable.
* Modify full MRU list preemption when full to match `discard monitor` documentation, by removing exception for `count == 1`.
* `ntpdate`: stop querying source after KoD packet response, log it.
* `ntpdate`: rate limit each server to 2s between packets.
* From J. N. Perlinger: avoid pointer wraparound warnings in `dolfptoa(), printf` format mismatches with 64-bit `size_t`.
* Broadcast client (ephemeral) associations should be demobilized only if they are not heard from for 10 consecutive polls, regardless of surviving the clock selection. Fix from David Mills.
* Modify internal representation of MRU list to use `l_fp` fixed-point NTP timestamps instead of seconds since startup. This increases the resolution and substantially improves accuracy of sorts involving timestamps, at the cost of flushing all MRU entries when the clock is stepped, to ensure the timestamps can be compared with the current `get_systime()` results.
* Add `ntp.conf mru` directive to configure MRU parameters, such as `mru mindepth 600 maxage 64 maxdepth 5000 maxmem 1024` or `mru initalloc 0 initmem 16 incalloc 99 incmem 4`. Several pairs are equivalent with one in units of MRU entries and its twin in units of kilobytes of memory, so the last one used in `ntp.conf` controls: `maxdepth/maxmem, initalloc/initmem, incalloc/incmem`. With the above values, `ntpd` will preallocate 16kB worth of MRU entries, allocating 4kB worth each time more are needed, with a hard limit of 1MB of MRU entries. Until there are more than 600 entries none would be reused. Then only entries for addresses last seen 64 seconds or longer ago are reused.
* New `pool` directive implementation modeled on `manycastclient`.
* Do not abort on non-ASCII characters in `ntp.conf`, ignore them.
* `configure`: remove check for pointer type used with `qsort()`, we require ANSI C which mandates `void *`.
* Reset `sys_kodsent` to 0 in `proto_clr_stats()`.
* Add `sptoa()/sockporttoa()` similar to `stoa()/socktoa()` adding `:port`.
* Use `memcpy()` instead of `memmove()` when buffers can not overlap.
* Remove `sockaddr_storage` from our `sockaddr_u union` of `sockaddr, sockaddr_in`, and `sockaddr_in6`, shaving about 100 bytes from its size and substantially decreasing MRU entry memory consumption.
* `restrict source ...` configures override restrictions for time sources, allows tight default restrictions to be used with the pool directive (where server addresses are not known in advance).
* Ignore `preempt` modifier on `manycastclient` and `pool` prototype associations. The resulting associations are preemptible, but the prototype must not be.
* Maintain and use linked list of associations (`struct peer`) in `ntpd`, avoiding walking 128 hash table entries to iterate over peers.
* Remove more workarounds unneeded since we require ISO C90 AKA ANSI C:
  + remove fallback implementations for `memmove(), memset, strstr()`.
  + do not test for `atexit()` or `memcpy()`.
* Collapse a bunch of code duplication in `ntpd/ntp_restrict.c` added with support for IPv6.
* Correct some corner case failures in automatically enabling the MRU list if any `restrict ... limited` is in effect, and in disabling MRU maintenance. (`ntp_monitor.c, ntp_restrict.c`)
* Reverse the internal sort order of the address restriction lists, but preserve the same behavior. This allows removal of special-case code related to the default restrictions and more straightforward lookups of restrictions for a given address (now, stop on first match).
* Move `ntp_restrict.c` MRU doubly-linked list maintenance code into `ntp_lists.h` macros, allowing more duplicated source excision.
* Repair `ntpdate.c` to no longer test `HAVE_TIMER_SETTIME`.
* Do not reference peer\_node/unpeer\_node after freeing when built with `--disable-saveconfig` and using DNS.
* Use all addresses for each restrict by hostname.
* Use async DNS to resolve trap directive hostnames.
* Stop using `getaddrinfo()` to convert numeric address strings to on-wire addresses in favor of `is_ip_address()` alone.
* Attempts to cure CID 108 CID 118 CID 119 `TAINTED_SCALAR` warnings.
* Broaden `ylwrap` workaround `VPATH_HACK` to all non-GNU `make`.
* Include 4.2.6p1: Convert many `sprintf()` calls to `snprintf()`, also `strcpy(), strcat()`.
* Include 4.2.6p1: Remove some dead code checking for `emalloc()` returning NULL.
* New async DNS resolver in `ntpd` allows nonblocking queries anytime, instead of only once at startup.
* Include 4.2.6p1-RC3: Use `TZ=UTC` instead of `TZ=` when calling `date` in `scripts/mkver.in`.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-27 10:47:01 UTC  ``` Robin Park and Dmitri Vinokurov of Alcatel-Lucent discovered a flaw in the way ntpd handles certain mode 7 packets.  A remote attacker able to send specially-crafted mode 7 NTP packet with a spoofed source IP address could cause ntpd running on one host, or two ntpds running on two hosts to send error packets in loop, resulting in excessive use of CPU and disk space (via logging).  Issue is tracked by US-CERT as VU#568372.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-27 10:52:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 366233](attachment.cgi?id=366233&action=diff "Upstream patch to be included in 4.2.4p8") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=366233&action=edit "Upstream patch to be included in 4.2.4p8") Upstream patch to be included in 4.2.4p8   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-02 20:07:12 UTC  ``` Impact and mitigations: - mode 7 NTP packets are processed by ntpd when they have source IP which is   allowed to query - when malformed mode 7 packet is received, ntpd sends back a reply packet   (using mode 7 again), this reply packet, when received by other ntpd,   triggers similar reply (resulting in reply loop among the two ntp hosts) - ntpd implements a check that prevents it from replying to packets with   source IP:port matching any of the local network interfaces on which ntpd   listens; this mitigates single host reply loops, but they may still be   possible to trigger using loopback addresses - excessive disk usage is mitigated by the way syslogd reports duplicate   messages (message is recorded once and repeat count is recorded when the   next different message is received); this mitigation may be minimized   during the multiple parallel attacks - single host reply loops using loopback addresses can be blocked by   dropping all packets with source addresses 127/8 not received via   loopback interface (via netfilter rule or rp_filter settings) - mode 7 packets are normally generated by ntpdc - ntpd query and   configuration command.  packets from ntpdc normally do not have source   port 123, so mode 7 NTP packets with source port 123 should be considered   suspicious. - netfilter module u32 can match mode 7 NTP packets using a check as:    --u32 "0>>22&0x3C@8>>24&0x7=7"   u32 module is, however, not included in kernel packages for current   Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions   note: this check needs to be combined with other check (udp packet, source /   destination port 123) - it's possible to mitigate this attack using recent netfilter module by   limiting maximum amount of NTP packets allowed to be received from single   IP address during the specified time period (break reply loops)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c8)  Vincent Danen    2009-12-08 18:45:20 UTC  ``` This is public now:  <https://lists.ntp.org/pipermail/announce/2009-December/000086.html>  and:  <https://support.ntp.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1331>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-08 19:33:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1648 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1648.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-08 19:50:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:1651 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1651.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c12)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-09 11:59:58 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p8-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ntp-4.2.4p8-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c13)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-09 12:03:46 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p7-3.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ntp-4.2.4p7-3.fc11>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c14)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-09 12:05:02 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p7-2.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ntp-4.2.4p7-2.fc10>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c15)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-11 18:14:23 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p8-1.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## NTP mode 7 denial-of-service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#568372

Original Release Date: 2009-12-08 | Last Revised: 2011-07-22

---

### Overview

NTP contains a vulnerability in the handling of mode 7 requests, which can result in a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| NTP mode 7 (MODE\_PRIVATE) is used by the ntpdc query and control utility. In contrast, ntpq uses NTP mode 6 (MODE\_CONTROL), while routine NTP time transfers use modes 1 through 5. Upon receipt of an incorrect mode 7 request or a mode 7 error response from an address that is not listed in a "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" segment, ntpd will reply with a mode 7 error response and log a message.  If an attacker spoofs the source address of ntpd host A in a mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host B, both A and B will continuously send each other error responses, for as long as those packets get through.If an attacker spoofs an address of ntpd host A in a mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host A, then host A will respond to itself endlessly, consuming CPU and logging excessively. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service condition on a vulnerable NTP server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in NTP 4.2.4p8. Please check with your vendor for an update, or you may download [NTP 4.2.4p8 from ntp.org](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html). |
| --- |

| **Configure NTP to limit source addresses**By using "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" entries in the ntp.conf file, ntpd can be configured to limit the source addresses to which it will respond.**Filter NTP mode 7 packets that specify source and destination port 123**In most cases, ntpdc mode 7 requests will have either a source or destination port of 123, but not both.**Use anti-spoofing IP address filters**[RFC 2827 (BCP 38)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2827) describes network ingress filtering, which can prevent UDP traffic claiming to be from a local address from entering your network from an outside source. Some ISPs may employ unicast reverse path filtering ([uRPF](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3704)) to limit the spoofed traffic that can enter your network. |

| [Description](#c0)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-10-28 13:56:42 UTC  ``` ** Please note that this issue is confidential and no information should be disclosed until it is made public, see "Whiteboard" for a date **  Robin Park and Dmitri Vinokurov of Alcatel-Lucent reported a Denial of Service vulnerability in ntp before 4.2.4p8 (to be released). Quoting CERT:  NTP mode 7 (MODE_PRIVATE) is used by the ntpdc query and control utility. In contrast, ntpq uses NTP mode 6 (MODE_CONTROL), while routine NTP time transfers use modes 1 through 5. Upon receipt of an incorrect mode 7 request or a mode 7 error response from an address which is not listed in a "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" statement, ntpd will reply with a mode 7 error response (and log a message). In this case: o If an attacker spoofs the source address of ntpd host A in a mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host B, both A and B will continuously send each other error responses, for as long as those packets get through. o If an attacker spoofs an address of ntpd host A in a mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host A, A will respond to itself endlessly, consuming CPU and logging excessively. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-10-28 13:58:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 208517](attachment.cgi?id=208517 "ntp-4.2.4_p7-CVE-2009-3563.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=208517&action=edit "ntp-4.2.4_p7-CVE-2009-3563.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=208517&action=diff "ntp-4.2.4_p7-CVE-2009-3563.patch")] ntp-4.2.4_p7-CVE-2009-3563.patch ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-10-28 14:08:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 208519](attachment.cgi?id=208519 "ntp-4.2.4_p7-r1.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=208519&action=edit "ntp-4.2.4_p7-r1.ebuild")] ntp-4.2.4_p7-r1.ebuild ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-10-28 14:10:12 UTC  ``` Arch Security Liaisons, please test the attached ebuild and report it stable on this bug.

I'm not very keen to analyse your network problems in my free time. To your very great suprise, others members from the security team will most likely feel the same way.  b) If you want fixed timeframes in which your problems are solved, I suggest you buy a distro with professional support (RHEL or SLES) and do not run a distribution that is run by volunteers in their free time.  c) You're free to become a developer yourself or to get out strace & gdb. If you're not able to do that, you might consider calling a consultant that can fix your problems.  d) Don't forget that you neither payed anything, nor did gentoo promise you anything; you cannot scare anyone by saying you will use Debian or BSD. Why should anyone care at all? It will rather make everyone laugh.  e) I will not touch this bug for one month from now on, so that you have enough time to think about b) (or analyse your problems yourself). Writing this has already been a waste of time, I will not take part in any further discussion about the whole issue and am not available until 07th march.  ``` |  |

ntp security update (RHSA-2009-1648)

Original Release Date: January 4, 2010

Last Revised: April 19, 2013

Number: ASA-2009-591

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time
with a referenced time source.

A flaw was discovered in the way ntpd handled certain malformed NTP packets.
ntpd logged information about all such packets and replied with an NTP packet
that was treated as malformed when received by another ntpd. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to create an NTP packet reply loop between two ntpd servers
via a malformed packet with a spoofed source IP address and port, causing ntpd
on those servers to use excessive amounts of CPU time and fill disk space with
log messages. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name
[CVE-2009-3563](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3563) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly
recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
recommended action is applied. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying

applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

The vulnerability is due to an error in handling certain malformed messages. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could send a malicious NTP packet with a spoofed source IP address to a vulnerable host. Once the host processes the packet, it could send a similar packet to another NTP host. This action could start a message loop between both hosts that could cause them to consume excessive CPU resources and disk space writing messages to log files. These two conditions could cause a DoS condition on the affected hosts.  Functional exploit code is available.  NTP.org has confirmed this vulnerability in a changelog and released updated software.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=490617#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-03-17 10:44:46 UTC  ``` Apple Security Team reported a stack buffer overflow exists in the ntpq program.  When the ntpq program is used to request peer information from a remote time server, a maliciously crafted response may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.  Problem exists in cookedprint() function in ntpq.c, when server-supplied numeric value is sprintf-ed to the buffer that is not large enough to hold string representation of the maximum possible value.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=490617#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2009-03-17 10:45:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 335503](attachment.cgi?id=335503&action=diff "Patch proposed by Apple") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=335503&action=edit "Patch proposed by Apple") Patch proposed by Apple   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=490617#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-03-17 11:02:12 UTC  ``` This issue only affects ntpq diagnostic tool, not the NTP server.  Overflow can be triggered by malicious server being queried using ntpq, or if attacker is able to control communication channel between ntpq and the NTP server, and hence spoof malicious replies for queries to trusted NTP server.  Queries to trusted server using untrusted NTP peer are not affected.  Affected code is only reached when ntpq is using "cooked" output mode (which is default).  Always using "raw" output mode mitigates this problem.  The overflow itself is limited to 2 bytes (due to the maximum possible value that ntpq can read to uval) - one byte is an ascii representation of the attacker-controlled octal value '0' - '7', followed by a NULL byte.  ntpq is most commonly used to query ntpd running on the local machine (hence trusted).  localhost is the default host it queries unless some other host was explicitly specified.  Default ntpd server configuration only allows ntpq queries from localhosts too.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later (including current Fedora versions), this overflow is caught by _FORTIFY_SOURCE, causing ntpq to abort instead of overflowing the buffer.  For those versions, this is not a security flaw.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=490617#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2009-03-31 06:45:32 UTC  ``` Upstream bug report:   <https://support.ntp.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1144>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=490617#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2009-04-03 13:52:28 UTC  ``` The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=490617#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2009-04-09 10:11:01 UTC  ``` Public now, fixed upstream in 4.2.4p7-RC2:   <https://support.ntp.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1144>   <http://ntp.bkbits.net:8080/ntp-stable/?PAGE=gnupatch&REV=1.1565>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=490617#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-05-18 20:35:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1039 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1039.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=490617#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-05-18 20:54:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2009:1040 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1040.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=490617#c12)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-19 16:22:24 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p7-1.fc9 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 9. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ntp-4.2.4p7-1.fc9>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=490617#c13)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-19 16:23:15 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p7-1.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ntp-4.2.4p7-1.fc10>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=490617#c14)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-30 02:28:06 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p7-1.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

Hi,
the following CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) id was
published for ntp.

[CVE-2009-3563](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3563)[0]:
| The topology used includes two nodes running ntp and an attacker's PC:
|
| PC--->  [node1 ntpd1]:11.0.0.1 --------11.0.0.2:[node2 ntpd2]
|
| PC sends one crafted UDP packet with one byte payload 0x17, i.e. NTP Request in
| mode 7.
| This UDP packet has spoofed source IP of 11.0.0.2, destination = 11.0.0.1,
| source port 123 and destination port 123.
| Node1 responds with mode 7 Error Response to Node2, and here comes something we
| cannot conceive. Ntpd2 responds back with the same mode 7 Error Response to
| Node1, Ntpd1 does again the same, etc. with the aggregate rate of few thousand
| pps. CPU is taken away on both sides, network is busy...
| Better yet, if we spoof the Node1's address 11.0.0.1 as a source, Node1 sends
| all these packets to itself all the time! Endless.
| Payload "97 00 00 00" (Response mode 7) works too.
| If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
| CVE id in your changelog entry.

Upstream has release 4.2.4p8 to fix this issue.

Severity: normal
Tags: patch
User: ubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com

In Ubuntu, we've applied the attached patch to achieve the following:

  * SECURITY UPDATE: fix DoS with mode 7 (MODE_PRIVATE) packets
    - debian/patches/CVE-2009-3563.patch: update ntpd/ntp_request.c to
      not send a response packet for and rate limit logging of invalid mode 7
      requests and responses
    - [CVE-2009-3563](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3563)

We thought you might be interested in doing the same. Here are a couple
more references:
<https://support.ntp.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1331>
<http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#DoS_attack_from_certain_NTP_mode>

The attached patch should work fine going back to etch as well (with a
little fuzz), as we used it as far back as ntp-4.2.0a+stable.

# Security

##### Notification Policy

When we discover a security vulnerability in NTP we follow our Phased Vulnerability Process which includes first notifying Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally making a public announcement.

[Institutional Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive advanced notification of security vulnerabilities.

##### Security Patch Policy

When security patches are ready, they are first given to Premier and Partner Institutional members of the [NTP Consortium at Network Time Foundation](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/), then access instructions are provided to [CERT](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/cert/index.cfm), and finally the public release is made on the embargo date.

[Premier and Partner Members](https://www.nwtime.org/membership/benefits/#institutional-consortia-memberships) receive early access to security patches.

##### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability in the NTP codebase, please report it by **PGP-encrypted** email to the NTF Security Officer Team. You can use our [NTF Security Officer PGP Key](https://www.nwtime.org/about/documents/NTFSecurityOfficerPGPKey.txt). Please refrain from discussing potential security issues in any mailing lists or public forums.

**NOTE:** Non-code vulnerabilities (such as a website issue) should instead be reported to webmaster. Issues for subdomains of "pool.ntp.org" should be reported to the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/mailinglists.html).

NTP contains a vulnerability in the handling of mode 7 requests, which can result in a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| NTP mode 7 (MODE\_PRIVATE) is used by the ntpdc query and control utility. In contrast, ntpq uses NTP mode 6 (MODE\_CONTROL), while routine NTP time transfers use modes 1 through 5. Upon receipt of an incorrect mode 7 request or a mode 7 error response from an address that is not listed in a "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" segment, ntpd will reply with a mode 7 error response and log a message.  If an attacker spoofs the source address of ntpd host A in a mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host B, both A and B will continuously send each other error responses, for as long as those packets get through.If an attacker spoofs an address of ntpd host A in a mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host A, then host A will respond to itself endlessly, consuming CPU and logging excessively. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service condition on a vulnerable NTP server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in NTP 4.2.4p8. Please check with your vendor for an update, or you may download [NTP 4.2.4p8 from ntp.org](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html). |
| --- |

| **Configure NTP to limit source addresses**By using "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" entries in the ntp.conf file, ntpd can be configured to limit the source addresses to which it will respond.**Filter NTP mode 7 packets that specify source and destination port 123**In most cases, ntpdc mode 7 requests will have either a source or destination port of 123, but not both.**Use anti-spoofing IP address filters**[RFC 2827 (BCP 38)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2827) describes network ingress filtering, which can prevent UDP traffic claiming to be from a local address from entering your network from an outside source. Some ISPs may employ unicast reverse path filtering ([uRPF](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3704)) to limit the spoofed traffic that can enter your network. |

# CVE-2009-3563

| **Name** | CVE-2009-3563 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | ntp\_request.c in ntpd in NTP before 4.2.4p8, and 4.2.5, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and bandwidth consumption) by using MODE\_PRIVATE to send a spoofed (1) request or (2) response packet that triggers a continuous exchange of MODE\_PRIVATE error responses between two NTP daemons. |

NTP users are strongly urged to take immediate action to ensure that their NTP daemons are not susceptible to being used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Please also take this opportunity to defeat denial-of-service attacks by [implementing Ingress and Egress filtering through BCP38](http://www.bcp38.info/index.php/Main_Page "BCP38 Ingress/Egress filtering").

`ntp-4.2.8p18` was released on 25 May 2024 and addresses 40 bugs and provides 40 improvements.

Please see the [NTP 4.2.8p18 Changelog](https://www.ntp.org/support/securitynotice/4_2_8-series-changelog/#428p18 "4.2.8p18 Changelog") for details.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=133#c0)  Frederick Bruckman    2003-06-20 16:18:49 UTC  ``` On NetBSD from NetBSD 1.5 to NetBSD 1.6.1, getaddrinfo() returned  EAI_NODATA in some cases where RFC's 2553 (and now 3493) required EAI_NONAME. Allow for that. The error was pulled in from the Kame project, so other platforms may be affected as well. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=133#c1)  Frederick Bruckman    2003-06-20 16:20:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 22](attachment.cgi?id=22&action=diff "Allow for possible non-standard behavior of getaddrinfo().")

## Synopsis

Moderate: ntp security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1648)

## Topic

An updated ntp package that fixes a security issue is now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with a referenced time source.

Robin Park and Dmitri Vinokurov discovered a flaw in the way ntpd handled
certain malformed NTP packets. ntpd logged information about all such
packets and replied with an NTP packet that was treated as malformed when
received by another ntpd. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create
an NTP packet reply loop between two ntpd servers via a malformed packet
with a spoofed source IP address and port, causing ntpd on those servers to
use excessive amounts of CPU time and fill disk space with log messages.
(CVE-2009-3563)

All ntp users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing the
update, the ntpd daemon will restart automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes security issues and several
bugs is now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
(RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the IPv6 Extension Header (EH) handling
implementation in the Linux kernel. The skb->dst data structure was not
properly validated in the ipv6\_hop\_jumbo() function. This could possibly
lead to a remote denial of service. (CVE-2007-4567)

The Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team reported two flaws in the routing
implementation. If an attacker was able to cause a large enough number of
collisions in the routing hash table (via specially-crafted packets) for
the emergency route flush to trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if
the kernel routing cache was disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be
left behind after a route lookup, leading to a kernel panic.
(CVE-2009-4272)

A flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in
the Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using packets larger
than the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in
partial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws
could also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.
(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538)

A flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel.
Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network cards
supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of
service. (CVE-2009-4537)

The x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current
Privilege Level (CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL). A user in a guest
could leverage these flaws to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or
possibly escalate their privileges within that guest. (CVE-2010-0298,
CVE-2010-0306)

A flaw was found in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation. Access
to the internal data structure pit\_state, which represents the data state
of the emulated PIT, was not properly validated in the pit\_ioport\_read()
function. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2010-0309)

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2006-6304, CVE-2009-2910,
CVE-2009-3080, CVE-2009-3556, CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, CVE-2009-4020,
CVE-2009-4021, CVE-2009-4138, and CVE-2009-4141; ntp issue CVE-2009-3563;
dbus issue CVE-2009-1189; dnsmasq issues CVE-2009-2957 and CVE-2009-2958;
gnutls issue CVE-2009-2730; krb5 issue CVE-2009-4212; bind issue
CVE-2010-0097; gzip issue CVE-2010-0001; openssl issues CVE-2009-2409 and
CVE-2009-4355; and gcc issue CVE-2009-3736.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* on systems with a large number of disk devices, USB storage devices may

get enumerated after "/dev/sdz", for example, "/dev/sdcd". This was not
handled by the udev rules, resulting in a missing "/dev/live" symbolic
link, causing installations from USB media to fail. With this update, udev
rules correctly handle USB storage devices on systems with a large number
of disk devices, which resolves this issue. (BZ#555083)

As RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from the KVM update
RHSA-2010:0088 have been included in this update:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0088.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

## NTP mode 7 denial-of-service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#568372

Original Release Date: 2009-12-08 | Last Revised: 2011-07-22

---

### Overview

NTP contains a vulnerability in the handling of mode 7 requests, which can result in a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| NTP mode 7 (MODE\_PRIVATE) is used by the ntpdc query and control utility. In contrast, ntpq uses NTP mode 6 (MODE\_CONTROL), while routine NTP time transfers use modes 1 through 5. Upon receipt of an incorrect mode 7 request or a mode 7 error response from an address that is not listed in a "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" segment, ntpd will reply with a mode 7 error response and log a message.  If an attacker spoofs the source address of ntpd host A in a mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host B, both A and B will continuously send each other error responses, for as long as those packets get through.If an attacker spoofs an address of ntpd host A in a mode 7 response packet sent to ntpd host A, then host A will respond to itself endlessly, consuming CPU and logging excessively. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause a denial-of-service condition on a vulnerable NTP server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in NTP 4.2.4p8. Please check with your vendor for an update, or you may download [NTP 4.2.4p8 from ntp.org](http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html). |
| --- |

| **Configure NTP to limit source addresses**By using "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" entries in the ntp.conf file, ntpd can be configured to limit the source addresses to which it will respond.**Filter NTP mode 7 packets that specify source and destination port 123**In most cases, ntpdc mode 7 requests will have either a source or destination port of 123, but not both.**Use anti-spoofing IP address filters**[RFC 2827 (BCP 38)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2827) describes network ingress filtering, which can prevent UDP traffic claiming to be from a local address from entering your network from an outside source. Some ISPs may employ unicast reverse path filtering ([uRPF](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3704)) to limit the spoofed traffic that can enter your network. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-27 10:47:01 UTC  ``` Robin Park and Dmitri Vinokurov of Alcatel-Lucent discovered a flaw in the way ntpd handles certain mode 7 packets.  A remote attacker able to send specially-crafted mode 7 NTP packet with a spoofed source IP address could cause ntpd running on one host, or two ntpds running on two hosts to send error packets in loop, resulting in excessive use of CPU and disk space (via logging).  Issue is tracked by US-CERT as VU#568372.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-27 10:52:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 366233](attachment.cgi?id=366233&action=diff "Upstream patch to be included in 4.2.4p8") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=366233&action=edit "Upstream patch to be included in 4.2.4p8") Upstream patch to be included in 4.2.4p8   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-02 20:07:12 UTC  ``` Impact and mitigations: - mode 7 NTP packets are processed by ntpd when they have source IP which is   allowed to query - when malformed mode 7 packet is received, ntpd sends back a reply packet   (using mode 7 again), this reply packet, when received by other ntpd,   triggers similar reply (resulting in reply loop among the two ntp hosts) - ntpd implements a check that prevents it from replying to packets with   source IP:port matching any of the local network interfaces on which ntpd   listens; this mitigates single host reply loops, but they may still be   possible to trigger using loopback addresses - excessive disk usage is mitigated by the way syslogd reports duplicate   messages (message is recorded once and repeat count is recorded when the   next different message is received); this mitigation may be minimized   during the multiple parallel attacks - single host reply loops using loopback addresses can be blocked by   dropping all packets with source addresses 127/8 not received via   loopback interface (via netfilter rule or rp_filter settings) - mode 7 packets are normally generated by ntpdc - ntpd query and   configuration command.  packets from ntpdc normally do not have source   port 123, so mode 7 NTP packets with source port 123 should be considered   suspicious. - netfilter module u32 can match mode 7 NTP packets using a check as:    --u32 "0>>22&0x3C@8>>24&0x7=7"   u32 module is, however, not included in kernel packages for current   Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions   note: this check needs to be combined with other check (udp packet, source /   destination port 123) - it's possible to mitigate this attack using recent netfilter module by   limiting maximum amount of NTP packets allowed to be received from single   IP address during the specified time period (break reply loops)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c8)  Vincent Danen    2009-12-08 18:45:20 UTC  ``` This is public now:  <https://lists.ntp.org/pipermail/announce/2009-December/000086.html>  and:  <https://support.ntp.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1331>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-08 19:33:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1648 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1648.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-08 19:50:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:1651 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1651.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c12)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-09 11:59:58 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p8-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ntp-4.2.4p8-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c13)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-09 12:03:46 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p7-3.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ntp-4.2.4p7-3.fc11>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c14)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-09 12:05:02 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p7-2.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ntp-4.2.4p7-2.fc10>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c15)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-11 18:14:23 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p8-1.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Updated copyright statement

A complete revision history is at the end of this file.

The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of programs that
launch denial-of-service attacks by creating a "UDP packet storm" either
on a system or between two systems. An attack on one host causes that host
to perform poorly. An attack between two hnosts can cause extreme network
congestion in addition to adversely affecting host performance.

The CERT staff recommends disabling unneeded UDP services on each host,
in particular the chargen and echo services, and filtering these services
at the firewall or Internet gateway.

Because the UDP port denial-of-service attacks typically involve IP
spoofing, we encourage you to follow the recommendations in advisory [CA-96.21](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-96.21.tcp_syn_flooding.html).

We will update this advisory as we receive additional information. Please
check advisory files regularly for updates that relate to your site

---

## I. Description

When a connection is established between two UDP services, each of which
produces output, these two services can produce a very high number of packets
that can lead to a denial of service on the machine(s) where the services
are offered. Anyone with network connectivity can launch an attack; no
account access is needed.

For example, by connecting a host's chargen service to the echo service
on the same or another machine, all affected machines may be effectively
taken out of service because of the excessively high number of packets
produced. In addition, if two or more hosts are so connected, the intervening
network may also become congested and deny service to all hosts whose traffic
traverses that network.
## II. Impact

Anyone with network connectivity can cause a denial of service. This attack
does not enable them to gain additional access.
## III. Solution

We recommend taking all the steps described below.
#### 1. Disable and filter chargen and echo services.

This attack is most readily exploited using the chargen or echo services,
neither of which is generally needed as far as we are aware. We recommend
that you disable both services on the host and filter them at the firewall
or Internet gateway.

To disable these services on a host, it is necessary to edit the inetd
configuration file and cause inetd to begin using the new configuration.
Exactly how to do this is system dependent so you should check your vendor's
documentation for *inetd(8)*; but on many UNIX systems the steps will
be as follows:

1. Edit the inetd configuration file (e.g. /etc/inetd.conf).
2. Comment out the echo, chargen, and other UDP services not used.
3. Cause the inetd process to reread the configuration file (e.g., by sending
   it a HUP signal).

#### 2. Disable and filter other unused UDP services.

To protect against similar attacks against other services, we recommend:

- disabling all unused UDP services on hosts and

- blocking at firewalls all UDP ports less than 900 with the exception
of specific services you require, such as DNS (port 53).
#### 3. If you must provide external access to some UDP services, consider using a proxy mechanism to protect that service from misuse.

Techniques to do this are discussed in Chapter 8, "Configuring Internet
Services," in \_Building Internet Firewalls\_ by Chapman and Zwicky (see
Section IV below).
#### 4. Monitor your network.

If you do provide external UDP services, we recommend monitoring your network
to learn which systems are using these services and to monitor for signs
of misuse. Tools for doing so include Argus, tcpdump, and netlog.

Argus is available from

ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/argus-1.5/

MD5 (argus-1.5.tar.gz) = 9c7052fb1742f9f6232a890267c03f3c

Note that Argus requires the TCP wrappers to install:

ftp://ftp.cert.org/pub/tools/tcp\_wrappers/tcp\_wrappers\_7.2.tar.Z

MD5 (tcp\_wrappers\_7.2.tar.Z) = 883d00cbd2dedd9bfc783b7065740e74

tcpdump is available from

ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpdump-3.0.2.tar.Z

MD5 (tcpdump-3.0.2.tar.Z) = c757608d5823aa68e4061ebd4753e591

Note that tcpdump requires libpcap, available at

ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap-0.0.6.tar.Z

MD5 (libpcap-0.0.6.tar.Z) = cda0980f786932a7e2eebfb2641aa7a0

netlog is available from

ftp://net.tamu.edu/pub/security/TAMU/netlog-1.2.tar.gz

MD5 (netlog-1.2.tar.gz) = 1dd62e7e96192456e8c75047c38e994b
#### 5. Take steps against IP spoofing.

Because IP spoofing is typically involved in UDP port denial-of-service
attacks, we encourage you to follow the guidance in advisory CA-95:01,
available from

[www.cert.org/advisories/CA-95.01.IP.spoofing.html](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-95.01.IP.spoofing.attacks.and.hijacked.terminal.connections.html)

# DNS Cookies: The Transaction Mechanism to Protect the Namespace

### Although they are not the cure for all name server problems, DNS cookies offer an extra layer of protection and are particularly effective against off-path attacks. Simone Catania, InterNetX, looks at how DNS cookies can make DNS transactions more secure.

##### Simone Catania

Global Content & Communications Manager
InterNetX

When the Domain Name System (DNS) was designed in the early 1980s, the Internet was only an academic project within a restricted pool of trusted users. Its rapid and exponential expansion over the past decades has made the Internet a global public utility network, subject to increasing abuse by malicious actors. Developing security mechanisms has become vital to the sustainable growth of the network of networks. Over the years, as the number of cyber attacks increased and new flaws in the DNS were found, the Internet community has developed new standardized security mechanisms: from best practices to minimize information exposure to protocols like [DNSSEC,](https://www.internetx.com/en/news-detailview/this-is-what-you-should-know-about-dnssec/) and encryption solutions to offer enhanced data and transaction security.

Included in the line of defense are DNS cookies, which can provide a certain degree of protection to DNS clients and servers, mostly against off-path attacks. No configuration is necessary and there is only one essential requirement: both parties in the transaction have to support DNS cookies. Learn about DNS cookies and how they offer special protection.

## The DNS is a vulnerable system

The DNS has seen many updates since its conceptualization by Paul Mockapetris in 1983 and its standardization by the IETF in 1986. Although the DNS design is far from being 100 percent safe, there are several security protocols in place to enhance DNS data and transactions. 2008 marked a turning point with the discovery by Daniel Kaminsky of a fundamental flaw that allowed DNS cache poisoning on most name servers. Working with major companies, computer scientists have been working to solve the issues, developing a patch to make the exploitation of the vulnerability more complex. However, the problem has still not been fully resolved.

### Available DNS security mechanisms

With the last paper published in 2005, DNSSEC is probably the main security extension. This protocol helps authenticate the data origin and provides authenticated denial of existence. This protocol is the best solution to prevent the manipulation or poisoning of responses to DNS requests, thereby protecting it against data and cache poisoning.

[Next Steps in Combatting DNS Abuse](/issues/security-1/combatting-dns-abuse)

Nonetheless, the cryptographic computational load it requires can worsen some denial-of-service attacks and the increased size of the DNS response packets. TSIG ([RFC2845](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2845)) and SIG(0) ([RFC 2931](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2931)) aim to protect transaction security. The first one uses keyed hash authentication codes, while the latter uses public-key authentication to digitally sign DNS requests and transactions/responses. Another aspect to consider is that DNS uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as the primary transport protocol. UDP does not offer an identity check and cannot provide any protection against spoofing attacks. Several measures reduce the cache poisoning rates between DNS clients and resolvers, such as source port randomization and 0x20 encoding, DNS-over-TCP, DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH). To secure communication between a resolver and an authoritative server, DNSCurve uses [elliptic curve cryptography](https://www.internetx.com/en/news-detailview/elliptic-curve-cryptography-your-future-proof-standard-for-encryption/). TLS/SSL and HTTPS encrypt the communication between client and server but only after the domain name resolution. They do not offer any protection in the DNS transmission to resolve the domain name.

These DNS protection mechanisms often operate on several levels for the [most common DNS attack methods](https://www.internetx.com/en/news-detailview/these-are-the-most-common-dns-attack-methods/), offering specific protection to a single element or passage of communication. However, none of them provide the protection provided by DNS cookies. This makes them a unique mechanism able to operate on their own and for their specific purposes.

## What are DNS cookies?

Now that we understand that DNS is not a secure system and that the current security systems do not offer complete protection, we can look at DNS cookies and learn how they operate.

So what is a DNS cookie? It is a lightweight DNS transaction security mechanism specified as an OPT record ([RFC 6891](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6891)) in DNS requests and responses. An OPT does not carry any DNS data since it only contains information about the question-and-answer sequence of a specific transaction. Their standardization paper [RFC 7873](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7873) of May 2016 states they are 64-bit pseudorandom values and, since they operate an OPT RR option, they require the specification Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS). DNS cookies are compatible with other DNS transaction security mechanisms and work with NAT and NAT-PT.

With regard to their lifetime, this may vary. Some DNS cookies last only a couple of minutes, while others live for days or weeks. At the same time, some DNS cookies might not change, even when the users connect to a VPN. It all depends on the DNS configurations.

## What does a DNS cookie do for cybersecurity?

Let's be clear: DNS cookies are not the panacea to all problems but they do close a gap. They can provide an additional security layer to authenticate DNS requests and responses and thus play an essential role in enhancing the security threshold of the DNS. They are particularly successful at mitigating off-path attacks.

## Client cookie vs. server cookie

When talking about DNS cookies, we need to clearly distinguish them based on who creates the cookie and consequently the client or server. On this basis, we can divide DNS cookies into two main categories:

* **Client cookies:** made up of the client IP address, the server IP address, and a secret of at least 64 bits known to the client only.
* **Server cookies:** consisting of theclient IP address, at least a 64-bit secret changed periodically and the client cookie.

Note that the client and the server cookies are private to both parties. The idea is that they are only required to recognize their own DNS cookie for more security.

### DNS cookies differ from regular cookies

Cookies have been used in HTTP connections for decades to store stateful information. Despite the similar name, DNS cookies are not related to browser cookies and require no JavaScript. This also means that clearing your browser's cookies and cache does not affect DNS cookies. While browser cookies can be "read" across different browsers and websites and divided into first-party and third-party cookies, this does not apply to DNS cookies. DNS cookies can also be read outside the web environment, e.g., to track conversion out of the website, such as in a mobile app.

## What does a DNS cookie do and why use it?

The DNS generates a high number of UDP transactions and hackers often target them since they can be easily spoofed. This is where DNS cookies come into play. They ensure that the querier and server, the parties involved in DNS information exchange, know they are communicating with the right and valid partner.

The DNS cookie helps the client verify that the server includes the client-provided cookie in DNS transactions. This procedure ensures that no off-path attacker has spoofed requests and responses. Without DNS cookies, the client and server need to somehow ensure that they are talking to the right end of the connection and not with a malicious actor.

Deploying them is very easy. They do not need any configuration and are also low-cost and lightweight. Having DNS cookies in the communication does not hold any particular disadvantages but decreases the general vulnerability to specific threats. There is only one crucial aspect to consider: DNS cookies must be supported by both the querier and server. If implemented by only one side, they are ignored!

![](https://www.dotmagazine.online/_Resources/Persistent/3/0/5/c/305c0958997b4542ec4c95816e665e515d22613b/DNS%20cookies%20transaction-1170x718.png)

## This is how DNS cookies are transmitted

DNS cookies follow a precise procedure within DNS communication. We will summarize this process in three steps.

1) The querier sends a query (OPT with a client cookie) to the server. The querier checks its cache and if it doesn't find any cookie for that particular server, it generates a new client cookie. The input contains the IP address, the server IP, and the secret self-generated by the client.

2) The server cannot do anything with the client cookie itself or get any security. So, it generates its server cookie for that specific client. Based on the pseudorandom function, the server will use the client IP, its random secret, and the client cookie as input. The server responds "normally," but it sends back the client and the server cookie on the OPT RR-Record section in the Extended DNS (EDNS) option. A safe query response contains an OPT with a client and server (DNS) cookie.

3) Now, the query goes back to the querier. It checks whether the received client cookie is valid. If it is not, the response does not come from the server it wanted to communicate with, so the querier can discard the response. In this case, a potential off-path attack has been prevented. Even if the attacker fakes the source IP of the server, the bogus response can be determined thanks to the client cookie.

![](https://www.dotmagazine.online/_Resources/Persistent/1/4/b/4/14b42262a7d37f9206eec3eef8fc5b907dab249a/DNS-communication-with-DNS-cookies-1170x1084.png)

## What threats can DNS cookies protect against?

DNS cookies are particularly efficient against off-path attacks, which open off-path to intercept the DNS transaction and inject malicious content. The attacker is thus able to "read" the private transaction and edit the message before passing it to the intended recipient.

These are the three groups of attacks DNS cookies can protect from.

**1. Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on DNS servers**

In the framework of a denial-of-service attack, DNS cookies can protect the server against forged requests and before any recursive queries or public key cryptographic operations.

Although DNS cookies do not provide direct protection against on-path attacks, which use correct source addresses that saturate a server with DNS requests, knowing the source IP addresses helps counteract such attacks, e.g. by contacting the attack origin networks and stopping them.

**2. DNS amplification attacks**

Forging DNS requests with a different source IP address will redirect the traffic and interfere with the service. Furthermore, the responses can be made longer to amplify the attack. In this case, DNS cookies can help limit the amplification of the attack.

**3. DNS cache poisoning and answer forgery attacks**

DNS cookies can reject forged replies when sending forged responses to a resolver. This prevents all those attacks that poison the name server's cache.

## The DNS cookies adoption remains low

Since 2016, the deployment of DNS cookies has spread and many open-source DNS software vendors now support them. But an [academic study](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-72582-2_18) published in 2021 aimed at analyzing DNS cookie use found that 30 percent of servers fully support cookies. Still, only 10 percent of recursive clients send cookies. This research indicates a relatively low level of adoption and minimal enforcement of DNS cookies today. Their relatively minimal impact is therefore attributed to the low adoption rate.

## DNS cookies require more deployment

Although DNS cookies represent a weak authentication form for DNS requests and responses, they provide an additional layer of protection that, combined with other DNS security protocols such as DNSSEC, TSIG, and SIG(0), can significantly reduce cyber attacks on the global Internet.

To achieve a higher level of security, greater adoption and strategies for enforcement are required. The Internet community should look at enforcement strategies among clients and servers and encourage using cookies. Due to the diversified Internet ecosystem, universal adoption is extremely unlikely, but greater adoption in itself would result in more beneficial results for [DNS and domains protection](https://www.internetx.com/en/domain-security/).

A complete revision history is at the end of this file.

The CERT Coordination Center has received reports of programs that
launch denial-of-service attacks by creating a "UDP packet storm" either
on a system or between two systems. An attack on one host causes that host
to perform poorly. An attack between two hnosts can cause extreme network
congestion in addition to adversely affecting host performance.

The CERT staff recommends disabling unneeded UDP services on each host,
in particular the chargen and echo services, and filtering these services
at the firewall or Internet gateway.

Because the UDP port denial-of-service attacks typically involve IP
spoofing, we encourage you to follow the recommendations in advisory [CA-96.21](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-96.21.tcp_syn_flooding.html).

We will update this advisory as we receive additional information. Please
check advisory files regularly for updates that relate to your site

## I. Description

When a connection is established between two UDP services, each of which
produces output, these two services can produce a very high number of packets
that can lead to a denial of service on the machine(s) where the services
are offered. Anyone with network connectivity can launch an attack; no
account access is needed.

For example, by connecting a host's chargen service to the echo service
on the same or another machine, all affected machines may be effectively
taken out of service because of the excessively high number of packets
produced. In addition, if two or more hosts are so connected, the intervening
network may also become congested and deny service to all hosts whose traffic
traverses that network.
## II. Impact

Anyone with network connectivity can cause a denial of service. This attack
does not enable them to gain additional access.
## III. Solution

We recommend taking all the steps described below.
#### 1. Disable and filter chargen and echo services.

This attack is most readily exploited using the chargen or echo services,
neither of which is generally needed as far as we are aware. We recommend
that you disable both services on the host and filter them at the firewall
or Internet gateway.

To disable these services on a host, it is necessary to edit the inetd
configuration file and cause inetd to begin using the new configuration.
Exactly how to do this is system dependent so you should check your vendor's
documentation for *inetd(8)*; but on many UNIX systems the steps will
be as follows:

1. Edit the inetd configuration file (e.g. /etc/inetd.conf).
2. Comment out the echo, chargen, and other UDP services not used.
3. Cause the inetd process to reread the configuration file (e.g., by sending
   it a HUP signal).

#### 2. Disable and filter other unused UDP services.

To protect against similar attacks against other services, we recommend:

- disabling all unused UDP services on hosts and

- blocking at firewalls all UDP ports less than 900 with the exception
of specific services you require, such as DNS (port 53).
#### 3. If you must provide external access to some UDP services, consider using a proxy mechanism to protect that service from misuse.

Techniques to do this are discussed in Chapter 8, "Configuring Internet
Services," in \_Building Internet Firewalls\_ by Chapman and Zwicky (see
Section IV below).
#### 4. Monitor your network.

If you do provide external UDP services, we recommend monitoring your network
to learn which systems are using these services and to monitor for signs
of misuse. Tools for doing so include Argus, tcpdump, and netlog.

Argus is available from

ftp://ftp.net.cmu.edu/pub/argus-1.5/

MD5 (argus-1.5.tar.gz) = 9c7052fb1742f9f6232a890267c03f3c

Note that Argus requires the TCP wrappers to install:

ftp://ftp.cert.org/pub/tools/tcp\_wrappers/tcp\_wrappers\_7.2.tar.Z

MD5 (tcp\_wrappers\_7.2.tar.Z) = 883d00cbd2dedd9bfc783b7065740e74

tcpdump is available from

ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/tcpdump-3.0.2.tar.Z

MD5 (tcpdump-3.0.2.tar.Z) = c757608d5823aa68e4061ebd4753e591

Note that tcpdump requires libpcap, available at

ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap-0.0.6.tar.Z

MD5 (libpcap-0.0.6.tar.Z) = cda0980f786932a7e2eebfb2641aa7a0

netlog is available from

ftp://net.tamu.edu/pub/security/TAMU/netlog-1.2.tar.gz

MD5 (netlog-1.2.tar.gz) = 1dd62e7e96192456e8c75047c38e994b
#### 5. Take steps against IP spoofing.

Because IP spoofing is typically involved in UDP port denial-of-service
attacks, we encourage you to follow the guidance in advisory CA-95:01,
available from

[www.cert.org/advisories/CA-95.01.IP.spoofing.html](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-95.01.IP.spoofing.attacks.and.hijacked.terminal.connections.html)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Implementations of UDP-based application protocols are vulnerable to network loops

#### Vulnerability Note VU#417980

Original Release Date: 2024-03-19 | Last Revised: 2024-10-03

---

### Overview

A novel traffic-loop vulnerability has been identified against certain implementations of UDP-based applications protocols. An unauthenticated attacker can use maliciously-crafted packets against a UDP-based vulnerable implementation of application protocols (e.g., DNS, NTP, TFTP) that can lead to Denial-of-Service (DOS) and/or abuse of resources.

### Description

The User Datagram Protocol ([UDP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc768)) is a simple, connectionless protocol that is still commonly used in many internet-based applications. UDP has a limited packet-verification capability and is susceptible to IP spoofing. Security researchers have identified that certain implementations of the UDP protocol in applications can be triggered to create a network-loop of seemingly never-ending packets. Software implementations of UDP-based application protocols DNS, NTP, TFTP, Echo (RFC862), Chargen (RFC864), and QOTD (RFC865) were specifically found to be vulnerable to such network loops.

As an example, if two application servers have a vulnerable implementation of said protocol, an attacker can initiate a communication with the first server, spoofing the network address of the second server (victim). In many cases, the first server will respond with an error message to the victim, which will also trigger a similar behavior of another error message back to the first server. This behavior has been demonstrated to be resource exhausting and can cause services to become either unresponsive or unstable.

### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in the following scenarios:
1. Overload of a vulnerable service, causing it to become unstable or unusable.
2. DOS attack of the network backbone, causing network outage to other services.
3. Amplification attacks that involve network loops causing amplified DOS or DDOS attacks.

### Solution

#### Apply updates

CERT/CC recommends that you apply the latest patch provided by the affected vendor that addresses this vulnerability in the vendor-specific implementations. Review the vendor-specific information below. If the product is end-of-life/unsupported, vendors will be unlikely to release a patch; thus, we recommend replacing the device.

#### Protect or replace UDP applications

When possible, protect UDP-based applications using network firewall rules and/or other access-control lists to prevent unauthorized access. If the same service can be implemented using a TCP or with any request-validation capability (e.g., [Message-Authenticator](https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2869.html#Message-Authenticator)) available in the UDP-based application protocol, implement such protection to prevent unknown or spoofed requests. It is recommended that you disable unnecessary and unused UDP services that may be enabled as part of your operating system to prevent exposure of these services for abuse.

#### Deploy anti-spoofing

Network providers should deploy available anti-spoofing techniques ([BCP38](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp38)) such as Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding ([uRPF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3704)) to prevent IP spoofing in protecting their internet-facing resources against spoofing and abuse.

#### Enforce network rate-limiting

Service providers should employ network rate-limiting capabilities, such Quality-of-Service (QoS) to protect their network from abuse from network loops and amplifications and to ensure their critical resources/services are protected.

ntp\_request.c in ntpd in NTP before 4.2.4p8, and 4.2.5, allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and bandwidth consumption) by
using MODE\_PRIVATE to send a spoofed (1) request or (2) response packet
that triggers a continuous exchange of MODE\_PRIVATE error responses between
two NTP daemons.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-27 10:47:01 UTC  ``` Robin Park and Dmitri Vinokurov of Alcatel-Lucent discovered a flaw in the way ntpd handles certain mode 7 packets.  A remote attacker able to send specially-crafted mode 7 NTP packet with a spoofed source IP address could cause ntpd running on one host, or two ntpds running on two hosts to send error packets in loop, resulting in excessive use of CPU and disk space (via logging).  Issue is tracked by US-CERT as VU#568372.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-27 10:52:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 366233](attachment.cgi?id=366233&action=diff "Upstream patch to be included in 4.2.4p8") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=366233&action=edit "Upstream patch to be included in 4.2.4p8") Upstream patch to be included in 4.2.4p8   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-02 20:07:12 UTC  ``` Impact and mitigations: - mode 7 NTP packets are processed by ntpd when they have source IP which is   allowed to query - when malformed mode 7 packet is received, ntpd sends back a reply packet   (using mode 7 again), this reply packet, when received by other ntpd,   triggers similar reply (resulting in reply loop among the two ntp hosts) - ntpd implements a check that prevents it from replying to packets with   source IP:port matching any of the local network interfaces on which ntpd   listens; this mitigates single host reply loops, but they may still be   possible to trigger using loopback addresses - excessive disk usage is mitigated by the way syslogd reports duplicate   messages (message is recorded once and repeat count is recorded when the   next different message is received); this mitigation may be minimized   during the multiple parallel attacks - single host reply loops using loopback addresses can be blocked by   dropping all packets with source addresses 127/8 not received via   loopback interface (via netfilter rule or rp_filter settings) - mode 7 packets are normally generated by ntpdc - ntpd query and   configuration command.  packets from ntpdc normally do not have source   port 123, so mode 7 NTP packets with source port 123 should be considered   suspicious. - netfilter module u32 can match mode 7 NTP packets using a check as:    --u32 "0>>22&0x3C@8>>24&0x7=7"   u32 module is, however, not included in kernel packages for current   Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions   note: this check needs to be combined with other check (udp packet, source /   destination port 123) - it's possible to mitigate this attack using recent netfilter module by   limiting maximum amount of NTP packets allowed to be received from single   IP address during the specified time period (break reply loops)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c8)  Vincent Danen    2009-12-08 18:45:20 UTC  ``` This is public now:  <https://lists.ntp.org/pipermail/announce/2009-December/000086.html>  and:  <https://support.ntp.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=1331>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-08 19:33:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1648 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1648.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-08 19:50:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:1651 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1651.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c12)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-09 11:59:58 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p8-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ntp-4.2.4p8-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c13)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-09 12:03:46 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p7-3.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ntp-4.2.4p7-3.fc11>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c14)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-09 12:05:02 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p7-2.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ntp-4.2.4p7-2.fc10>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=531213#c15)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-11 18:14:23 UTC  ``` ntp-4.2.4p8-1.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.

RHSA-2009:1651 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2009-12-08
Updated:
2009-12-08
# RHSA-2009:1651 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: ntp security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An updated ntp package that fixes two security issues is now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's time
with a referenced time source.

Robin Park and Dmitri Vinokurov discovered a flaw in the way ntpd handled
certain malformed NTP packets. ntpd logged information about all such
packets and replied with an NTP packet that was treated as malformed when
received by another ntpd. A remote attacker could use this flaw to create
an NTP packet reply loop between two ntpd servers via a malformed packet
with a spoofed source IP address and port, causing ntpd on those servers to
use excessive amounts of CPU time and fill disk space with log messages.
(CVE-2009-3563)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A
malicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an ntpq
request that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with

Package        : ntp
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 560074
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-3563

Robin Park and Dmitri Vinokurov discovered that the daemon component of
the ntp package, a reference implementation of the NTP protocol, is
not properly reacting to certain incoming packets.

An unexpected NTP mode 7 packets (MODE_PRIVATE) with spoofed IP data can lead
ntpd to reply with a mode 7 response to the spoofed address.  This may result
in the service playing packet ping-pong with other ntp servers or even itself
which causes CPU usage and excessive disk use due to logging.  An attacker
can use this to conduct denial of service attacks.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.2.2.p4+dfsg-2etch4.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.2.4p4+dfsg-8lenny3.

For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem
will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
