Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2009-3563:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of mode 7 (MODE\_PRIVATE) packets by the `ntpd` daemon in NTP implementations prior to version 4.2.4p8 and also in version 4.2.5.
*   Specifically, the issue arises when `ntpd` receives a malformed mode 7 request or a mode 7 error response from an address not restricted by "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" directives.
*   In such cases, `ntpd` responds with its own mode 7 error response, potentially creating a loop.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation for mode 7 packets, particularly error responses, leading to a response loop.
*   **Lack of Response Handling Logic:** `ntpd` responds to mode 7 error responses instead of dropping them.
*   **Vulnerability to Spoofing:** The vulnerability can be exploited using spoofed source IP addresses.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most prominent impact is a DoS attack due to the infinite loop of mode 7 error responses between `ntpd` instances, which can consume excessive CPU and network bandwidth on the affected servers.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The loop can lead to increased CPU utilization and log file sizes, potentially filling up disk space.
*   **Potential Single Host DoS:** By spoofing the source address to match its own, a single `ntpd` instance can be made to send packets to itself, causing it to become unresponsive.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely by an unauthenticated attacker who can send crafted UDP packets.
*   **Spoofed Source IP:** The attacker spoofs the source IP address in mode 7 packets, targeting one or more `ntpd` servers.
*   **Specific UDP Packet:** The attacker sends a specifically crafted UDP packet with a payload of `0x17` (NTP Request in mode 7) or `97 00 00 00` (Response mode 7), or a malformed mode 7 packet.
*   **Port 123:** The exploit typically uses source and destination port 123.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send UDP packets to the target `ntpd` server(s).
*   **IP Spoofing:** The attacker must be capable of spoofing IP addresses.
*   **Basic Understanding of NTP:** The attacker needs knowledge of the structure of NTP packets and the purpose of mode 7.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially discovered by Robin Park and Dmitri Vinokurov of Alcatel-Lucent.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2009-3563 and tracked by US-CERT as VU#568372.
*   A fix was implemented in NTP version 4.2.4p8.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated using "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" configurations in `ntp.conf` and implementing ingress and egress filtering using BCP38.
*  The bug report from the NTP project clarifies that the core issue was ntpd responding to mode 7 *responses* and that the fix involves dropping mode 7 responses and avoiding response to other malformed packets. Also that the fix was included in 4.2.4p8 and 4.2.6.
*  Red Hat's bug report also mentions that the `ntpq` and `ntpdc` commands would normally use different source ports, not both source and destination port 123.

**Mitigation strategies mentioned:**

*   Apply the vendor-provided patch.
*   Restrict source addresses using "restrict ... noquery" or "restrict ... ignore" entries in the `ntp.conf` file.
*   Filter NTP mode 7 packets with both source and destination ports 123.
*   Use anti-spoofing IP address filters using BCP38.

**Affected Products**

Multiple vendors and products were reported as affected, including:

*   Apple Inc.
*   Cisco Systems, Inc.
*   Debian GNU/Linux
*   Gentoo Linux
*   Meinberg Funkuhren GmbH & Co. KG
*   QNX Software Systems Inc.
*   Red Hat, Inc.
*   Sun Microsystems, Inc.
*   The SCO Group
*   Ubuntu

**Unaffected Products**

*   Computer Associates
*   Extreme Networks
*    Force10 Networks, Inc.

In summary, this vulnerability allows for a relatively simple yet effective DoS attack against NTP servers due to their improper handling of mode 7 error responses. It highlights the importance of input validation, proper protocol handling, and network security measures like ingress/egress filtering and rate-limiting.
