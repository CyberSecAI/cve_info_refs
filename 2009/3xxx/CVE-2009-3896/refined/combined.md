# nginx: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-22**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in nginx, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/nginx** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.14** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.14** |

### Background

nginx is a robust, small, and high performance HTTP and reverse proxy
server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in nginx:

* The TLS protocol does not properly handle session renegotiation
  requests (CVE-2009-3555).
* The "ngx\_http\_process\_request\_headers()" function in ngx\_http\_parse.c
  could cause a NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2009-3896).
* nginx does not properly sanitize user input for the the WebDAV COPY
  or MOVE methods (CVE-2009-3898).
* The "ngx\_resolver\_copy()" function in ngx\_resolver.c contains a
  boundary error which could cause a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2011-4315).
* nginx does not properly parse HTTP header responses which could
  expose sensitive information (CVE-2012-1180).

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the nginx process, cause a Denial of Service condition,
create or overwrite arbitrary files, or obtain sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All nginx users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/nginx-1.0.14"

```

Subject: CVEs for nginx

Hi,

are the CVEs for

1.) nginx webdav: <http://secunia.com/advisories/36818/>

2.) nginx Null Pointer dereference:
<http://sysoev.ru/nginx/patch.null.pointer.txt>

3.) nginx SSL Renegotiation: <http://sysoev.ru/nginx/patch.cve-2009-3555.txt>

I know the last one contains a CVE number, nginx uses openssl and the
patch will disable renegotiation, maybe this deserves an own CVE?

Best regards,

Craig

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1920-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Stefan Fritsch
October 26, 2009                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : no CVE Id yet
Debian Bug     : 552035

A denial of service vulnerability has been found in nginx, a small and
efficient web server.

Jasson Bell discovered that a remote attacker could cause a denial of service
(segmentation fault) by sending a crafted request.

For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.4.13-2+etch3

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version
0.6.32-3+lenny3

For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem has
been fixed in version 0.7.62-1

We recommend that you upgrade your nginx package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch

Oldstable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips,
mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Yes. However, it's not a buffer overflow as stated there.
The published exploit causes always a null pointer dereference only
and you can not execute arbitrary code as stated there.

Let's use CVE-2009-3898 for this one:

CVE-2009-3898

nginx versions before 0.8.17 and 0.7.63 contain a directory traversal flaw in
the webdav component. A user who can COPY or MOVE permissions could place
files outside the webdav root.

We'll use the same ID. mod_ssl did a similar thing and used CVE-2009-3555. I
think multiple IDs in this instance would actually create more confusion that
it would solve.

Thanks.
