Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-3068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user input within a Java Servlet that handles POST requests on the Adobe RoboHelp Server's management web server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The server fails to properly sanitize user input in POST requests, specifically within a Java Servlet. This allows for the injection of malicious data.
- **Missing Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication, allowing remote attackers direct access.
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The vulnerability enables an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Once a malicious file is uploaded, the vulnerability allows for the execution of that file on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete system compromise.
- **SYSTEM Level Privileges:** The attacker can achieve complete system compromise under SYSTEM credentials, which means full control over the affected server.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Remote attacker can execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
- **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability through the management web server listening on port 8080 (default).
- **HTTP POST Requests:** The attack is carried out by sending specially crafted POST requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Adobe RoboHelp Server.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to create and send specially crafted POST requests designed to exploit the lack of input validation.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by filter ID `8527`.
- Adobe has released a security update (APSB09-14) to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Stephen Fewer of Harmony Security.
- Exploitation results in complete system compromise under SYSTEM credentials.
