Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3971

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `season` parameter when constructing SQL queries within the Joomla! Component `com_jtips`. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning that the attacker can't directly see the output of their SQL queries but can infer results based on the application's behavior (e.g., a page displaying differently based on true/false conditions).
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The component does not validate or sanitize the 'season' parameter, allowing arbitrary SQL code to be inserted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker could potentially access and extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker might modify, insert, or delete data within the database.
*   **Application Compromise:** In severe cases, this vulnerability can lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is exploitable via the `season` parameter in the URL when the `ladder` task is used in the `com_jtips` component.
*   **Direct Web Request:** Attackers can directly craft malicious requests targeting the vulnerable parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** A basic understanding of how HTTP requests and parameters function is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to know the basics of SQL injection in order to construct the appropriate payloads.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit was tested on Joomla! Component `com_jtips` versions 1.0.7 and 1.0.9.
*   The provided exploit examples demonstrate the blind nature of the SQL injection by using `and 1=1` and `and 1=2` to induce true and false conditions.
