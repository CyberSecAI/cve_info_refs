Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3167:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `template` parameter of the `index.php` file in Gazelle CMS 1.0.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files by manipulating the `template` parameter. The path traversal is achieved using `..` sequences and a null byte (`%00`) to bypass any potential filtering.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, leading to potential disclosure of system information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` file, including the malicious `template` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Gazelle CMS instance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit can be executed without any prior authentication, making it easily exploitable by anyone with network access to the vulnerable application.
*  **magic_quote_gpc Off (Optional):** The exploit also mentions that `magic_quote_gpc` should be off for the Local File Inclusion (LFI) to work, suggesting a possible configuration dependency, however, the LFI will still occur without this being disabled.

**Additional details (from the second exploit):**

*   CVE-2009-3167 is also listed among a group of other CVEs affecting the same application.
*   The vulnerability is also mentioned as part of a larger exploit that also includes Remote Code Execution (RCE) via another vulnerability within the CMS, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and password reset vulnerability.
*   The LFI vulnerability is attributed to "fuzion" and is specifically located at `http://localhost/gazelle/index.php?template=[LFI]`.
