    "Relevant": true,
    "Information": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an SQL injection flaw in the 'show' parameter of the 'index.php' script.",
      "Weaknesses": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the 'show' parameter, allowing the execution of arbitrary SQL queries.",
      "Impact": "An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, modify or delete data, or even gain control of the server depending on database privileges. The provided examples show how to retrieve the database version, username, and the content of the config.php file.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the vulnerable 'index.php' file by manipulating the 'show' parameter. Specifically, the exploit uses a 'union select' statement to inject malicious SQL code.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges or authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
