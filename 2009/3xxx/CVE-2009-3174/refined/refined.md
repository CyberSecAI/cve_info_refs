  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a `require` statement with a user-controlled parameter, allowing for remote file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `chemin_lib` parameter in the URL, pointing it to a remote file.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server with a modified `chemin_lib` parameter."
