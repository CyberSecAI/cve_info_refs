  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Acrobat allow for arbitrary code execution, file/folder writing, privilege escalation, or denial of service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Code execution",
      "Arbitrary file/folder writing",
      "Privilege escalation",
      "Denial of service"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, write arbitrary files or folders, escalate local privileges, or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. This occurs when a user opens a specially crafted PDF file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Convincing a user to open a malicious PDF file",
      "Websites hosting malicious PDF documents",
       "Email attachments"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file and trick a user into opening it. This could be done through a website or an email.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerabilities exist in Adobe Reader and Acrobat versions 9.1.3 and earlier 9.x, 8.1.6 and earlier 8.x, and 7.1.3 and earlier 7.x. The Adobe Reader browser plug-in can automatically open PDF documents hosted on websites, which increases the attack surface."
