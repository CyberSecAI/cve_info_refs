The provided content describes multiple XSS vulnerabilities related to how various web browsers handle redirects, specifically focusing on `javascript:` and `data:` URIs within `Location` and `Refresh` headers. This aligns with the nature of CVE-2009-3013 which is about XSS via redirects.

Here's a breakdown of the described vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in the browsers' failure to properly sanitize or validate the target URLs in redirect headers (`Location` and `Refresh`).  Browsers incorrectly interpret `javascript:` and `data:` URIs within these headers as executable code instead of just URLs, leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of `javascript:` URIs in Redirects:**  Browsers execute JavaScript code embedded in `javascript:` URIs found within `Location` or `Refresh` headers.
*   **Improper Handling of `data:` URIs in Redirects:** Browsers render HTML or execute scripts embedded in `data:` URIs found within `Location` or `Refresh` headers.
*   **Varying Context Execution:** Some browsers execute the code in the context of the redirected site (allowing access to cookies), while others execute it in a different context, limiting impact to Javascript execution and phishing.
*   **Specific HTTP Status Codes:** Some vulnerabilities only trigger with specific HTTP response codes (e.g., 302 Object Moved).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable website.
*   **Cookie Stealing:** If JavaScript executes in the context of the website, attackers can steal cookies.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can display fake content or redirects by controlling Javascript execution.
*   **Malware Distribution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, attackers can use these vulnerabilities to spread malware.
*   **Bypassing Security Filters:** Usage of `data:` URI allows bypassing of anti-phishing and anti-malware filters that operate by URL filtering.
*   **Social Engineering:** Some vulnerabilities rely on user interaction (clicking a link on "Object Moved" or "Unable to connect" page) making them social XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Redirect Parameters:** An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious `javascript:` or `data:` URI as a parameter.
*   **Server-Side Redirectors:** A vulnerable server-side script accepts the attacker's malicious URI as a parameter and uses it in a `Location` or `Refresh` header.
*   **Redirection Services:** Vulnerable redirectors can be used to redirect users to malicious code using crafted URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to create URLs containing `javascript:` or `data:` URIs to inject into redirect flows.
*   **Target Website with a Vulnerable Redirector:** The attacker needs access to a website that uses redirectors (either `Location` or `Refresh` headers) that pass user-supplied data to the redirect URL.
*   **User Interaction (for some):** Some attacks require a victim to click a link on a message page such as "Object Moved" or "Unable to Connect"

**Specific Browser Vulnerabilities Mentioned:**

The content details that the vulnerability exists in various versions of:

*   **Mozilla (older versions):** Vulnerable to many types of XSS via redirects, including javascript and data URIs.
*   **Firefox (multiple versions):** Vulnerable to various attacks depending on the version.
*   **Internet Explorer 6 (and prior):** Vulnerable to XSS through refresh-header redirectors.
*   **Opera (multiple versions):** Vulnerable to attacks via refresh and location-header redirectors.
*   **Google Chrome (multiple versions):** Vulnerable to attacks via refresh-header redirectors.
*   **Maxthon 3 Alpha:** Vulnerable to XSS through location-header redirectors with both 301 and 302 status codes and when using Ultramode.
*  **QtWeb:** Vulnerable to attacks via refresh and location-header redirectors
*  **Safari 4.0.3:** Vulnerable to attacks via refresh-header redirectors.
*   **SeaMonkey 1.1.17:** Vulnerable to attacks via refresh and location-header redirectors.
* **Orca Browser 1.2 build 5:** Vulnerable to attacks via refresh and location-header redirectors.

**Summary of attacks:**

* **Attack #1:** XSS via `javascript:` URI in `refresh-header` (Mozilla 1.7.x, Firefox <= 3.0.8, IE6, Opera <= 9.52, Chrome <= 1.0.154.48)
* **Attack #2:** XSS via `data:` URI in `refresh-header` (Mozilla 1.7.x, Firefox <= 3.0.12, Chrome <= 1.0.154.48)
* **Attack #3:** XSS via `data:` URI in `location-header` (Firefox <= 3.0.12, Opera <= 9.52)
* **Attack #4:** XSS via `javascript:` URI in `location-header` with 302 (Mozilla 1.7.x, Firefox <= 3.0.12). Social XSS.
* **Attack #5:** XSS via `javascript:` URI in `location-header` with 301/302 (Maxthon 3 Alpha with Ultramode). Social XSS.
* **Attack #6:** XSS via `javascript:` URI in `location-header` with 302 Found (Mozilla 1.7.x, Firefox <= 3.0.19). Social XSS.
* **Attacks #7,8:** Additional attacks via 301 and 303 redirect codes.
