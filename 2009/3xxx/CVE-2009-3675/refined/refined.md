Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-3675:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability exists because the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) in Microsoft Windows does not properly handle specially crafted Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) messages with malformed packets. These messages are communicated through IPsec.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper handling of malformed ISAKMP messages by LSASS.
- Lack of proper validation or parsing of ISAKMP packets within LSASS.
- Vulnerability in the IPsec communication processing within the Windows OS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to excessive consumption of CPU resources by the LSASS process, causing the affected system to become unresponsive until it is restarted. The system will be unable to provide security services while in this state.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack is carried out remotely.
- **Authenticated:** The attacker must be authenticated and communicating through IPsec.
- **Specially crafted ISAKMP messages:** The attack involves sending specially crafted ISAKMP messages containing malformed packets to a vulnerable system's LSASS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be on the network and be able to communicate with the target system over IPsec.
-   The attacker needs valid credentials to authenticate with the targeted machine.
-   The attacker must have the ability to craft malicious ISAKMP packets.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition SP2, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition SP2, and Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems.
- It does not affect Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, or later versions.
- Microsoft has released a security update (MS09-069) to address this vulnerability, which involves changing how LSASS handles malformed ISAKMP requests.
- A temporary workaround was to disable the IPsec service, but this would prevent the use of IPsec on the affected computer.
- Microsoft was not aware of active exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the security bulletin release.
- The Microsoft Exploitability Index for this vulnerability was rated as "Important".
