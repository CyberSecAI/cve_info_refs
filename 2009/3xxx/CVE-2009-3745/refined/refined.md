Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3745

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the query string of the Application Security Enterprise (ASE) help pages. Specifically, the `tabstripid` parameter in the URL `http://host/ase/Help/Help.aspx` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `tabstripid` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that can be executed within the context of the user's browser when they visit the vulnerable page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the application.
    - Deface the web page, injecting malicious content.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's browser and session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the `tabstripid` parameter.
- An attacker can trick a user into clicking this crafted link via social engineering, or by injecting it into a page the user will likely visit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable `tabstripid` parameter.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated and the user's access to the application and their browsing the crafted URL is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Rational AppScan Enterprise 5.6.
- The APAR number associated with this vulnerability is PK97516.
