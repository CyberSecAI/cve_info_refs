Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-3553:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper file descriptor handling leading to a use-after-free condition. Specifically, it's a flaw in how CUPS manages references to file descriptors in its abstract file descriptor handling interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause the `cupsd` daemon to crash. This is primarily due to the use-after-free condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted request to the CUPS server.
- **Specific CUPS request:** The attack is triggered by a maliciously crafted `get-printer-jobs` request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the targeted CUPS server.
- No authentication is mentioned, suggesting this vulnerability is exploitable without prior access.
- The attacker needs to know the address of the CUPS server.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The vulnerability was triggered when querying for the list of current print jobs for a specific printer in a specially crafted manner.
-  A reproducer is mentioned which involves producing 300 active jobs on the CUPS server and then executing a specific Java client to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Ubuntu, Debian and Mac OS X. Patches were made available for these operating systems.
- The vulnerability is present in CUPS versions prior to 1.4.8-r1 (Gentoo).
- Apple mitigates the issue by automatically restarting the `cupsd` daemon after termination.

In summary, CVE-2009-3553 describes a use-after-free vulnerability in CUPS that allows a remote attacker to crash the print server by sending a specially crafted print job query.
