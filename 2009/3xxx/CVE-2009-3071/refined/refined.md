          "details": "A crash occurs in nsPropertyTable::PropertyList::Equals during layout operations, potentially due to incorrect handling of properties in the layout engine. This could be triggered by specific HTML/CSS content. The vulnerability may lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited.",

This is due to an improper check for safe script execution.",
