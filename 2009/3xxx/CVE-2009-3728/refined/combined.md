# Sun JDK/JRE: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200911-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Sun JDK and JRE allow for several attacks,
including the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/sun-jre-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.0.17** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.5.0.22**>= **1.6.0.17** |

| Package | **dev-java/sun-jdk** on all architectures |

| Package | **dev-java/blackdown-jdk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.4.2.03-r16** |

| Package | **app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.0.17** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.5.0.22**>= **1.6.0.17** |

### Background

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the Sun Java
implementation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below and
the associated Sun Alerts for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted JAR
archive, applet, or Java Web Start application, possibly resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. Furthermore, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of
Service affecting multiple services via several vectors, disclose
information and memory contents, write or execute local files, conduct
session hijacking attacks via GIFAR files, steal cookies, bypass the
same-origin policy, load untrusted JAR files, establish network
connections to arbitrary hosts and posts via several vectors, modify
the list of supported graphics configurations, bypass HMAC-based
authentication systems, escalate privileges via several vectors and
cause applet code to be executed with older, possibly vulnerable
versions of the JRE.

NOTE: Some vulnerabilities require a trusted environment, user
interaction, a DNS Man-in-the-Middle or Cross-Site-Scripting attack.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Sun JRE 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JRE 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JDK 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JDK 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.6.0.17"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.5.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.5.0.22"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.6.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JRE 1.4.x, Sun JDK 1.4.x, Blackdown JRE, Blackdown JDK and
precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.4.x users are strongly advised to unmerge
Java 1.4:

```
 # emerge --unmerge =app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jdk-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jdk
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jre
```

Gentoo is ceasing support for the 1.4 generation of the Sun Java
Platform in accordance with upstream. All 1.4 JRE and JDK versions are
masked and will be removed shortly.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=530098#c3)  Mark J. Cox    2009-11-03 23:06:34 UTC  ``` Available information:  "ICC_Profile allows detecting if some files exist"   Interpretation after code inspection.     An information leakage vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment   with color profiles may allow application to determine the existence    of color profile files outside of the ${java.iccprofile.path} directory.    This is possible by checking whether the returned   value of ICC_Profile.getInstance with a returns a null for a given file name   that has a directory traversal prefix (like ../blabla.pf).  Evaluation:    This is a borderline case of information leakage, as the java.io.File class   allows to aquire the same information easier, and is not limited to color     profiles. But as a positive side effect the patch shortens the length of a    the privileged block to read the color profile, and reduces the generic    attack surface.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=530098#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-09 15:04:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Extras for RHEL 4   Extras for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1560 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1560.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=530098#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-10 19:30:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Extras for RHEL 4   Extras for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1571 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1571.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=530098#c7)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-13 08:45:48 UTC  ``` java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0-33.b16.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0-33.b16.fc12>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=530098#c8)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-13 08:49:43 UTC  ``` java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0-23.b16.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0-23.b16.fc10>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=530098#c9)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-13 16:34:54 UTC  ``` java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0-30.b16.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0-30.b16.fc11>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=530098#c10)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-14 03:29:50 UTC  ``` java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0-30.b16.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
