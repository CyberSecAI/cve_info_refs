Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-3728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Java's `ICC_Profile` class handles file paths when loading color profiles. Specifically, it does not properly validate or restrict file paths, leading to an information leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Leakage:** An untrusted Java applet can potentially determine the existence of files outside the designated `${java.iccprofile.path}` directory.
- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability exploits directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../blabla.pf`) in the file path passed to `ICC_Profile.getInstance()`.
- **Insecure File Handling:** The `ICC_Profile.getInstance()` method may return `null` if a file does not exist, allowing an attacker to probe the existence of arbitrary files on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain knowledge about the file system structure and the presence of specific files on the user's machine. This information can be used to further exploit vulnerabilities or gather intelligence about the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Java Applet:** An attacker can embed a malicious Java applet within a web page. When a user visits this page, the applet can probe the file system.
- **Untrusted Application:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability in an untrusted Java application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to deliver and execute malicious Java code on the target system.
- The attacker can be remote (via the web) or local (via an untrusted application).
- The attacker does not need any special privileges but is limited to the user context in which the Java code is executed.

**Additional Technical Details (from Bugzilla):**

- The vulnerability is described as an "information leakage vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with color profiles."
- The attacker can exploit this flaw "by checking whether the returned value of `ICC_Profile.getInstance` with a returns a null for a given file name that has a directory traversal prefix (like ../blabla.pf)."
- The information leakage is considered "a borderline case" due to the fact that `java.io.File` allows to acquire the same information easily. However, the fix reduces the privileged block to read color profile which further decreases the generic attack surface.

In summary, CVE-2009-3728 is an information disclosure vulnerability that allows an attacker to probe the file system for the existence of files using a maliciously crafted Java applet or application by exploiting directory traversal through `ICC_Profile` file handling.
