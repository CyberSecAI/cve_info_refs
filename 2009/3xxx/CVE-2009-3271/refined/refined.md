{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing an excessively long string to the `tel:` URI scheme within an `<iframe>` tag. This appears to cause a buffer overflow or similar issue when Safari attempts to process the oversized data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition that arises from improper handling of long strings in a URI context.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation results in a crash of the Safari browser on the iPhone, leading to a temporary denial of service for the user. The phone screen turns black. This does not allow further use of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted web page that contains an `<iframe>` tag with a `tel:` URI that includes an unusually large string of characters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to host a malicious web page that a user can visit with their iPhone using Safari. No special privileges or authentication is needed."
