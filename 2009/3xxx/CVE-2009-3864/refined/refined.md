{
  "CVE-2009-3864": {
    "Root cause": "The Java Update functionality in Java Runtime Environment (JRE), when a non-English version of Windows is used, does not retrieve available new JRE versions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The Java Update mechanism fails to check for newer versions of JRE on non-English Windows systems."
    ],
    "Impact": "Allows remote attackers to leverage vulnerabilities in older releases of Java software since updates are not being retrieved/applied.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in older versions of Java."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to exploit known vulnerabilities present in outdated versions of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)."
