How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- expat
The previous expat security update (CVE-2009-3560) caused parse
errors with some xml documents.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0-11.2
- postfix
The post install script of postfix accidentally let postfix listen
on all network interfaces (CVE-2010-0230).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3
- phpMyAdmin
The use of unserialize() on POST data which could have lead to
remote code execution (CVE-2009-4605) has been fixed as well as some
minor temporary file issues (CVE-2008-7251, CVE-2008-7252).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- postgresql
An unprivileged, authenticated PostgreSQL user could create a table
which references functions with malicious content. Maintenance
operations carried out be the database superuser could execute such
functions (CVE-2009-4136).
Embedded null bytes in the common name of SSL certificates could
bypass certificate hostname checks (CVE-2009-4034).
postgresql was updated to the next upstream patchlevel update which
also includes several bugfixes. See the package changelog for
details.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0-11.2
- dovecot12
Dovecot created the configured 'base\_dir' (/var/run/dovecot) with
mode 0777 if it didn't exist, therefore allowing local users to mess
with e.g. the authentication socket (CVE-2009-3897).
Note that /var/run/dovecot is part of the dovecot rpm with proper
permission settings. Therefor dovecot is not vulnerable in the
default configuration as shipped on openSUSE.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- msmtp
msmtp did not properly handle a '\0' character in the domain name of
SSL certificates (CVE-2009-3942).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0-11.2

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Hi Josh, Steve, vendors,

   Dovecot upstream has released latest 1.2.8 version, fixing
one security issue. Quoting from news:

This is mainly to fix the 0777 base_dir creation issue, which could be
considered a security hole, exploitable by local users. An attacker
could for example replace Dovecot's auth socket and log in as other
users. Gaining root privileges isn't possible though.

This affects only v1.2 users, v1.1 and older versions were creating the
directory with 0755 permission.

Could you allocate a CVE id? (in case there isn't one already).

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

Hello.

<http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot-news/2009-November/000143.html>

<http://dovecot.org/releases/1.2/dovecot-1.2.8.tar.gz>
<http://dovecot.org/releases/1.2/dovecot-1.2.8.tar.gz.sig>

This is mainly to fix the 0777 base_dir creation issue, which could be
considered a security hole, exploitable by local users. An attacker
could for example replace Dovecot's auth socket and log in as other
users. Gaining root privileges isn't possible though.

This affects only v1.2 users, v1.1 and older versions were creating the
directory with 0755 permission.

If your Dovecot's base_dir isn't in /var/run/dovecot/, you should also
make sure that the $prefix/var/ and $prefix/var/run/
(i.e. /usr/local/var/, /usr/local/var/run/ by default) aren't 0777.

	* Dovecot v1.2.x had been creating base_dir (and its parents if
	  necessary) with 0777 permissions. The base_dir's permissions get
	  changed to 0755 automatically at startup, but you may need to
	  chmod the parent directories manually.

	- acl: If user has rights from more than one group, merge them instead
	  of choosing one group's rights and ignoring others.
	- virtual: When using a lot of mailboxes, the virtual mailbox's header
	  could have grown over 32 kB and caused "out of memory" crashes. Also
	  over 64 kB headers couldn't even be updated with existing transaction
	  log records. Added a new record type that gets used with >=64 kB
	  headers. Older Dovecot versions don't understand this header and
	  will log errors if they see it.
	- FETCH BODYSTRUCTURE didn't return RFC 2231 "key*" fields correctly

This is mainly to fix the 0777 base_dir creation issue, which could be
considered a security hole, exploitable by local users. An attacker
could for example replace Dovecot's auth socket and log in as other
users. Gaining root privileges isn't possible though.

This affects only v1.2 users, v1.1 and older versions were creating the
directory with 0755 permission.

If your Dovecot's base_dir isn't in /var/run/dovecot/, you should also
make sure that the $prefix/var/ and $prefix/var/run/
(i.e. /usr/local/var/, /usr/local/var/run/ by default) aren't 0777.

	* Dovecot v1.2.x had been creating base_dir (and its parents if
	  necessary) with 0777 permissions. The base_dir's permissions get
	  changed to 0755 automatically at startup, but you may need to
	  chmod the parent directories manually.

	- acl: If user has rights from more than one group, merge them instead
	  of choosing one group's rights and ignoring others.
	- virtual: When using a lot of mailboxes, the virtual mailbox's header
	  could have grown over 32 kB and caused "out of memory" crashes. Also
	  over 64 kB headers couldn't even be updated with existing transaction
	  log records. Added a new record type that gets used with >=64 kB
	  headers. Older Dovecot versions don't understand this header and
	  will log errors if they see it.
	- FETCH BODYSTRUCTURE didn't return RFC 2231 "key*" fields correctly
