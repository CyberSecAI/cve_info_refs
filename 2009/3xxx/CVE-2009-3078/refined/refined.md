  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Incorrect rendering of certain Unicode font characters, specifically Mathematical Script Small k (U+1D4C2) and long leftward arrow (U+27F5), which have a tall line-height. This causes the rest of the text in the location bar to be scrolled vertically out of view.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect font rendering",
       "Lack of proper input validation/sanitization",
      "Scrollable text fields exposing more than the expected area"

    "impact": "Spoofing attacks on the location bar, where a malicious URL could be obscured, replaced or hidden from the user's view, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a URL containing specific Unicode characters that cause the location bar to render incorrectly.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with specific unicode characters.  No specific user interaction beyond simply visiting the crafted URL. No specific privilege is needed."
