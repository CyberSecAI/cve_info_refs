Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The S2 Security Netbox/Linear eMerge Access Control System management component can be reset to its factory configuration through a specially crafted URI without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unauthenticated Factory Reset:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of authentication for the factory reset functionality.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The crafted URI directly triggers the reset function without any authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack leads to the management component being reset to its factory defaults, rendering it non-functional and removing it from the network (loss of IP address). This disrupts the management of the access control system.
*  **Loss of Functionality:** The management console becomes unusable, although the node components controlling door locks, etc., continue to operate in a standalone mode.
*   **Potential Secondary Impacts:** While the vulnerability itself causes a DoS, the management console would need to be restored from a database backup, meaning the access control system will be offline for some time and the restore process may be disruptive.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted URI to the vulnerable management component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the management component of the eMerge system.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to perform the factory reset.
*   **Local Network:** Although not explicitly stated, the mention of "local unauthenticated attacker" suggests that the attacker is likely within the same network as the vulnerable device.

**Additional Notes (from Slideshare presentation):**
*   The presentation highlights additional vulnerabilities including:
    *   **Unauthenticated access to database backups:** Attackers can download nightly backups using a predictable file naming convention.
    *   **Extraction of administrator hash:**  The database contains an admin hash that can be cracked to gain admin access.
    *   **Access to camera and DVR credentials:** Backups contain credentials for IP cameras and DVRs, giving attackers control of those devices.
    *   **Use of insecure protocols**: The system utilizes FTP and Telnet.
    *   **Use of outdated software**: It uses an old version of MySQL (v4.0) and the vulnerable GoAhead webserver.

**Affected Versions:**
* Software versions 2.5.x are reported to be affected.

**Mitigation:**
*   The vendor, S2 Security, has released patches or upgrades to address the issue.
*   Users are advised to contact S2 or Linear customer support for updates.

**CVE Information:**
*   CVE ID: CVE-2009-3734
*   Public Disclosure Date: 2010-01-04
