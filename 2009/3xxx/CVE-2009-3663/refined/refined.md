Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `h_readrequest()` function within the `http.cpp` file of the `httpdx` web server. Specifically, a format string vulnerability occurs due to the usage of `snprintf` with the `client->host` variable without proper sanitization: `snprintf(temp[1],MAX,client->host)`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The `client->host` value, which is directly taken from the HTTP Host header, is used as the format string argument in `snprintf`. This allows an attacker to inject format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`, etc.) into the Host header, which will then be interpreted by `snprintf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting a carefully crafted format string, an attacker can crash the server leading to a denial of service. The provided exploit demonstrates this by using `%s` repeatedly.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Host Header:** The attack vector is the HTTP Host header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any prior authentication. They simply need to send a malicious HTTP request with a crafted Host header.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable webserver.

**Additional Information**

* The provided exploit code uses Perl's LWP library to send the malicious HTTP request and demonstrates the successful crash of the server.
* The exploit targets httpdx version 1.4 on Windows.
