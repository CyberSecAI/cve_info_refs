Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in TYPO3-SA-2009-016, which is related to CVE-2009-3628:

**Root Cause:** The root causes of the vulnerabilities stem from insufficient input sanitization, insecure authentication/session handling, and allowing arbitrary inclusion of websites in backend framesets, all within the TYPO3 CMS core.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Malicious content in a `tt_content` form element allows a backend user to recalculate the encryption key.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Several areas within the TYPO3 backend, frontend login box, and Install Tool lack proper sanitization of user input and URL parameters, allowing for XSS attacks. Additionally, the `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue` API function has an insufficient sanitization algorithm.
*   **Frame Hijacking:** Manipulation of URL parameters enables the inclusion of arbitrary websites in TYPO3 backend framesets.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** Uploading files with crafted filenames can lead to arbitrary shell command execution on the server, especially when third-party extensions are used or if file uploads occur outside of the fillist module.
*   **SQL Injection:**  The frontend editing feature is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of URL parameters.
*   **Insecure Install Tool Authentication/Session Handling:** Access to the Install Tool can be gained by knowing only the MD5 hash of the Install Tool password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive encryption keys, compromising security mechanisms.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts, leading to unauthorized actions on behalf of users, session hijacking, and potential data theft.
*   **Frame Hijacking:** Attackers can trick users into interacting with malicious content displayed within the context of the TYPO3 backend, potentially leading to credential theft or other malicious activities.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** Complete control over the server can be achieved, leading to data breaches, server compromise, and denial of service.
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to databases, modify data, or gain further system access.
*    **Insecure Install Tool Authentication/Session Handling**: Attackers can gain full access to the install tool, which is the primary administrative interface of TYPO3, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Backend:** Through malicious input in `tt_content` form elements, manipulated URL parameters, or malicious file uploads.
*   **Frontend:** Through manipulated URL parameters in the frontend editing feature or the frontend login box.
*   **API function:** Through malicious input where `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue` is used.
*   **Install Tool:** Through the knowledge of the Install Tool password's MD5 hash or through manipulated URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Backend access:**  A valid backend login is required for exploiting vulnerabilities related to information disclosure, XSS, frame hijacking and remote command execution within the TYPO3 backend.
*   **Frontend editing enabled:** Exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability requires a valid backend login with activated frontend editing
*   **No specific access:** Exploiting the XSS vulnerability in the `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue` API function does not require any specific authentication.
*   **Install Tool access**: The attacker must gain knowledge of the Install Tool password's MD5 hash to exploit the insecure authentication vulnerability and must be able to access the install tool itself to exploit the XSS vulnerabilities.

In summary, this security advisory highlights a number of serious vulnerabilities that could be exploited by both authenticated backend users or unauthenticated users in some cases, allowing for a wide range of attacks on TYPO3 CMS installations.
