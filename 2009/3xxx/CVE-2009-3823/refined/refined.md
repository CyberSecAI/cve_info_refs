```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user input when handling the 'page' parameter in the 'getthememyhtml' function, allowing for directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Disclosure due to lack of input sanitization leading to directory traversal.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the 'page' parameter. In the provided example, the attacker is able to read the `config.inc.php` file.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the 'myhtml.php' script, specifically by manipulating the `GLOBALS[page]` parameter. The attacker uses the GLOBALS[] array to bypass any checks on the `_GET` variables.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. They do not need any prior access or credentials."
