Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in MUJE CMS 1.0.4.34. This is due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `_class`, `url`, and `_htmlfile` parameters within the `admin.php` and `install.php` files, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input, allowing an attacker to include local files by manipulating the `_class`, `url`, and `_htmlfile` parameters.
- Path traversal: The vulnerability allows path traversal using relative paths like `../../../../../../` to access files outside of the intended directories.
- Null byte injection: The use of `%00` in the `_class` parameter shows an attempt to terminate the file path, allowing for bypassing file extension checks (if any).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file access: An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, and system files.
- Information disclosure: Leaked sensitive information can be used to gain further access or compromise the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests: The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted GET requests to `admin.php` and `install.php`.
- Vulnerable parameters: The vulnerable parameters are `_class`, `url`, and `_htmlfile`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable MUJE CMS instance.
- No authentication (for some vectors): The exploit does not require admin authentication for the `_class` and `url` parameters, but does require admin login to use `_htmlfile` paramater.
