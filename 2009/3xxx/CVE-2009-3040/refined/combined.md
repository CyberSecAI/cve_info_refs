# Multiple SQL Injections In OCS Inventory NG

```

OCS Inventory NG - Multiple SQL Injections                          May 30 2009
_______________________________________________________________________________

* Product

  Open Computer and Software (OCS) Inventory NG

* Vulnerable Versions

  OCS Inventory NG 1.02 (Unix)

* Vendor Status

  Vendor has been notified and the vulnerability has been fixed.

* Details

  The Open Computer and Software (OCS) Inventory Next Generation (NG) provides
  relevant inventory information about system configurations and software on
  the network. The server can be managed using a web interface.
  It was found that the application does not properly sanitize user input
  which results into multiple SQL injections.

  Affected are the following scripts:

  - download.php (parameters `N', `DL', `O' and `V')
  - group_show.php (parameter `SYSTEMID');

* Impact

  Attackers may be able to manipulate SQL statements in such a way that they
  can retrieve, create or modify information stored in the database.
  Furthermore, the SQL injection might allow attackers to get a foothold on the
  underlying system.

* Exploit

  The vulnerability can be exploited by just using a web browser:

	http://example.org/ocsreports/download.php?n=1&dl=2&o=3&v=4'union+all+select+concat(id,':',passwd)+from+operators%23

## specifics of solution

### Inventory management

Since 2001, **OCS Inventory** has been looking to make hardware and software inventory of computers more efficient. OCS Inventory queries its **agents** to know the **soft and hard composition** of each machine, each server. OCS Inventory also queries the network to discover the active elements that cannot receive an agent. Since version 2.0, OCS Inventory integrates the functionality of **SNMP scans**.

The main purpose of this integration is to complement the data collected by **ipdiscover.** Using SNMP scans will allow you to insert a lot of information about your network hardware: printers, switches, computers (which do not have an OCS agent installed), etc. SNMP scans will be performed by OCS agents based on IP addresses collected by ipdiscover.

### The remote deployment

**OCS Inventory** includes the **package deployment** feature, in order not to control, but to ensure uniformity of the software environments present on the network. From the central management server, you can upload the packets that will be downloaded using HTTP/HTTPS and launched by the **agent** on the client computer. OCS remote deployment is configurable so that sent packets impact the network’s quality of service as little as possible. OCS is used as a deployment tool on parks with **more than 150 000 machines**.
