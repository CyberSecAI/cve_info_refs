Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-3094:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `mod_proxy_ftp` module of the Apache HTTP Server.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  The `ap_proxy_ftp_handler` function in `modules/proxy/proxy_ftp.c` is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference. This occurs when the module receives a malformed reply to an EPSV command from a remote FTP server, or a PASV command when the FTP server doesn't implement EPSV.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit leads to a crash of the Apache child process handling the request.
    *   In a default `prefork` MPM setup, this only terminates the specific child process handling the malicious request, not causing a full server DoS, and only breaks the current request served by this child.
    *   With a multi-threaded `worker` MPM, a crash of a child process can affect multiple concurrent requests handled by that child.
*   **Unauthorized Access** -  According to HP bulletin, the vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access, however, this is not detailed in other documents.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by a malicious FTP server.
*  **Malicious FTP Server:** The attacker controls an FTP server that provides malformed responses to EPSV and PASV commands.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable Apache server via an FTP proxy configuration using mod_proxy_ftp.
*   **Malicious FTP Server:**  The attacker must control or have access to an FTP server.

**Additional Notes from Content:**

*   **Mitigation:** Disabling the `mod_proxy_ftp` module serves as a workaround.
*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects various versions of Apache-based web servers, including those on HP-UX, OpenVMS, and Linux systems. It affects Apache 2.0.x and 2.2.x.
*   **Vendor Patches:** Patches were released by HP, IBM, and Debian (among others) to address this issue in their respective products. The fix includes improved input validation to prevent the NULL pointer dereference.
*  **CVSS Score:** The CVSS score from HP is 5.4(AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
*   **Red Hat:**  Red Hat considers the impact to be low because the child process crash will only affect one request at a time, and because the proxy is typically used as a reverse proxy where the proxied server is trusted.
