  "CVE-2009-3170": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "AIMP2 Audio Converter is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to a Unicode overflow when processing .pls or .m3u playlist files.",
    "details": [
      {
        "type": "Root cause",
        "detail": "The vulnerability is caused by a Unicode overflow when the application processes specially crafted .pls or .m3u playlist files. Specifically, an overly long sequence of 'A' characters in the playlist file triggers the overflow."
      },
      {
        "type": "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities",
        "detail": "The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when handling Unicode strings in playlist files."
      },
       {
        "type": "Impact of exploitation",
        "detail": "Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the application to crash.  The exploit code comments hint at a potential for code execution through SEH overwrite, but this exploit example only demonstrates the crash."
      },
      {
        "type": "Attack vectors",
        "detail": "The attack vector is a malformed .pls or .m3u playlist file.  An attacker must provide the user with such a file for them to open in the vulnerable software."
      },
      {
        "type": "Required attacker capabilities/position",
         "detail": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious playlist file with a long sequence of Unicode characters and have a user open it with a vulnerable version of AIMP2. No special network access or authentication is needed."
