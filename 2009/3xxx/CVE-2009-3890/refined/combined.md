# WordPress 2.8.6 Security Release

---

2.8.6 fixes two security problems that can be exploited by registered, logged in users who have posting privileges.  If you have untrusted authors on your blog, upgrading to 2.8.6 is recommended.

The first problem is an XSS vulnerability in Press This discovered by Benjamin Flesch.  The second problem, discovered by Dawid Golunski, is an issue with sanitizing uploaded file names that can be exploited in certain Apache configurations. Thanks to Benjamin and Dawid for finding and reporting these.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Intriguing behaviour as really only the last part after the last dot is the extension IMHO

should we not just replace all dots bar the last one in the filename?

I'd rather not munge .tar.gz, for example.

The patch turns .php.jpg into .php\_.jpg. .php.jpg.jpg into .php\_.jpg.jpg. Anything that looks like an extension (a dot followed by [a-zA-Z]{2,5}\d?) that is not in the whitelist is munged by appending an underscore.

Better fix for people with vulnerable hosts. Add this to the top of the root .htaccess file:

```
RemoveHandler application/x-httpd-php .php
<FilesMatch "\.php$|\.php5$|\.php4$|\.php3$|\.phtml$|\.phpt$">
  SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
<FilesMatch "\.phps$">
 SetHandler application/x-httpd-php-source
</FilesMatch>

```

This will remove the problem. Verified on a vulnerable shared web host (which shall remain nameless for now).

Tip that we should tell all web hosts: Don't use AddHandler.

This (or similar) is the vulnerability:

```
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php

```

This is the correct way to do it:

```
<FilesMatch "\.php$|\.php5$|\.php4$|\.php3$|\.phtml$|\.phpt$">
  SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
<FilesMatch "\.phps$">
 SetHandler application/x-httpd-php-source
</FilesMatch>

```

Hey,

Wordpress released an update, fixing 2 issues:

"2.8.6 fixes two security problems that can be exploited by registered,
logged in users who have posting privileges.  If you have untrusted
authors on your blog, upgrading to 2.8.6 is recommended.

The first problem is an XSS vulnerability in Press This discovered by
Benjamin Flesch.  The second problem, discovered by Dawid Golunski, is
an issue with sanitizing uploaded file names that can be exploited in
certain Apache configurations. Thanks to Benjamin and Dawid for finding
and reporting these."
