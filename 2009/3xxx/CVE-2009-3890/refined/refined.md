Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-3890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an issue in how WordPress sanitizes uploaded file names, specifically when dealing with filenames containing multiple extensions.
*   Certain Apache configurations could be tricked into executing a file as a PHP script even if it had a double extension like "foo.php.jpg" due to a misconfiguration using `AddHandler` instead of `FilesMatch`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `wp_check_filetype()` function in `wp-includes/functions.php` did not properly sanitize filenames with multiple extensions.
*   **Server Configuration Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by specific Apache server configurations that use `AddHandler` which associates all files with an extension with a handler.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could upload a file with a double extension (e.g., `evil.php.jpg`). Due to the vulnerability, a misconfigured Apache server could execute the file as PHP code, leading to arbitrary code execution. This would allow the attacker to compromise the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The attack vector is through the file upload mechanism in WordPress, which allows registered users with posting privileges to upload files.
*   **Apache Misconfiguration:** Successful exploitation relies on the presence of a specific Apache misconfiguration using `AddHandler` rather than `FilesMatch`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User:** The attacker must be a registered user with posting privileges.
*   **Vulnerable Apache Configuration:** The target server must have the vulnerable Apache configuration described above.

**Mitigation:**

* WordPress 2.8.6 was released to address this vulnerability, which included a change to sanitize filenames with multiple extensions.
* Additionally, the fix also includes a suggestion to use `<FilesMatch>` with `SetHandler` for safer php handling.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The fix involves munging intermediate extensions by adding an underscore.
*   The vulnerable configuration is caused by an `AddHandler` directive in the Apache configuration.
*   The correct method is to use the `<FilesMatch>` and `SetHandler` directives in the Apache config.

**Summary of CVE-2009-3890:**

The CVE-2009-3890 refers to an arbitrary code execution vulnerability in WordPress 2.8.5 (and earlier) caused by insufficient sanitization of uploaded filenames coupled with a common Apache misconfiguration. Attackers could exploit this by uploading malicious files with double extensions and achieving code execution on the server.
