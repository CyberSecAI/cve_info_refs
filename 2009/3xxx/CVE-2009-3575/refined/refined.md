- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow exists in the DHT (Distributed Hash Table) routing code of aria2.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The vulnerability could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered locally or remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker could exploit the vulnerability through network interactions that involve the DHT routing code or potentially by manipulating specific inputs when running aria2 locally.
