The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde
Application Framework version 3.2.5.

This is a major security release that fixes a vulnerability in the form
library that allows overwriting of arbitrary local files with the permissions
of the web server user. It also fixes two XSS vulnerabilities in the
preference system and the MIME viewer library. The local file vulnerability
can only be exploited when running an application that uses image form fields,
like Turba H3 (2.3) or Ansel, and only by users who have write permissions to
those applications. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this release.

Thanks to Stefan Esser from SektionEins for finding the local file issue in a
code audit, and Martin Geisler and David Wharton for finding the XSS issues.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP.  It provides an extensive array of classes that are
targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in developing modern web
applications.

The major changes compared to the Horde version 3.2.4 are:
     * Fixed vulnerability in image form fields that allows overwriting of
       arbitrary local files.
     * Fixed validation of "number" type preferences.
     * Fixed displaying unknown text MIME parts inline.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1897-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                                 Nico Golde
September 28th, 2009                    <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>

Package        : horde3
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : #547318
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-3236

Stefan Esser discovered that Horde, a web application framework providing
classes for dealing with preferences, compression, browser detection,
connection tracking, MIME, and more, is insufficiently validating and
escaping user provided input.  The Horde_Form_Type_image form element
allows to reuse a temporary filename on reuploads which are stored in a
hidden HTML field and then trusted without prior validation.  An attacker
can use this to overwrite arbitrary files on the system or to upload PHP
code and thus execute arbitrary code with the rights of the webserver.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.3-4etch6.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.2+debian0-2+lenny1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.5+debian0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.5+debian0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your horde3 packages.
