{
  "CVE-2009-3238": {
    "Description": "The get_random_int function in drivers/char/random.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.30 produces insufficiently random numbers, which allows attackers to predict the return value, and possibly defeat protection mechanisms based on randomization, via vectors that leverage the function's tendency to \"return the same value over and over again for long stretches of time.\"",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The get_random_int function in drivers/char/random.c produces insufficiently random numbers.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) used by `get_random_int` was not generating sufficiently random numbers.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers could predict the return value of the function, potentially bypassing protection mechanisms that rely on randomization.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attackers could leverage the predictable output of the function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to invoke functions that use `get_random_int`."
