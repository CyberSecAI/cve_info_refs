| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-09-07 14:14:53 UTC  ``` Yorick Koster discovered multiple security issues in yTNEF and Evolution's TNEF plugin (based on yTNEF), which are described in oCERT-2009-013 advisory:    <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2009-013.html>    yTNEF, an open source filter program that decodes Transport Neutral   Encapsulation Format (TNEF) e-mail attachments, and the Evolution TNEF   attachment decoder plugin suffer from directory traversal and buffer   overflow vulnerabilities.    The vulnerabilities lead to arbitrary code execution with the privilege   of the target user running the decoders.    The directory traversal vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization   of the file name used for saving the attachments, as it is computed   directly from properties contained in the TNEF structure without checking   for conditions that allow to traverse outside the temporary directory   used for attachment storage. This leads to arbitrary code execution in   case the attacker crafts an attachment that would overwrite a file used   for execution (as an example the bashrc profile).    Additionally buffer and heap overflow vulnerabilities can be triggered by   passing a file name exceeding a fixed size of 256 bytes in the TNEF data   structure. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited.  Further details can be found in Yorick's advisory:   <http://www.akitasecurity.nl/advisory.php?id=AK20090601>  There's no official upstream fix for the issues.  Both yTNEF and Evolution's TNEF plugin are unmaintained according to oCERT's advisory.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2009-09-07 14:19:33 UTC  ``` Evolution's TNEF plugin requires libytnef.  This library is not available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, hence Evolution packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5 are not affected by this problem.  libytnef is available in Fedora, but we do not seem to build TNEF Evolution plugin in any current Fedora version (F10 - F12), so Fedora Evolution packages are unaffected too.  ytnef is currently on it's way to Fedora - see Review Request [bug #485403](show_bug.cgi?id=485403 "CLOSED ERRATA - Review Request: ytnef - Yerase's TNEF Stream Reader.").   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c2)  Vincent Danen    2009-10-27 21:46:35 UTC  ``` There still is no CVE for this issue, so I've requested one: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/10/27/5>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c3)  Vincent Danen    2009-10-28 14:08:43 UTC  ``` This has been given the name [CVE-2009-3721](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3721)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c4)  Vincent Danen    2010-03-09 20:56:50 UTC  ``` [CVE-2009-3721](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3721) is for the buffer overflow, [CVE-2009-3887](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3887) is for the directory traversal.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c5)  Vincent Danen    2010-04-09 20:42:51 UTC  ``` This issue did not affect Fedora previously, but it does now (Fedora 12 and higher):  * Thu Jul 02 2009 Matthew Barnes <mbarnes> - 2.27.3-4.fc12 - Add BR for libpst-devel and libytnef-devel (RH [bug #493049](show_bug.cgi?id=493049 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - Can't import pst-files in Evolution")).  There still does not seem to be an upstream fixes for either libytnef or evolution that I can see.  Debian removed libytnef from their distribution on 20100214 in order to correct this flaw.

**oCERT-2009-013 yTNEF/Evolution TNEF attachment decoder input sanitization errors**

**Description**:

[yTNEF](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ytnef), an open
source filter program that decodes Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format
(TNEF) e-mail attachments, and the [Evolution](http://projects.gnome.org/evolution) TNEF attachment
decoder plugin suffer from directory traversal and buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities lead to arbitrary code execution with the privilege
of the target user running the decoders.

The directory traversal vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization
of the file name used for saving the attachments, as it is computed directly
from properties contained in the TNEF structure without checking for conditions
that allow to traverse outside the temporary directory used for attachment
storage. This leads to arbitrary code execution in case the attacker crafts an
attachment that would overwrite a file used for execution (as an example the
bashrc profile).

Additionally buffer and heap overflow vulnerabilities can be triggered
by passing a file name exceeding a fixed size of 256 bytes in the TNEF data
structure. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited.

**Affected version**:

[yTNEF](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ytnef), all versions

[Evolution](http://projects.gnome.org/evolution) TNEF plugin, all versions

**Fixed version**:

[yTNEF](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ytnef), N/A

[Evolution](http://projects.gnome.org/evolution) TNEF plugin, N/A

**Credit**: vulnerability report and PoC code received from Yorick
Koster < yorick [at] akitasecurity [dot] nl >.

**CVE**: [CVE-2009-3721](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3721) (buffer overflow), [CVE-2009-3887](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3887) (directory traversal)

**Timeline**:

2009-07-09: vulnerability report received

2009-07-10: contacted ytnef and evolution maintainers

2009-07-11: former evolution plugin maintainer communicates that code is unmaintained, voluntarily deletes online copy

2009-07-21: contacted affected vendors, advising to remove or disable the unmaintained code

2009-09-05: advisory release

2009-10-28: assigned CVE

2009-11-06: assigned separate CVE for traversal issue

**References**:

### @Yeraze **[Yeraze](/Yeraze)** commented [Aug 1, 2014](#issue-39295187)

A basic attempt to fix [CVE-2009-3721](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2qr8-v7fq-qr4p "CVE-2009-3721"), a buffer overflow exploit in filename handling.

This also fixes *lots* of compiler warnings, and adds some basic tests for Travis to run just for basic regression testing.

Addresses [#7](https://github.com/Yeraze/ytnef/issues/7)

Sorry, something went wrong.
