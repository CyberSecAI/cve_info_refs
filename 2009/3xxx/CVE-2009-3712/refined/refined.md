Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the "Ebay Clone 2009" application. This means that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection in multiple locations within the application:
    *   `feedback.php` (GET parameter `user_id`)
    *   `view_full_size.php` (GET parameter `item_id`)
    *   `classifide_ad.php` (GET parameter `item_id`)
    *   `crosspromoteitems.php` (GET parameter `item_id`) - Blind SQL Injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach/Data Exposure:** Attackers can use SQL injection to read sensitive data from the database, potentially exposing user information, passwords, and other confidential details.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Malicious SQL queries can also be used to modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Complete Database Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers could potentially gain complete control over the database server.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** Allows exfiltration of data based on responses.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vectors are through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable PHP scripts: `feedback.php`, `view_full_size.php`, `classifide_ad.php`, and `crosspromoteitems.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. This typically means the attacker can be any user who can reach the application's web server.
*   No special privileges on the server or inside the database server are necessary to exploit these flaws.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit details provided in the exploit-db content offers specific examples of vulnerable URLs using `UNION SELECT` statements.
*   The exploit-db content specifies that the application is "Ebay Clone 2009".
*   The "Blind SQL injection" for `crosspromoteitems.php` indicates that the attacker can send a query, but they would not receive data directly back, instead they must infer data based on different responses.

The information in the Exploit-DB entry provides more details and specific attack vectors compared to the general CVE description.
