Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-3548:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Windows installer for Apache Tomcat versions prior to 6.0.24 (as stated in the tomcat.apache.org content) defaulted to a blank password for the administrative user. This was also present in HP Performance Manager v8.10, v8.20, and v8.21.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure default configuration:** A default installation of Apache Tomcat on Windows would create an "admin" user with administrative and manager roles with a blank password.
*   **Weak credential:** Leaving the administrative user with no password, thereby allowing unauthorized access.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain full administrative access to the Apache Tomcat server or HP Performance Manager due to the default blank password.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With administrative access, an attacker can deploy malicious web applications, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Unauthorized Modification:** An attacker could modify server configurations, deploy or undeploy applications and other administrative tasks.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** With full access an attacker could deny legitimate access to the server.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the network, as the administrator interface is generally accessible over the network.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the server's web interface (often over HTTP/HTTPS).
*   **Knowledge of default credentials:** The attacker needs to be aware of the default blank password for the admin user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically noted in multiple sources as affecting HP Performance Manager versions 8.10, 8.20, and 8.21, running on HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, and Windows, and Apache Tomcat before version 6.0.24.
*   The vulnerability is given a CVSS base score of 7.5 in the HP bulletin, indicating a high severity.
*   Multiple vendors, like VMware, also included this CVE in their security advisories due to the use of vulnerable Apache Tomcat versions in their products, including vCenter Server, vCenter Update Manager, ESXi, and ESX.
*   The resolution for this vulnerability is to set a strong password for the administrative user (admin) and update affected software.
*   The Apache Tomcat Security Report (tomcat.apache.org) explicitly mentions that the vulnerability was resolved in revision 881771, with the fix included in Apache Tomcat 6.0.24.
