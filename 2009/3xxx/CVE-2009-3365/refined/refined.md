```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `install.plugin.php` script in Aurora CMS includes a file based on a user-supplied parameter `AURORA_MODULES_FOLDER`.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The script includes files based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include remote files, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific URL with the `AURORA_MODULES_FOLDER` parameter pointing to a malicious file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and host a malicious file.
