##### 3. Problem Description

a. Windows-based VMware Tools Unsafe Library Loading vulnerability

A vulnerability in the way VMware libraries are referenced allows for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. This vulnerability is present only on Windows Guest Operating Systems.
In order for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need to lure the user that is logged on a Windows Guest Operating System to click on the attacker's file on a network share. This file could be in any file format. The attacker will need to have the ability to host their malicious files on a network share.
VMware would like to thank Jure Skofic and Mitja Kolsek of ACROS Security ( <http://www.acrossecurity.com>) for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-1141 to this issue.
Steps needed to remediate this vulnerability:
- Install the remediated version of Workstation, Player, ACE, Server and Fusion.
- Upgrade tools in the virtual machine (virtual machine users will be prompted to upgrade).

Guest systems on ESX 4.0, 3.5, 3.0.3, 2.5.5, ESXi 4.0, 3.5 - Install the relevant patches (see below for patch identifiers)
- Manually upgrade tools in the virtual machine (virtual machine users will not be prompted to upgrade). Note the VI Client will not show the VMware tools is out of date in the summary tab.
Please see <http://tinyurl.com/27mpjo>Â page 80 for details.

b. Windows-based VMware Tools Arbitrary Code Execution vulnerability

A vulnerability in the way VMware executables are loaded allows for arbitrary code execution in the context of the logged on user. This vulnerability is present only on Windows Guest Operating Systems.

In order for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need to be able to plant their malicious executable in a certain location on the Virtual Machine of the user. On most recent versions of Windows (XP, Vista) the attacker would need to have administrator privileges to plant the malicious executable in the right location.

Steps needed to remediate this vulnerability: See section 3.a.

VMware would like to thank Mitja Kolsek of ACROS Security (<http://www.acrossecurity.com>) for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-1142 to this issue.

Refer to the previous table in section 3.a for what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available. See above for remediation details.

#####

c. Windows-based VMware Workstation and Player host privilege

A vulnerability in the USB service allows for a privilege escalation. A local attacker on the host of a Windows-based Operating System where VMware Workstation or VMware Player is installed could plant a malicious executable on the host and elevate their privileges.
In order for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need to be able to plant their malicious executable in a certain location on the host machine. On most recent versions of Windows (XP, Vista) the attacker would need to have administrator privileges to plant the malicious executable in the right location.
VMware would like to thank Thierry Zoller for reporting this issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2010-1140 to this issue.

#####

d. Third party library update for libpng to version 1.2.37

The libpng libraries through 1.2.35 contain an uninitialized- memory-read bug that may have security implications. Specifically, 1-bit (2-color) interlaced images whose widths are not divisible by 8 may result in several uninitialized bits at the end of certain rows in certain interlace passes being returned to the user. An application that failed to mask these out-of-bounds pixels might display or process them, albeit presumably with benign results in most cases.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2009-2042 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.

e. VMware VMnc Codec heap overflow vulnerabilities

The VMware movie decoder contains the VMnc media codec that is required to play back movies recorded with VMware Workstation, VMware Player and VMware ACE, in any compatible media player. The movie decoder is installed as part of VMware Workstation, VMware Player and VMware ACE, or can be downloaded as a stand alone package.
Vulnerabilities in the decoder allow for execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running an application utilizing the vulnerable codec.
For an attack to be successful the user must be tricked into visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious video file on a system that has the vulnerable version of the VMnc codec installed.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CVE-2009-1564 and CVE-2009-1565 to these issues.
VMware would like to thank iDefense, Sebastien Renaud of VUPEN Vulnerability Research Team ( <http://www.vupen.com>) and Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research for reporting these issues to us.
To remediate the above issues either install the stand alone movie decoder or update your product using the table below.

f. VMware Remote Console format string vulnerability

VMware Remote Console (VMrc) contains a format string vulnerability. Exploitation of this issue may lead to arbitrary code execution on the system where VMrc is installed.

For an attack to be successful, an attacker would need to trick the VMrc user into opening a malicious Web page or following a malicious URL. Code execution would be at the privilege level of the user.

VMrc is present on a system if the VMrc browser plug-in has been installed. This plug-in is required when using the console feature in WebAccess. Installation of the plug-in follows after visiting the console tab in WebAccess and choosing "Install plug-in". The plug- in can only be installed on Internet Explorer and Firefox.

Under the following two conditions your version of VMrc is likely to be affected:

- the VMrc plug-in was obtained from vCenter 4.0 or from ESX 4.0 without patch ESX400-200911223-UG and
- VMrc is installed on a Windows-based system

The following steps allow you to determine if you have an affected version of VMrc installed:

- Locate the VMrc executable vmware-vmrc.exe on your Windows-based system
- Right click and go to Properties
- Go to the tab "Versions"
- Click "File Version" in the "Item Name" window
- If the "Value" window shows "e.x.p build-158248", the version of VMrc is affected

Remediation of this issue on Windows-based systems requires the following steps (Linux-based systems are not affected):

- Uninstall affected versions of VMrc from the systems where the VMrc plug-in has been installed (use the Windows Add/Remove Programs interface)
- Install vCenter 4.0 Update 1 or install the ESX 4.0 patch ESX400-200911223-UG
- Login into vCenter 4.0 Update 1 or ESX 4.0 with patch ESX400-200911223-UG using WebAccess on the system where the VMrc needs to be re-installed
- Re-install VMrc by going to the console tab in WebAccess. The Console tab is selectable after selecting a virtual machine.

Note: the VMrc plug-in for Firefox on Windows-based operating systems is no longer compatible after the above remediation steps. Users are advised to use the Internet Explorer VMrc plug-in.

VMware would like to thank Alexey Sintsov from Digital Security Research Group for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2009-3732 to this issue.

#####

g. Windows-based VMware authd remote denial of service

A vulnerability in vmware-authd could cause a denial of service condition on Windows-based hosts. The denial of service is limited to a crash of authd.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# VMware Player, Server, Workstation: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **201209-25**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation, allowing remote and local attackers to conduct several
attacks, including privilege escalation, remote execution of arbitrary
code, and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-player** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-workstation** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **6.5.5.328052** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

| Package | **app-emulation/vmware-server** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.0.9.156507** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

VMware Player, Server, and Workstation allow emulation of a complete PC
on a PC without the usual performance overhead of most emulators.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VMware Player, Server,
and Workstation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

Local users may be able to gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of
Service, or gain sensitive information.

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code, or a Denial
of Service. Remote attackers also may be able to spoof DNS traffic, read
arbitrary files, or inject arbitrary web script to the VMware Server
Console.

Furthermore, guest OS users may be able to execute arbitrary code on the
host OS, gain escalated privileges on the guest OS, or cause a Denial of
Service (crash the host OS).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Player. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Player:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-player"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
â>=app-emulation/vmware-player-3.1.5â, however these packages are
not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Workstation. We recommend that
users unmerge VMware Workstation:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-workstation"

```

NOTE: Users could upgrade to
â>=app-emulation/vmware-workstation-7.1.5â, however these packages
are not currently stable.

Gentoo discontinued support for VMware Server. We recommend that users
unmerge VMware Server:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-emulation/vmware-server"

```
