Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3062
*   **Vulnerable Software:** PHP Live! Chat v3.3
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `deptid` parameter.
*   **Weakness:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input when processing the `deptid` parameter in the `message_box.php` file, allowing for arbitrary SQL queries to be executed.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can extract sensitive information such as admin usernames and passwords from the `chat_admin` table.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL with a modified `deptid` parameter containing a SQL injection payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server and must have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated.
*   **Exploit Details:** The exploit provided includes a sample URL with a SQL injection payload:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1/[path]/message_box.php?theme=&l=[username]&x=[xxx]&deptid=-999999+union+select+0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,group_concat(login,char(58),password)v3n0m,0,0+from+chat_admin--
    ```
    This payload attempts to use a UNION SELECT statement to retrieve the `login` and `password` fields from the `chat_admin` table.
