{
  "CVE-2009-3103": {
    "description": "The SMBv2 Negotiation vulnerability, caused by the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) implementation not appropriately parsing SMB packets, allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending a specially crafted SMB packet to a computer running the Server service.",
    "root_cause": "Improper parsing of SMB packets within the SMBv2 implementation.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate validation of SMB header fields",
      "Out-of-bounds dereference due to using the 'Process Id High' field as an index without checking table boundaries."
    ],
     "impact": "Remote code execution, potentially leading to complete system compromise. Systems may also experience a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) if the out-of-bounds memory access causes a page fault.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted SMBv2 'Negotiate Protocol Request' packet to a vulnerable server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the target system and knowledge of SMB protocol. No authentication is required."
