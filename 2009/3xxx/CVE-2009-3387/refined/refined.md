Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Bugzilla's `process_bug.cgi` script when moving a bug to a different product. Specifically, the script iterates through valid groups using the original product's context (`$bug->product_obj->groups_valid`) instead of the new product's context. This means that when a bug is moved to a product that does not share all the same groups as the original product, any group restrictions set for the new product that are not present in the original product are ignored, leaving the bug public despite the user's intentions to restrict it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Group Restriction Enforcement:** The core issue is the failure to properly apply group restrictions during bug transfers between products, caused by using the original product's group context instead of the new product's group context.
- **Regression:** The vulnerability is a regression introduced by a previous change (bug 428440), which moved code for setting the new product and related groups to a function named `$bug->set_all()`. This function had issues causing this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** If a user attempts to move a bug and restrict it to a specific group in the new product, and the original product does not have this group, the bug would be made public to all users. This could lead to unintended exposure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **User Action:** The attack vector involves a Bugzilla user with sufficient privileges to move bugs between different products.
- **Product Mismatch:** The vulnerability occurs when a bug is moved between products that have differing sets of available groups.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be a Bugzilla user with the ability to move bugs between products. This is a privilege-based attack.
- The attacker needs to be aware that the target bug should be restricted to group on the new product which is different to the original one.
- No special technical skills are needed beyond regular Bugzilla usage.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was identified in Bugzilla versions 3.3.1 and above.
*   The fix was to back out the changes introduced by bug 428440 and reimplement it correctly later.
*   The bug was classified as a "blocker" severity and "P1" priority, indicating its critical nature and the need for immediate resolution.
