Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3931 (though the blog post does not mention the CVE number it does describe the vulnerability.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of user warnings for certain file types (SVG, MHT, XML) that can execute JavaScript. This allows potentially malicious code to run within the local context of the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of warning:** The browser failed to warn users about the potential danger of opening specific file types that could execute JavaScript.
- **JavaScript execution in local context:** The vulnerability lies in the ability of JavaScript within these file types to execute within the local context, enabling access to local resources.
- **Unsanitized file types:** The browser's handling of SVG, MHT, and XML files did not adequately sanitize or restrict the execution of scripts within them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local resource access:** Malicious JavaScript could access local resources on the victim's machine.
- **Potential for further compromise:** The ability to execute local JavaScript can be leveraged to perform a variety of malicious actions such as information theft, malware installation, or other attacks against the local system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** An attacker could host a webpage that provides a download of a malicious SVG, MHT, or XML file.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker could also send a user a malicious file through other channels, such as email, and trick them into opening it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over website/file delivery:** The attacker must have the ability to control a website or a method to deliver the malicious files.
- **Social Engineering:** An element of social engineering may be necessary to convince users to download and open the malicious files.
