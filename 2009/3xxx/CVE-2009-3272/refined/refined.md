Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-3272:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) issue triggered by excessive recursion when processing JavaScript's `eval()` function.
- Specifically, Safari crashes when it interprets a webpage that calls the `eval()` function with a large string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stack Overflow:**  Calling `eval()` with a long, repeating string ("A/") exhausts the process's stack, leading to a "Stack Overflow" exception.
- **Access Violation:** By increasing the length of the repeating string passed to `eval()`, it's possible to trigger an access violation.
- The vulnerability lies within the WebKit layout engine module "WebKit.dll" used by Safari.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation crashes the Safari browser, rendering it unusable until restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a specially crafted webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to host or inject a malicious webpage that contains the crafted JavaScript code. The attacker has to entice the user to visit the malicious page using social engineering.

**Technical Details:**

- The exploit uses a Perl script to generate an HTML page that contains JavaScript code. The JavaScript code calls `eval()` with a long string of repeating "A/" characters.
- A string length of 21526 repetitions of "A/" (43052 bytes) results in a "Stack Overflow."
- Increasing the string length to 21697 repetitions of "A/" (43394 bytes) results in an access violation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was reported to Apple and was addressed in Safari 4 (4.1.2).
- The provided exploit was released on milw0rm.com on 2009-09-09.
