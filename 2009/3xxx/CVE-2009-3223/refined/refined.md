Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `ppc-add-keywords.php` script of Inout Adserver.
- The `id` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query, leading to the injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before being used in a SQL query, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker could use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords from the `ppc_users` and `ppc_publishers` tables.
- Data Modification/Deletion: While not explicitly mentioned, SQL injection could potentially allow an attacker to modify or delete data within the database.
- Potential for further compromise: Depending on the application's setup, successful SQL injection could potentially lead to further compromise of the server or other connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attacker injects malicious SQL code via the `id` parameter in the URL of the vulnerable `ppc-add-keywords.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- Knowledge of the application and its parameters: The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable script (`ppc-add-keywords.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`id`).
- Advertiser Account: The attacker needs to create a free Advertiser account and be logged in to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit example provided shows how to use `UNION ALL SELECT` to extract data from the `ppc_users` table and the `ppc_publishers` table.
- The content mentions the affected software as "Inout Adserver".
- It also provides a link to the vendor and pricing information for the software.
