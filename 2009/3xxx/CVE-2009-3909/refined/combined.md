# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=600741#c0)  Sven Neumann    2009-11-04 21:57:03 UTC  ``` Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Gimp, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.  The vulnerability is caused due to an integer overflow within the "read_channel_data()" function in plug-ins/file-psd/psd-load.c (confirmed in line 1764. Note that there are further calculations in e.g. line 1803, 1808, and 1813). This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PSD file.  Secunia Research has created a PoC, which is available upon request.  The vulnerability is confirmed in version 2.6.7. Other versions may also be affected.  We have assigned this vulnerability Secunia advisory SA37232 and CVE identifier CVE-2009-1570, which will be shared with the BMP integer overflow reported to Sven Neumann on Monday. If you prefer a separate CVE identifier, we can assign a new one.  A preliminary disclosure date of 25-11-2009 10am CET has been set, where the details will be publicly disclosed. However, we are naturally prepared to push the disclosure date if you need more time to address the vulnerability.  Please acknowledge receiving this e-mail and let us know when you expect to fix the vulnerability.  Additionally, we would like to be able to follow the bug report regarding the BMP integer overflow.  Credits should go to: Stefan Cornelius, Secunia Research ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=600741#c1)  Simon Budig    2009-11-10 00:49:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 147344](attachment.cgi?id=147344 "start of a patch against int overflow issues in the PSD plugin") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=147344&action=edit "start of a patch against int overflow issues in the PSD plugin") [[review]](review?bug=600741&attachment=147344) start of a patch against int overflow issues in the PSD plugin  Ok, this is the start of a patch against int overflow issues in the PSD loader.  This is quite nasty code and I have trouble tracing back the variables. There are two #warnings in the patch that show potential problems not yet addressed. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=600741#c2)  Sven Neumann    2009-11-10 01:41:09 UTC  ``` +#warning what can happen here?                    pixels = g_malloc (layer_size);  Well, the plug-in can exit with an out-of-memory error. Or the OS may decide to grant the plug-in the memory it asks for, which may put quite a bit of load on the system. But I don't think we have a chance to catch this in a reasonable way. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=600741#c3)  Simon Budig    2009-11-10 01:46:23 UTC  ``` Note that the layer_size is a guint32, and gets computed by layer_size = lm_w * lm_h. So there is another potential overflow issue there, later the memory gets written by two nested loops.  The warning really is just a reminder for me to check this issue, I need to trace back where the numbers lm_w and lm_h come from and if they are checked against int overflow already. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=600741#c4)  Martin Nordholts    2009-11-10 07:08:24 UTC  ``` Review of [attachment 147344](attachment.cgi?id=147344 "start of a patch against int overflow issues in the PSD plugin") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=147344&action=edit "start of a patch against int overflow issues in the PSD plugin") [[review]](review?bug=600741&attachment=147344):  Thanks a lot for looking into this Simon.

I don't have lots of PSD to check if they still load properly, it would be useful if someone could do some tests on that. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=600741#c7)  Nils Philippsen    2009-11-16 10:48:48 UTC  ``` I haven't reviewed the whole PSD code, but the last hunk of the patch could potentially overflow the expression type (gint64) if channel->rows, channel->columns and bps aren't guaranteed to be less than certain max values:  + +  /* int overflow check */ +  if (((gint64) channel->rows) * channel->columns * MAX (bps >> 3, 1) > G_MAXINT32) +    { +      g_set_error (error, G_FILE_ERROR, G_FILE_ERROR_FAILED, +                   _("Unsupported or invalid channel size")); +      return -1; +    } +  E.g. if both rows and columns were G_MAXUINT32 (0xFFFFFFFF) and bps were 16, the expression would evaluate to 0x1fffffffc00000002 which is still an order of magnitude greater than G_MAXUINT64, i.e. it would overflow. While the other comparisons in the patch look safe to me (even though they use multiplication), I'd still suggest using divisions as a defensive measure because they cannot overflow (and get by without casts to larger types -- useful if you have to check numbers of the largest type available), e.g. replace the above comparison with:  if (channel->rows > G_MAXINT32 / channel->columns / MAX (bps >> 3, 1))     ... ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=600741#c8)  Nils Philippsen    2009-11-16 11:11:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 147866](attachment.cgi?id=147866 "Use more defensive code for type boundary checks.")

This incorporates the "division" approach for the checks by Nils and also adds a few more sanity checks (it right now barfs on channel data with ->rows or ->columns = 0. if there are PSDs in the wild that have this rather weird property the code is unlikely to do the right thing there).  Note that this patch might refuse to load images when not also using commit  0e440cb6d4d6ee029667363d244aff61b154c33c (already in master and gimp-2-6), which corrects the signedness of the top/bottom/left/right bbox coordinates in the PSD structs. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=600741#c12)  Nils Philippsen    2009-11-17 09:56:34 UTC  ``` Review of [attachment 147944](attachment.cgi?id=147944 "Patch against the int overflow issue in the psd plugin") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=147944&action=edit "Patch against the int overflow issue in the psd plugin") [[review]](review?bug=600741&attachment=147944):  The CVE identifier is CVE-2009-3909 (-1570 is a separate one for the BMP issue).

Several integer overflows, buffer overflows and memory allocation
errors were discovered in the Poppler PDF rendering library, which may
lead to denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if a user
is tricked into opening a malformed PDF document.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.7-3.

An update for the old stable distribution (etch) will be issued soon as
version 0.4.5-5.1etch4.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1181)

## Topic

Updated gimp packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is an image composition and
editing program.

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
were found in the GIMP's Adobe Photoshop (PSD) image file plug-in. An
attacker could create a specially-crafted PSD image file that, when opened,
could cause the PSD plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2009-3909,
CVE-2012-3402)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the GIMP's GIF image format plug-in. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted GIF image file that, when opened, could cause the GIF
plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3481)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)
decompression algorithm implementation used by the GIMP's GIF image format
plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted GIF image file that,
when opened, could cause the GIF plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP.
(CVE-2011-2896)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's KiSS CEL file
format plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted KiSS palette
file that, when opened, could cause the CEL plug-in to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3403)

Red Hat would like to thank Secunia Research for reporting CVE-2009-3909,
and Matthias Weckbecker of the SUSE Security Team for reporting
CVE-2012-3481.

Users of the GIMP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The GIMP must be
restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- viewvc
CVS support got broken by the previous viewvc update for
CVE-2010-0132. This release fixes that again.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- krb5
Authenticated users could crash the kadmind process by referencing
freed memory (CVE-2010-0629).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- pango
This update of pango fixes a memory corruption bug that could
potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code when processing
fonts from untrusted sources (CVE-2010-0421).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3
- gimp
Integer overflows in the BMP and PSD plug-ins potentially allowed attackers to
execute arbitrary code on the victim's system by tricking the victim to open
specially crafted files (CVE-2009-1570, CVE-2009-3909).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- kdebase3, kde4-kdm
A race condition in KDM allowed local attackers to trick KDM into
changing permissions of arbitrary files to be readable by anyone
(CVE-2010-0436).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=537370#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-11-13 11:07:32 UTC  ``` Stefan Cornelius of Secunia Research reported an integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow, present in Gimp's Adobe's Photoshop (PSD) image file plugin. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted PSD image file, which once opened by a local, unsuspecting user would lead to denial of service (GIMP PSD plugin crash).   Upstream patch: --------------- <http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gimp/commit/?h=gimp-2-6&id=88eccea84aa375197cc04a2a0e2e29debb56bfa5>  The another PSD related commit might be needed too though: <http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gimp/commit/?h=gimp-2-6&id=687ec47914ec08d6e460918cb641c196d80140a3>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Stefan Cornelius of Secunia Research for reporting this flaw.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=537370#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-11-13 11:11:39 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the gimp package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, and 5.  This issue did NOT affect the version of the gimp package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  This issue did NOT affect the versions of the gimp package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13 and 14.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=537370#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-11-17 10:26:35 UTC  ``` Public now via:   <http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gimp/commit/?h=gimp-2-6&id=88eccea84aa375197cc04a2a0e2e29debb56bfa5>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=537370#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-17 13:23:10 UTC  ``` gimp-2.6.7-3.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gimp-2.6.7-3.fc11>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=537370#c6)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-17 13:23:20 UTC  ``` gimp-2.6.7-3.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gimp-2.6.7-3.fc12>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=537370#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-11-17 16:14:54 UTC  ``` The Gimp package update is scheduled for Fedora 10 release too, but is currently blocked by the following [bug 518003](show_bug.cgi?id=518003 "CLOSED WONTFIX - WebKit: update to 1.1.1 please").    Once this blocker is solved, The Gimp in Fedora 10 will be updated.

This issue affects gimp packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5. This issue does not affect gimp package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=537370#c16)  Nils Philippsen    2011-06-29 08:20:42 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 374811](attachment.cgi?id=374811&action=diff "gimp-2.2.13-psd-hardening.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=374811&action=edit "gimp-2.2.13-psd-hardening.patch") gimp-2.2.13-psd-hardening.patch  This doesn't fix the problem completely.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=537370#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-08-20 13:44:56 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1181 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1181.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:22:38 UTC  ``` GIF image file format readers in various open source projects are based on the GIF decoder implementation written by David Koblas.  This implementation contains a bug in the LZW decompressor, causing it to in correctly handle compressed streams that contain code words that were not yet added to the decompression table.  LZW decompression has a special case (a KwKwK string) when code word may match the first free entry in the decompression table.  The implementation used in this GIF reading code allows code words not only matching, but also exceeding the first free entry.  This problem is identical to a bug found in BSD compress ([CVE-2011-2895](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2895), [bug #727624](show_bug.cgi?id=727624 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2895 BSD compress LZW decoder buffer overflow")), but given the unclear relationship between BSD compress and GIF decoder code bases, separate CVE is used here.  Several projects refer to pbmplus as the source form where GIF reading code was taken:  <http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/>  In pbmplus version of the code, the flaw can be found in LWZReadByte():          if (code >= max_code) {             *sp++ = firstcode;             code = oldcode;         }  This allows creating a loop in the decompression table, which leads to an "infinite" loop:          while (code >= clear_code) {             *sp++ = table[1][code];             if (code == table[0][code])                 pm_error("circular table entry BIG ERROR");             code = table[0][code];         }  where:    #define MAX_LWZ_BITS        12   static int  table[2][(1<< MAX_LWZ_BITS)];   static int  stack[(1<<(MAX_LWZ_BITS))*2], *sp;   sp = stack;  This results in stack[] buffer overflow.  If table[][] is located above stack[], stack[] overflow may further modify decoding table and break infinite loop.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:25:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516471](attachment.cgi?id=516471 "giftoppm.c") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516471&action=edit "giftoppm.c") giftoppm.c  Local copy of the giftoppm.c, extracted from pbmplus_10dec1991.tar.gz, available from: <http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:26:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516472](attachment.cgi?id=516472 "Test case") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516472&action=edit "Test case") Test case  From [bug #714118](show_bug.cgi?id=714118), already public via <http://cups.org/str.php?L3867>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 10:09:02 UTC  ``` As noted above, this GIF reader code is used in several open source projects.  Many of them have already correct this bug, either by rejecting code > max_code, or by checking for stack[] overflow.  tk - code > max_code check <http://core.tcl.tk/tk/artifact/c0026f5eee240f40fe716e235d28c0818b981ab7>  gd - stack overflow check <http://svn.php.net/viewvc/gd/trunk/libgd/src/gd_gif_in.c?revision=282370&view=markup#l512>  gdk-pixbuf - stack overflow check <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gdk-pixbuf/tree/gdk-pixbuf/io-gif.c?id=f8569bb1#n656>  CUPS was fixed recently (in 1.4.7) and now does code > max_code check <http://cups.org/str.php?L3867> svn diff -c 9840 <http://svn.easysw.com/public/cups/>  GIMP is still affected: <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/tree/plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c?id=8ff66342#n810>  XPCE is still affected: [http://www.swi-prolog.org/git/packages/xpce.git/blob/876ce515:/src/img/gifread.c#l507](http://www.swi-prolog.org/git/packages/xpce.git/blob/876ce515%3A/src/img/gifread.c#l507)  There are several other projects that contain very similar code, but their relationship to David Koblas' code is unclear.  Mentioning them here for the sake of completeness.  They contain stack overflow check.
