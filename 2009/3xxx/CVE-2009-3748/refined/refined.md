- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The provided code snippet shows a Perl script using the MIME::Lite module to send emails. Although it includes a basic "XSS Test File" as the message body, it does not inherently exhibit an XSS vulnerability. The script itself is not vulnerable, but rather the *lack of sanitization/encoding* of input that goes into the message body, which, is not shown in the code snippet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that if the `$message_body` variable contains unescaped HTML, JavaScript, or other active content, then when a recipient renders the email (assuming they're using an email client that renders HTML content), that content would be executed, leading to XSS. The provided code uses a hardcoded string as the body; however, if this value was user controlled the vulnerability would appear.
-  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript, allowing them to perform actions in the context of the victim's email client session (e.g., session hijacking, data theft).
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is email, with a specifically crafted body section.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to inject the malicious payload into the `$message_body` variable that is used in the email.
