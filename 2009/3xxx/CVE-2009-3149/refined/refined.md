    "content": "The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) in elgg version 1.5 and earlier. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability lies in the `/_css/js.php` file where the `js` parameter from the GET request is used to construct a file path without proper sanitization. This path is then used in a `require_once` statement within `/simplecache/view.php` and later in `elgg_view` function, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   Local File Inclusion (LFI)\n*   Lack of input sanitization on the `js` GET parameter.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nAn attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive data such as configuration files, database credentials, or source code. This could lead to further compromise of the system and data breach.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/_css/js.php` script, including a manipulated `js` parameter that specifies the path to the desired local file to be included. The `viewtype` parameter is set to `xD`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable elgg application. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to know the path of the file that needs to be included, and needs `simplecache_enabled` to be set to 0 in the database's datalists table. The default value for this parameter is 1, and as such may need to be adjusted before this vulnerability can be exploited."
