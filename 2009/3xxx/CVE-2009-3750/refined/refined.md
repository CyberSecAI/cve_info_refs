Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ToyLog 0.1 application is vulnerable to SQL injection.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application's `read.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `idm` parameter. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Data disclosure:**  An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords, as demonstrated in the provided example `read.php?idm=1%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%201,username,password,4%20FROM%20user`.
    *   **Remote code execution:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can write a PHP shell to the server using `INTO OUTFILE` and then execute arbitrary commands on the server through this backdoor.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered via crafted HTTP GET requests to `read.php` with a malicious `idm` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server hosting the ToyLog application.
    * The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
* **Additional details**
    * The provided exploit code leverages a `UNION ALL SELECT` SQL injection technique to first find the full path of the webroot.
    * It then exploits the same SQL injection to inject a PHP web shell into the webroot using `INTO OUTFILE`
    * Finally it interacts with the injected web shell to achieve command execution.
