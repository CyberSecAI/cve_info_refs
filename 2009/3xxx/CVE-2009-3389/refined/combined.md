This is a Read AV, exploitability would depend on what we're going to do with the data. If its just jumbled video that's probably OK, if we're reading it into a structure that might later be used as pointers or buffer sizes that isn't (assuming the attacker can control the junk you're copying from).

Summary: crash (segfault) @oggplay\_callback\_theora when playing corrupted ogg theora file → crash (segfault) @ oggplay\_data\_handle\_theora\_frame (memcpy) when playing corrupted ogg theora file

So, this is a variant of the bug fixed in [bug 500311](/show_bug.cgi?id=500311 "VERIFIED FIXED - crash while loading video clip [@ memcpy - oggplay_data_handle_theora_frame]"). The first time we call theora\_decode\_packetin, th\_decode\_packetin returns OC\_DUPFRAME. theora\_decode\_packetin ignores the result and returns 0. oggplay\_callback\_theora then calls theora\_decode\_YUVout, which returns an all-zeros (not sure if this is guaranteed, or if we're just reading uninitialized memory here) yuv\_buffer. oggplay\_data\_handle\_theora\_frame then crashes trying to memcpy with a null source pointer.

|  | |

In [bug 500311](/show_bug.cgi?id=500311 "VERIFIED FIXED - crash while loading video clip [@ memcpy - oggplay_data_handle_theora_frame]"), we crashed because the decoding resumed in a random place in the middle of the stream.
Here, the stream is reset to 0 due to the call to oggplay\_get\_duration in LoadOggHeaders. Then, DecodeFrame calls oggplay\_step\_decoding, which resumes decoding from the first packet. The packet is identified as a header in oggplay\_callback\_theora and passed to theora\_decode\_header which returns OC\_BADPACKET because the decoder has already been initialized.
oggplay\_callback\_theora returns OGGZ\_STOP\_ERR, which eventually causes oggz\_read to return OGGZ\_ERR\_STOP\_ERR. oggplay\_step\_decoding ignores this (as it only checks for r == 0 and r == OGGZ\_ERR\_HOLE\_IN\_DATA), and calls oggz\_read again.
As the first three packets are passed to the decoder again, the first two are rejected by theora\_decode\_header and oggplay\_callback\_theora returns an error as described above. The third is not identified as a header by theora\_packet\_isheader (as it is a 0 byte packet, not the same third packet as the first time through), and is passed to theora\_decode\_packetin (and th\_decode\_packetin which returns OC\_DUPFRAME, which is then swallowed by the caller and 0 is returned).
Stream is theora only, packets are:
-00:00:00.008: serialno 0855307237, granulepos 0|0, packetno 0 \*\*\* bos: 42 bytes
-00:00:00.008: serialno 0855307237, calc. gpos 0|0, packetno 1: 47 bytes
-00:00:00.008: serialno 0855307237, granulepos 0|0, packetno 2: 2.552 kB
-00:00:00.008: serialno 0855307237, calc. gpos 0|0, packetno 4: 0 bytes
Note that packetno 3 is missing.
So:
- should oggplay\_step\_decoding ignore that error?
- where does the 0 byte third packet come from? are we processing packets 0, 1, and then 4 the second time?

cpearce mentioned that this might be fixed by the initialization changes in [bug 512328](/show_bug.cgi?id=512328 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update liboggplay") (update liboggplay), but it still crashes the same way. Curiously, the issue where packetno==2 is not presented to oggplay\_callback\_theora has gone away.
Thinking about it, looking at the stream dump, and ignoring the error handling/packet reprocessing stuff... the first non-header packet that's going to be processed is packetno==4, which is zero bytes, and thus will be treated by Theora as a duplicate frame. Since there's no previous frame data to fall back on, we're going to get either an all-zeroes or uninitialized buffer. The old pre 1.0 Theora API also doesn't report the packet is a duplicate frame:
ret=th\_decode\_packetin(api->decode,\_op,&gp);
if(ret<0)return OC\_BADPACKET;
\_td->granulepos=gp;
return 0;
th\_decode\_packetin returns TH\_DUPFRAME, but instead of the old API wrapper returning OC\_DUPFRAME, it returns 0. So it might be difficult to detect this case correctly.

th\_decode\_packetin reports a duplicate frame when \_op->bytes == 0.
oggplay could perform the same check after calling theora\_decode\_packetin (it's necessary to call this so the internal decoder state is kept up to date). It also needs a flag in the OggPlayTheoraDecode instance to track when the first valid frame is seen, to deal with the case where there is a sequence of 0 byte packets before a valid frame is seen.
I'm not sure if it makes sense to do this and try to play invalid files, or to reject them outright when we detect this case. If we try to play them, the attached file doesn't crash, but also doesn't fire an ended event (probably because there are no valid frames). Also, do we need to be careful to only call the decoder once we see the first valid \*intra\* frame? If so, we may have a similar bug when a stream begins with an inter frame...

Attached patch

[theora 1.0 patch v0](attachment.cgi?id=400683&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=400683&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=504613&attachment=400683)

Discussed this with Timothy Terriberry and Gregory Maxwell in #theora and determined that the Theora decoder should be treating these zero byte packets like other inter frames that are decoded before an intra frame has been seen. In this case, the decoder initializes the frame buffer with solid gray.
Timothy has committed a fix to Theora SVN as revision [r16557](https://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc?view=rev&revision=16557). Attached patch is a trivial backport of that to our in-tree Theora 1.0 source.Assignee: nobody → kinetikStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

I think we don't need libtheora 1.1. It's a large patch, and we're a bit unsure about taking it because of that. We also don't think we need it in order to prevent these "crash with large frame size" bugs, as thanks to [bug 504843](/show_bug.cgi?id=504843 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash (segfault) @ oc_sb_create_plane_mapping when playing corrupted ogg theora file")'s patch, we abort decoder initialization if we encounter excessively large theora frame sizes before initializing the frame decoder. Provided the decode of the header packets is safe (and it seems to be, we don't crash in the test files), we don't need the libtheora 1.1 update.
dveditz: does that satisfy you? We can mark [bug 515882](/show_bug.cgi?id=515882 "RESOLVED FIXED - Unchecked dependencies on frame_height * frame_width not overflowing a 32 bit int") as fixed-1.9.1 as well, since the frame size integers can't be big enough to overflow thanks to [bug 504843](/show_bug.cgi?id=504843 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash (segfault) @ oc_sb_create_plane_mapping when playing corrupted ogg theora file")'s patch.

### Cortado 0.5.1 release

2009 November 5
[«](#cordato-0.5.1)

The [Cortado](/cortado/) java applet is a pure java
implementation of a Theora decoder. Originally developed by the
folks at [Fluendo S.A.](http://fluendo.com/), and
subsequently developed by [Wikimedia](https://wikimedia.org/),
upstream stewardship was recently passed to Xiph.org.

Cortado has been used for many years as a way to support free
media content on the web, and is still an important component
as a fallback for browsers which don't yet support Ogg audio and
video streams natively.

The new maintenance team have now made their second update release of
Cortado. Since the last official Fluendo release, version 0.5.1 adds

* Support for baseline Theora features used by the libtheora 1.1 encoder.* * Better and faster display code.
    * Basic support for Ogg Kate subtitles.
    * Various other bug and robustness fixes.

Please visit the [Cortado homepage](/cortado/) for more
information, including downloads and examples of how to use the
applet.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release. It was a real
community effort.

### Theora 1.1.1 release

2009 October 1
[«](#libtheora-1.1.1)

We've made a follow-up point release to new stable release.
This fixes some issues with the inline assembly used by the
MSVC compiler and various minor build issues. There are no other
significant changes.

* <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.1.1.tar.bz2>
* <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.1.1.tar.gz>
* <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.1.1.zip>

Thanks to everyone who's tested and given us feedback in the last
week!

### Theora 1.1 "Thusnelda" release

2009 September 24
[«](#libtheora-1.1.0)

After over a month of public testing, we're pleased to declare our
1.1 rewrite of libtheora stable. This is the reference implementation
for the Theora video codec. Source code for libtheora 1.1.0 is
available now, and will be incorporated in major Theora-supporting
applications soon.

What's so great about the 1.1 release? The highlights are:

* **Better-looking videos** *or*
* Smaller files at the same quality.
* **Much faster decoder.**
* **Two-pass mode** for making files just the size you
  want them.
* **Rigid bitrate controls** trade off quality for the
  needs of live streaming applications.

This release incorporates all the work we've been doing over the last
year, and the encoder has been completely rewritten, although some of
the code had its genesis way back in 2003. It also brings substantial
performance and robustness improvments to the 1.0 decoder.

* <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.1.0.tar.bz2>
* <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.1.0.tar.gz>
* <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.1.0.zip>

This release is API and ABI compatible with the 1.0 stable release
and can be used as a drop in replacement, although some changes are
needed to take advantage of new encoder features like two-pass. We
recommend upgrading to all our users.

Rate-control has been substantially overhauled from the 1.0 release.
The new rate control module hits its target much more accurately and
obeys strict buffer constraints, including dropping frames if
necessary. The latter is needed to enable live streaming without
disconnecting users or pausing to buffer during sudden motion. Obeying
these constraints can yield substantially worse quality than the 1.0
encoder, whose rate control did not obey any such constraints, and
often landed only in the vague neighborhood of the desired rate
target. The new --soft-target option can relax a few of these
constraints, but the new two-pass rate control mode gives quality
approaching full "constant quality" mode with a predictable output
size. This should be the preferred encoding method when not doing live
streaming. Two-pass may also be used with finite buffer constraints,
for non-live streaming.

Here is a list of some of the technical improvements in the 1.1
encoder.
If you have been following
[Monty's](http://xiphmont.livejournal.com/)
[demo
pages](http://advogato.org/person/rillian/diary/109.html), many of these will be familiar to you.

1. **Rate-distortion optimization,** which leads to

   1. Better mode decision
   2. Better quantization decisions

   Most coding decisions only use an approximation of the full RDO
   process for speed reasons, but casting this in a proper RDO framework
   eliminates vast swaths of heuristics and fragile thresholds from the 1.0
   encoder.
2. **Better motion search**

   The new motion search generates better results in less time, and
   does not suffer from CPU spikes under heavy motion like the 1.0
   encoder's did.
3. **Better fDCT**

   The 1.0 encoder's forward transform was not well-matched to the
   inverse DCT used in the decoder, and was as a result responsible for
   substantial loss of detail and texture at high rates. It has been
   replaced with a forward DCT that gives much smaller round-trip error.
   The inverse DCT in the decoder remains unchanged, for
   compatibility.
4. **Adaptive quantization**

   The bitstream specification has supported changing the quantizer
   on a block-by-block basis since it was first published in 2004, however
   only an unreleased proof-of-concept encoder made use of this facility.
   The 1.1 encoder now uses it to allocate bits more effectively within a
   frame, giving improved quality at higher rates.
5. **Better quantization matrices**

   The new matrices give much less ringing and mosquito noise at low
   rates, substantially improving the appearance of high-contrast edges
   (e.g., text).
6. **A real rate-control module**

   As mentioned above, the new rate control actually meets its
   targets, can enforce hard buffer constraints, and has a two-pass mode to
   allow it to plan allocation decisions in advance.
7. **Expanded rate-control API**

   It is now possible to change the target quality, bitrate, buffer
   delay, and keyframe interval in the while encoding. This gives an
   application using libtheora much more control over the final
   output.
8. **Explicit variable frame rate support in the encoder**

   A new API allows an application to cheaply insert duplicate frames
   to maintain A-V sync during live streaming or for hybrid 24/30 fps
   content. The decoder still operates at a fixed frame rate, but can
   report these duplicates to the application, allowing it to skip
   expensive processing.
9. **Support for 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 video**

   As with adaptive quantization, the specification has always
   supported the less common 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 chroma subsamplings, useful
   for high contrast material like screencasts and special effects
   precursors. The 1.0 decoder supported these subsamplings properly.
   However, the 1.0 encoder couldn't produce streams in these formats.
   They are now supported in the 1.1 encoder.

There are many other improvements in this release. The codebase is
substantially smaller, the examples have all been ported to the 1.x API,
the MSVC assembly is now in sync with the gcc assembly, and much more.
We strongly encourage all our users to upgrade.

This is not the end of the story, however. We are continuing to work
on encoder improvements, and have made significant progress on
optimizing the decoder on ARM and TI C64x DSP processors, important
for Theora playback on mobile devices.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, and especially to
the Mozilla Foundation, the Wikimedia Foundation, Red Hat, Inc. and
private donors who supported this work.

### Third beta release

2009 August 22

Another week, another release.

Like the last one, the new beta release of the encoder rewrite
fixes some problems with the new bitrate management. If you had
trouble with uneven quality with previous 1.1 releases, please
give this one a try; the behaviour is better.

* [libtheora-1.1beta3.tar.bz2](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.1beta3.tar.bz2)
* [libtheora-1.1beta3.zip](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.1beta3.zip)

### Second beta release

2009 August 12

A week after the first beta release of the "Thusnelda" encoder for
the Theora format, Xiph.org has released a second beta.

This version improves bitrate management with some hard-to-encode
files. It also contains build system fixes and a few polishing changes.

### First beta release of the new encoder

2009 August 5

Xiph.Org is pleased to announce the first beta release of our
reference implementation of the free Theora video format, codename
"Thusnelda".

This release incorporates extensive changes to the encoder's rate
control. The encoder is both more configurable and functions better in
all configurations. The new options include support for two-pass
encoding, the ability to change the bitrate and quality targets
dynamically during an encode, and the ability to drop frames to meet
very low bitrate targets, all commonly-requested features.

This release includes all the major features we intend for 1.1
release. Please give it a try. We're particularly interested in
sequences it does poorly on, and feedback from framework and
applications developers on the new two-pass api. For details
of how to use the [two-pass
mode](http://theora.org/doc/libtheora-1.1beta1/theoraenc_8h.html#4a84f982cdd9a3e3c803a29bbde9df0b), please check the code in
the [examples](http://svn.xiph.org/tags/theora/theora-1.1beta1/examples/)
directory.

Many thanks to Red Hat and the Mozilla Foundation, who supported this
work.

### Firefox 3.5 released with native Theora support

2009 June 30

Firefox 3.5 has been
[released](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.5/releasenotes/)
including native Ogg Theora+Vorbis support as part of its implementation
of the HTML5 media elment set. This is a great day for open media
standards on the web, bringing Theora support to millions of new
users.

### Second alpha release of the new encoder

2009 May 26

Xiph.Org is pleased to announce the second alpha release of our next generation encoder for the free Theora video format, codename "Thusnelda". The second release incorporates a number of changes which improve both compression efficiency and execution speed.

### New encoder alpha release

2009 March 27

We're pleased to announce the first alpha release of the new theora
reference encoder, code name "thusnelda".

This new version offers vastly improved quality/bitrate, making
the reference encoder much more competitive with the current generation
of encoders for other video formats. Currently in alpha, this code will
be released at libtheora-1.1 when stable.

If you're comfortable building software, please download the source
and give us some feedback.

### Xiph.Org announces Theora full public release 1.0

2008 November 3

The Xiph.Org Foundation is pleased to announce the 1.0 full public
release of libtheora. More information is in the [full press release here](http://www.xiph.org/press/2008/theora-release-1.0/).

Complete source downloads of the 1.0 release are currently
at <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora>.

### Final 1.0 release imminent; 1.0 release candidate 2 now available

2008 October 28

The Xiph.Org Foundation is pleased to announce the second release
candidate of libtheora 1.0. This second release candidate corrects
all bugs found in final testing of the first release candidate, and
will become 1.0 final in one week if no new 'blockers' are found.

Full source downloads of the second release candidate are currently
at <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora>.

### Mozilla commits support for Theora in Firefox

2008 August 2

The Xiph.Org Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation share the common goal of keeping the Web free and open for everyone, so it did not come as a surprise when Mozilla's [Chris Blizzard announced](//www.0xdeadbeef.com/weblog/?p=492) that the upcoming Firefox 3.1 will support both Ogg Theora and Vorbis, alongside the HTML 5's <video> element.

This announcement paves the way for web developers to break away from proprietary media technologies. For the average user it means posting, hosting and playing video/audio data will become as easy an activity as it currently is for images. For private companies adopting these open standards it means getting rid off the middle man and his licensing fees.

With the <video> element and Theora, exciting development possibilities such as [SVG desktops](//bluishcoder.co.nz/video_svg_demo.ogg) or [annotated media](//annodex.net) will also be possible, creating new ways of interacting with video online. The adoption rate of this online revolution by other browsers soon joining the effort will help start a new age for multimedia. Be part of it.

### Theora 1.0 beta3 released

2008 April 16

This is the third beta release toward our first stable implementation
of the reference library.

* [libtheora-1.0beta3.tar.bz2](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0beta3.tar.bz2)
* [libtheora-1.0beta3.tar.gz](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0beta3.tar.gz)
* [libtheora-1.0beta3.zip](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0beta3.zip)

This release includes new separate encoder and decoder
libraries supporting the new-style API based on theora-exp. Also
included are assembly optimizations for gcc and MSVC builds, better
documentation, general robustness and bug fixes.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release. Please give it a
try and report any remaining issues.

### Theora 1.0 beta2 released

2007 October 12

This is the second beta release toward, following three weeks after
beta 1. This release fixes some bugs and improves the specification
document. We recommend upgrading to all users.

### Theora 1.0 beta1 released

2007 September 22

Moving out of alpha status Theora is now available as version 1.0 beta1. This release features
many changes since alpha7 - for example the beta1 decoder is a complete rewrite supporting the
whole Theora specification.

* [libtheora-1.0beta1.tar.bz2](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0beta1.tar.bz2)

### Website Redesign

2007 September 5

Maik Merten has kindly ported theora.org to match the look and feel
of the [Xiph.org](http://xiph.org/) website. We hope you like
it!

### Theora in SVG

2007 August 21

Chris Double, who has been working on support for the HTML5
<video> tag for Mozilla Firefox, posted an amazing
demo using Theora video as a live image texture in an SVG image.

You can move, rotate, and resize multiple videos playing at once.
Looks really cool. Check out the video
[here](http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/video_svg_demo.ogg).

### Debconf 7 webcasts

2007 June 17

[DebConf(7)](http://debconf7.debconf.org/) is happening
this week, with [live
streams](http://streams.video.debconf.org:8000/) available. Archives will be [posted](http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2007/debconf7/)
overnight.

They have an [impressive
setup](http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf7/videoteam/Setup#Setup) this year, testing several new pieces of software, including
[dvswitch](http://alioth.debian.org/projects/dvswitch/) for
software mixing, [Pentbarf](http://pentabarf.org/)
integration for pulling metadata from the rest conference site, and
CMMLbot for integration of the live irc commentary.

And of course, there are a great number of [interesting
talks](https://penta.debconf.org/~joerg/day_9.en.html)
about the Debian free software distribution, and open source in general. Check
it out.

### Jukola 2007 in Theora

2007 June 11

A large [orienteering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering)
competiton, [Jukola 2007](http://www.jukola2007.net/),
is planning to webcast their event next week in Theora!

It should be a large event, with 10-15k viewers expected. Server-side
support is provided by [Kepit Streaming
Systems](http://www.kepit.fi/). Way to go guys.

A link should be available on the [front page](http://www.jukola2007.net/) when the stream is live
(2007 June 16-17). More information about the webcast is
[available
in Finnish](http://www.jukola2007.net/virkia/jukola.nsf/sp?Open&cid=content445C0C).

### HTML5 video now!

2007 June 7

The folks at [Metavid](http://metavid.org/) are continuing
to prove their worth. Michael Dale has updated his mv\_embed script to
*dynamically rewrite* its host web page to use whatever support
or Ogg video is available from the browser.

That means you can just use, now, the
[HTML5 <video> tag](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-video.html#video)
to embed Theora in your webpage, and simply by including the javascript,
have it work on browsers which do not yet support it.

You can [read about the details](http://metavid.ucsc.edu/blog/2007/06/07/html5-video-the-future-is-now/) on the Metavid [blog](http://metavid.ucsc.edu/blog).

### Theora Cookbook

2007 June 5

There's a [Theora
Cookbook](http://en.flossmanuals.net/theoracookbook) with some helpful HOWTOs up at [FLOSS Manuals](http://flossmanuals.net/).

Thanks to Adam Hyde for making this nice resource available.

### Linux Audio Conference

### Native Theora support in Opera?

2007 March 6

One of the Opera developers [apparently](http://www.flickr.com/photos/56445403%40N00/406571288/)
[demonstrated](http://coolastory.blogspot.com/2007/03/sv-web-builders-event-world-premier-of.html)
[native](http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/03/opera_visits_wi.html) Theora+Vorbis playback in their browser. Very cool! If we can get free
video formats implemented as the baseline for web video, we'll have
taken a major step away from the current morass of competing,
incompatible, proprietary media on the web.

This [follows
up](http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2007-February/009702.html) on a [discussion](http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2007-March/009789.html)
on the What WG mailing list.

### LCA 2007 video online

2007 February 28

Just a heads up that video from all the talks at [LCA 2007](http://lca2007.linux.org.au/) has now been posted,
in Theora format, of course.

A lot of interesting talks here. They're all linked from the
[programme page](http://lca2007.linux.org.au/Programme).

### Metavid theora wrapper

2007 February 3

Michael Dale of the [metavid](http://metavid.ucsc.edu/)
project sent us a pointer to a [standalone](http://metavid.ucsc.edu/wiki_dev/mv_embed.01.tar.gz),
packaged version of their [cortado
embedding](http://metavid.ucsc.edu/wiki/index.php/Mv_embed) scripts.

See the metavid blog [for
more information](http://metavid.ucsc.edu/blog/2007/02/03/ogg-theora-in-your-webpage/). Thanks, Michael!

### ITheora php wrapper for cortado

2007 January 29

Project contributor ZikZak has posted
[ITheora](http://menguy.aymeric.free.fr/theora/),
a GPL php wrapper to skin the
[cortado](http://www.flumotion.net/cortado/)
java player. In addition to
making it pretty, it adds a few nice buttons like play/stop, download,
and so on. Instructions are in French, but the code package contains
everything you need to set it up.

This makes embedding theora in webpages much nicer.

### Creative Commons talk

2007 January 28

[Robert Albrecht](http://romal.de/)
[wrote](http://lists.xiph.org/pipermail/theora/2007-January/001388.html)

### twibright vncrec outputs YUV4MPEG

2005 December 20

Clock has hacked [vncrec](http://www.sodan.org/~penny/vncrec/)
To output the YUV4MPEG format, useful for feeding to the video encoders,
including [ffmpeg2theora](http://v2v.cc/~j/ffmpeg2theora/)
and the libtheora encoder\_example.

A release with the modification is [available here](http://ronja.twibright.com/utils/vncrec/).

Thanks for this, clock!

### Theora on TI DM642 DSP

Posted 2006 December 1

This is actually old news, but in February
[Adrian
Cox](http://www.humboldt.co.uk/2006/02/embedded-theora-video.html) got SD theora decode working in realtime on an TI [DM642](http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tms320dm642.html)
DSP.

Way to go Adrian!

### Theora video on Dell.com

2006 November 10

The Linux section of Dell Computer's [collective
blog](http://www.direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/category/1021.aspx) includes Theora alternatives to their apparently standard
wmv vlog entries. Well done, Dell, for realizing no one can watch
those!

Recent examples include [Logan
McLeod advertising their clusters](http://linux.dell.com/vlogs/Logan_McLeod_vlog.ogg) and [Michael Dell's
Keynote](http://linux.dell.com/vlogs/MSD_ORACLE.vlog_2.ogg) at Oracle OpenWorld.

Now, if they'd just make it the default link...

### Democracy shipping XiphQT

2006 October 8

The MacOS version of the excellent [Democracy](http://www.getdemocracy.com/)
Internet TV platform now ships with and installs to [XiphQT](http://xiph.org/quicktime/) components. This means that if you've installed Democracy, you can play Vorbis and Theora in other Quicktime-based applications!

Way to support open media!

### EATV switches to streaming theora

2006 October 3

[Archive
Entertainment](http://www.editingarchive.com/community/) has switched their
[EATV streaming video](http://www.editingarchive.com/eatv)
feed to [Icecast](http://icecast.org/) and Theora! They
say the switch to open technology has been very successful for them.

Great news. Check out their
[streams](http://www.editingarchive.com/eatv/) or read more

### International Free Software Forum video

2006 September 27

People from [International
Free Software Forum](http://fisl.softwarelivre.org/7.0/www/) (the largest brazilian
event about FLOSS) have done it two times in a row. They've
[put online](http://torrents.softwarelivre.org/)
the whole video coverage for this year's event (also online are the
videos from last year).

It's almost 300 hours in Theora. It's a shame there's no subtitles,
for most of the lectures are not in English...the English ones are really
good, though.

Also [posted

### libtheora 1.0alpha7 release

2006 June 20

There's a new release of the libtheora reference implementation.

This release contains build fixes from the alpha6 release. There are
no new features. The new MMX asm is enabled by default, and a problem
with that same code on SELinux machines has been fixed.

* [libtheora-1.0alpha7.tar.bz2](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0alpha7.tar.bz2)

### Cinelerra supports distributed theora encoding

2006 May 31

[Cinelerra](http://cinelerra.org/) is a well known
nonlinear video editor with support for renderfarms, enabiling use of
distributed cpu power to do faster rendering.

A year after getting import and export support for theora,
Cinelerra now has distributed theora encoding support, which makes
theora content creation much faster.

*Thanks to Andraz Tori for this.*

### libtheora 1.0alpha6 release

2006 May 30

We're pleased to announce a new release of the libtheora reference
implemenation. This is an incremental update over alpha 5, consisting
primarily of bug fixes and a merge of the encoder optimizations from the
theora-mmx branch.

* [libtheora-1.0alpha6.tar.bz2](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0alpha6.tar.bz2)
* [libtheora-1.0alpha6.tar.gz](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0alpha6.tar.gz)
* [libtheora-1.0alpha6.zip](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0alpha6.zip)

**Changes since the 1.0 alpha 5 release:**

* Merge theora-mmx simd acceleration (x86\_32 and x86\_64)
* Major RTP payload specification update
* Minor format specification updates
* Fix some spurious calls to free() instead of \_ogg\_free()
* Fix invalid array indexing in PixelLineSearch()
* Improve robustness against invalid input
* General warning cleanup
* The offset\_y member now means what every application thought it meant
  (offset from the top). This will mean some old files (those with a
  non-centered image created with a buggy encoder) will display
  differently.

Thanks to everyone who contributed!

### Live installfest streams

2006 March 25

The 2006 FLISOL (Festival de Instalacion de Software Libre en
Latin America) is webcasting [live streams](http://giss.hackitectura.net/flisol/) from

### YSTV webcast in Theora

2006 January 13

[York Student Television](http://ystv.york.ac.uk/) is now
available online in Theora, both as a live stream and downloads of
past shows. [Take a look](http://ystv.york.ac.uk/watch/) or
[read](http://ystv.york.ac.uk/streamlaunch/pressrelease.php)
about how they're using open source technology to distribute their
content in open formats.

Way to go, YSTV, this is great to see!

Note that the programs are also generally under a [CC](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0) license
with a wierd additional advance notification requirement. We're not sure
how exactly that's intended to work...

### libtheora 1.0 alpha 5 release

2005 August 20

We're pleased to announce a new release of the libtheora reference
implemenation. This is an incremental update over alpha 4, to draw
a line under recent work before we start adding optimization work.

There are two important bugfixes as well, so we recommend upgrading
to everyone. This release is source and binary compatible with
1.0 alpha 4.

* [libtheora-1.0alpha5.tar.bz2](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0alpha5.tar.bz2)
* [libtheora-1.0alpha5.tar.gz](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0alpha5.tar.gz)
* [libtheora-1.0alpha5.zip](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0alpha5.zip)

Changes since the 1.0 alpha 4 release:

* Fixed bitrate management bugs that caused popping and encode
  errors.
* Fixed a crash problem with the theora\_state internals not
  being intialized properly.
* new theora\_granule\_shift() utility function
* dump\_video example now makes YUV4MPEG files by default, so
  the results can be fed back to encoder\_example and similar
  tools. The old behavior is restored with the '-r' switch.
* ./configure now prints a summary
* simple unit test of the comment api under 'make check'
* misc code cleanup, warning and leak fixes

Thanks to everyone who contributed!

### Cinelerra edits Theora

2005 June 5

The [Cinelerra](http://cinelerra.org) video editor
which has supported encoding to theora for some time, recently got
decode support as well. This means you can edit theora video clips
in Cinelerra!

Thanks to Andraz for adding this new feature.

### Elphel Theora camera in Xcell magazine

2005 April 23

Andrey Filippov has an
[article](http://xilinx.com/publications/xcellonline/xcell_53/xc_video53.htm)
on his FPGA Theora encoder in [Xcell Journal](http://xilinx.com/publications/xcellonline/)
this month. While the earlier [article at LinuxDevices](http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT3888835064.html)
focussed on the software, this one covers in more detail the hardware
and use of the FPGA to achieve the elphel camera's remarkable encoding
speed.

Andrey and other hackers will be demonstrating the cameras at the [Open Source Forum](http://www.opensource-forum.ru/) in Moscow
next weekend.

### Theora decoder ported to C#

2005 April 17

[Ogre](http://www.ogre3d.org/) developer pjcast has a C#
port of the Theora decoder,
based primarily on the [JOrbis](http://www.jcraft.com/jorbis/)
and [Cortado](http://www.flumotion.net/jar/cortado/) java
decoders.

He reports both video and sound are working, and performance is
pretty good. The decoder components should be usable under any of
the C# frameworks, but the example playback application is still
a bit rough and not portable outside MS Windows.

A [development
snapshot](http://www.wreckedgames.com/ogg.zip) is available for those who would like to
try out the code.

### Fedora Conference Video

2005 March 24

Video from the [Fedora
Users & Develper Conference](http://fedoraproject.org/fudcon/) last month in Boston is up in Theora
format. The files [are
available here](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDConVideos), or you can get a complete torrents of the
[Developer](http://torrent.linux.duke.edu/FUDCon-devel-videos.torrent)
and [User](http://torrent.linux.duke.edu/FUDCon-user-videos.torrent)
tracks. Versions with only Vorbis audio are also linked.

It's great to see stuff like this going up.

**Update** as of 20050405, the direct file links no
longer work, but the torrent is still available.

In related news, [Seth
Nickell](http://www.gnome.org/~seth/blog/) has video of the experimental
[Luminocity](http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/luminocity/) OpenGL
compositing engine and window manager in Theora. [Video screenshots!](http://www.gnome.org/~seth/blog/xshots)
Quite cool.

### Elphel FPGA camera encodes Theora

2005 March 23

Andrey Filippov [has an
article](http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT3888835064.html) today on [LinuxDevices](http://www.linuxdevices.com/) describing his open
source hardware theora encoder, embedded in the reconfigurable network
camera he designed, which is also open source. Now this is what
computing should be like!

### JRoar streaming server

2005 March 22

The [JRoar](http://www.jcraft.com/jroar/) streaming server
now supports Theora. Has for a while actually, but then have a
nice set of [test streams](http://jroar.jcraft.com:8800/)
up.

JRoar is a pure Java Ogg streaming server from the folks at [JCraft](http://www.jcraft.com/). I can serve static files,
mirror external streams, or serve a source stream from a number of
clients. It can also serve the
[JOrbis](http://www.jcraft.com/jorbis/) Vorbis player
directly, for a pure-url playback experience.

Thanks to the JRoar team for putting up such a nice demo of theora.

### Cortado 0.1.0 released

2004 December 24

Fluendo announces the [first public release of Cortado](http://www.flumotion.net/src/cortado/cortado-0.1.0.tar.gz), a java-based media player applet.
Since it's a first release, building it might still be rough around the edges,
but should be possible using at least Jikes with GCJ classpath libraries, or the Sun compiler.
You can also download [built .jar files](http://www.flumotion.net/jar/cortado/) of this release.

Visit [Fluendo zoo](http://mirror.fluendo.com/) to have a look at cortado in action.

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year from everyone at Fluendo !

### libtheora 1.0 alpha 4 release

2004 December 15

We're pleased to announce a new release of the libtheora reference
implemenation. This is an incremental update over alpha 3, in support
of [Icecast's](http://icecast.org/) use of some new utility
calls to provide theora streaming support.

* [libtheora-1.0alpha4.tar.bz2](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0alpha4.tar.bz2)
* [libtheora-1.0alpha4.tar.gz](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0alpha4.tar.gz)
* [libtheora-1.0alpha4.zip](http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/theora/libtheora-1.0alpha4.zip)

Changes since the alpha3 release:

* first draft of the Theora I Format Specification
* API documentation generated from theora.h with Doxygen
* fix a double-update bug in the motion analysis
* apply the loop filter before filling motion vector border
  in the reference frame
* new utility functions:
  theora\_packet\_isheader(),
  theora\_packet\_iskeyframe(), and
  theora\_granule\_frame()
* optional support for building without floating point
* optional support for building without encode support
* various build and packaging fixes
* pkg-config support
* SymbianOS build support

We still plan to make incompatible api changes before the first beta
release, but this new alpha provides a stable base including all the
work that has happened up to those changes.

Thanks to everyone who contributed!

### Theora support in LiVES

2004 December 11

Theora is now fully supported in LiVES is a Video Editing System (LiVES), as of version 0.9.1.
If you are interested in having a nice, user friendly interface for
testing out theora, then download LiVES and try it.

 [(http://lives.sourceforge.net)](http://lives.sourceforge.net)

The encoder plugin for theora is written in Python and can be found here:
<http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/lives/lives-plugins/marcos-encoders/theora_encoder.py>

### Fluendo funds RTP streaming of Theora and Vorbis

2004 December 6

Streaming media startup [Fluendo.com](http://www.fluendo.com/)
announced today they will be funding a spec and reference implementation
for encapsulation of Theora video and Vorbis audio over the RTP streaming
protocol, important for multicast, digital broadcast, and conferencing
applications.

A [press
release](http://www.fluendo.com/press/releases/PR-2004-03.html) was issued this morning.

While HTTP streaming of Ogg-encapsulated multimedia has been supported
for most of the history of our free codecs, RTP support is an oft-requested
feature that we've never had a good solution for. We're very happy to
see Fluendo driving this new work.

Phil Kerr will be managing the developement of the new drafts. The
development process is open, with discussion taking place in the new
[xiph-rtp](http://lists.xiph.org/mailman/listinfo/xiph-rtp)
mailing list. Please join if you're interested in these issues.

### Theora encoder, Katiuska 0.6.1, released

2004 November 21

Katiuska is a theora encoder frontend that runs on KDE. It uses ffmpeg2theora, mencoder,
the encoder\_example that comes with the theora libs and a little gpl bash script. It can
encode mostly any kind of video that ffmpeg and mencoder can (avi, mpeg4 and 2, quicktime etc).

On a KDE system, first install libtheora (see navigation links to the left).

Make sure Kommander is installed:

<http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/kommander/kommander-executor-1.1devel2.tar.bz2?download>

Then download Katiuska, and install it by unpacking it, change to the katiuska directory, use "su" to
login as root, and then enter the command "./setup.sh". Katiuska can be downloaded from:

<http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=17831>

### Windows installer for RealPlayer plugins

### Fluendo test stream

2004 September 30

Fluendo has posted a stable test stream for those wanting to try
theora's network aspect. It's mostly just a webcam of their office,
and often rather dull at night (or when the power is out) but it's nice
to have something that's generally available for testing. Thanks,
Fluendo!

The stream url is
<http://mirror.fluendo.com:8800/>,

### aKademy broadcast in theora

2004 August 21

Streaming startup [fluendo.com](http://fluendo.com/) is doing it again.

This time live from the [KDE World summit](http://conference2004.kde.org/) in Ludwigsburg, Germany.

During the conference, the live streams are available from <http://streamingserver.akademy.kde.org/> along with viewer suggestions.

Archives are available at <http://ktown.kde.org/akademy/>

### Guadec broadcast in theora

2004 June 29

Streaming startup [fluendo.com](http://fluendo.com/) has
been demonstrating their encoding and server application at [GUADEC](http://guadec.org/) this year, broadcasting the
presentations **live in theora**. This is a great
demonstration of open media technology. Congratulations to fluendo and a
big thanks to everyone who made this possible!

During the conference, the live streams are available from
<http://stream1.hia.no/> along with
viewer suggestions. Archives are available at the same url if you
missed something.

What a change a year makes. Last year, we were very sad to see [GU4DEC 2003](2003.guadec.org) broadcasting the talks in
the proprietary RealVideo format. Now, not only are the talks in a free
video format, but you can [use
RealPlayer](https://helixcommunity.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7) to watch them!

### Creative Commons videos

2004 June 15

In honor of our slashdotting, we've made torrents available for
[small](/torrents/cc-theora-small.torrent) and
[large](/torrents/cc-theora-large.torrent) versions of
the top three winning promotion videos for the [Creative
Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) licenses, encoded in theora. Free content in a free format.

We also have a feature film, [David Ball's](http://fourthwall.creativecommons.org/)
edgy relationship drama [*Honey*](http://fourthwall.creativecommons.org/honey/).
You can download both [small](/torrents/Honey-small.torrent) and
[large](/torrents/Honey-large.torrent) versions via bittorrent.
These are distributed under an [Attribution-NoDerivs-NonCommercial](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/)
license.

Share and enjoy!

### Theora I bitstream freeze

2004 June 1

Big news. The Theora I bitstream format is now frozen! This means it's safe
to start distributing videos in the theora format.

*Files produced by the alpha 3 reference encoder will be supported by
all future decoders*.

Beta 1 was going to be the official freeze point, but was delayed by
continuing work on the draft specification document; however
we have reviewed enough of the design in writing the spec that we no
longer need to reserve the right to make corrections to
the encoder behavior.

So go ahead, there's no reason to delay adopting a free alternative any more!

### Theora alpha 3 release

2004 March 20

We're pleased to announce the alpha 3 release of the theora reference
implementation.

* <http://theora.org/files/libtheora-1.0alpha3.tar.bz2>
* <http://theora.org/files/libtheora-1.0alpha3.tar.gz>
* <http://theora.org/files/libtheora-1.0alpha3.zip>

The main differences over alpha 2:

* The encoded image has been flipped to match the sense used in VP3,
  with the origin at the lower left. This allows lossless transcoding
  of VP3 content.
* The decoder data tables included in the bitstream header are more
  complete and have more scope for future encoder improvements.
* Some experimental tools are available in the win32 directory,
  including a transcoder for avi vp3 files.

We hope there were be no more incompatible bitstream changes, but as
with previous alpha releases we make no promises that the format will
not change again.

Experimental playback support is now available (separately) for
Helix/Realplayer 10, Xine and mplayer; you might look at those if you
want a more full-featured player. Be sure to use an alpha-3 compatible
version.

### Source now in subversion

2004 March 20

We've switched our version control system to
[subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/)
from cvs, along with all the other Xiph.Org Foundation projects.

Please make a fresh checkout if you're following the
development tree:

> svn checkout http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/theora

as cvs is no longer updated. You can also mount the
dav url directly on your desktop for read-only access.

See our [instruction page](/svn/) for details.
You can find more information about this great new tool at
[definitive reference book's](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/)
website.

### Status update

2004 January 26

There hasn't been much progress of late. Derf has been working on a new encoder, and in doing so
came up with some suggested bitstreams changes to increase the scope for future encoder
improvements. These will be integrated into the reference encoder and released as 'alpha 3' for
testing.

The main hold-up for the beta release is still a draft spec. Everyone's waiting for this because
it means the format will be frozen and encoded files will be supported by future versions of the
reference implementation. So if you want to help things along pull out the code and help with the
documentation, or donate something to help pay for the work.

### Theora alpha 2 release

2003 June 9

The libtheora reference implementation has reached its 'alpha 2' milestone.
A lot of bugs have been fixed and new features added, including all the
planned changes to the bitsteams format.

This is more of an internal milestone than a public release, but we are
making a [source tarball](/files/libtheora-1.0alpha2.tar.gz)
available for convenience. Nevertheless we recommend using the
[svn](/svn/) version if possible. This release also requires svn
libogg and libvorbis to compile; you might try the
[svn nightly tarball](http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/download/vorbis_nightly_svn.tgz)
if you don't already have these checked out. You will need to build and
install the 'ogg' and 'vorbis' modules.

### VP3 Legacy Codec binaries

2003 May 8

Mauricio Piacentini has been maintaining the original VP32 sources upon which theora is
based. He's pooling his efforts with Xiph a bit and has decided to keep his work in xiph.org
svn, in the 'vp32' module where the code was originally released. We hope this will help
concentrate efforts related to theora and bring additional focus to both
projects.

He is also making his binary builds for Quicktime 6 and Video for Windows available on
this site. Please visit the [legacy VP3 page](http://people.xiph.org/~mauricio/)
for file links and complete information.

### Status update

2007 May 7

Things have been slow for some time, so we just wanted to say what's been happening.
Monty's been busy with unrelated contract work since finishing the zero-copy libogg,
and no one has stepped up to act as maintainer in the meantime. We've been working
on a [wiki todo](https://wiki.xiph.org/TheoraTodo) for theora and for
[xiph generally](https://wiki.xiph.org/). So feel free to look (and contribute)
there.

### Test Suite

2003 January 13

We've posted a [test suite](http://www.theora.org/test/test.zip) for your encoding pleasure.
Feel free to post comments and questions to the Theora
[mailing lists.](/discuss/)

### Robot Roll Call

2002 December 16

The first part of Theora Alpha Two, the delicious Video Layer FAQ is now
available on the [FAQ](/faq/)
page, written by Dan Miller. The second part is libogg hacking, the
results of which will be posted just a little after December 27th. Alpha
Two is really more of an informational release than a big downloadable
install-fest, so don't fire up the testbeds just yet.

Welcome to theora.org, the official website for Theora, a video
codec and integration project maintained and supported by the [Xiph.Org Foundation](http://www.xiph.org) for the benefit of
all humankind.

What is Theora? Theora will be a video codec that builds upon On2's VP3
codec. While [Vorbis](http://www.vorbis.com) has reached 1.0,
Theora is currently being integrated into the Ogg multimedia framework,
as well as being optimized from the VP3 codebase at its heart.

Theora will be released in June of 2003, with three major milestones, the
first being released today, September 25th, 2002. Today's piece is
available for download in the 'theora' module of the Xiph.Org Foundation[SVN](/svn/) repository, as well as a UNIX tarball available
[here](http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/download/theora_svn_snapshot.tgz).

There's a lot of useful information under the hood, so please have a
look around by using the navigation links at the top of the page. If
there's anything you think that we need on this page, please
[contact us](/contact/) and let us
know what you'd like to see.

For the legal terms on the usage of the VP3 codec, please check out the
[SVN](/svn/) page. If you would like
to help sponsor the development of Theora and other open technologies from
the Xiph.Org Foundation, please consider a donation! More information is
available at [this link](http://www.xiph.org/donate/).

Thanks for stopping by, and happy hacking!

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- apache2-mod\_php5/php5
Incomplete XML RPC requests could crash the php interpreter (CVE-2010-0397).

- libmozhelper-1\_0-0/mozilla-xulrunner190
The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.1
- libopenssl-devel

- seamonkey
This update brings Mozilla Seamonkey to 1.1.19 fixing various bugs and
security issues.
Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)

## Packages

* [firefox-3.5](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.5) -
* [xulrunner-1.9.1](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9.1) -

## Details

Jesse Ruderman, Josh Soref, Martijn Wargers, Jose Angel, Olli Pettay, and

David James discovered several flaws in the browser and JavaScript engines

of Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a

remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2009-3979](/security/CVE-2009-3979), [CVE-2009-3980](/security/CVE-2009-3980), [CVE-2009-3982](/security/CVE-2009-3982), [CVE-2009-3986](/security/CVE-2009-3986))

Takehiro Takahashi discovered flaws in the NTLM implementation in Firefox.

If an NTLM authenticated user visited a malicious website, a remote

attacker could send requests to other applications, authenticated as the

user. ([CVE-2009-3983](/security/CVE-2009-3983))

Jonathan Morgan discovered that Firefox did not properly display SSL

indicators under certain circumstances. This could be used by an attacker

to spoof an encrypted page, such as in a phishing attack. ([CVE-2009-3984](/security/CVE-2009-3984))

Jordi Chancel discovered that Firefox did not properly display invalid URLs

for a blank page. If a user were tricked into accessing a malicious

website, an attacker could exploit this to spoof the location bar, such as

in a phishing attack. ([CVE-2009-3985](/security/CVE-2009-3985))

David Keeler, Bob Clary, and Dan Kaminsky discovered several flaws in third

party media libraries. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted media

file, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2009-3388](/security/CVE-2009-3388), [CVE-2009-3389](/security/CVE-2009-3389))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- gnome-screensaver
Pressing the "Return" key repeatedly caused an X error that terminated
gnome-screensaver (CVE-2010-0732).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- tomcat5, tomcat6
tomcat was updated to fix several security issues:
- CVE-2009-2693, CVE-2009-2902:
Directory traversal vulnerability allowed remote attackers
to create or overwrite arbitrary files/dirs with a specially crafted
WAR file.
- CVE-2009-2901:
When autoDeploy is enabled the autodeployment process deployed
appBase files that remain from a failed undeploy, which might allow
remote attackers to bypass intended authentication requirements
via HTTP requests.
- CVE-2008-5515:
When using the RequestDispatcher method, it was possible for remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and conduct directory
traversal attacks.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libtheora
An integer overflow was fixed in libtheora. It could be exploited
remotely to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-3389).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- java-1\_6\_0-sun
Sun Java 6 Update 19 was released to fix a large number of security
issues, including several buffer overflows.
(CVE-2010-0082, CVE-2010-0084, CVE-2010-0085, CVE-2010-0087,
CVE-2010-0088, CVE-2010-0089, CVE-2010-0090, CVE-2010-0091,
CVE-2010-0092, CVE-2010-0093, CVE-2010-0094, CVE-2010-0095,
CVE-2010-0837, CVE-2010-0838, CVE-2010-0839, CVE-2010-0840,
CVE-2010-0841, CVE-2010-0842, CVE-2010-0843, CVE-2010-0844,
CVE-2010-0845, CVE-2010-0846, CVE-2010-0847, CVE-2010-0848,
CVE-2010-0849, CVE-2010-0850).
This update also disables unsafe TLS renegotiations (CVE-2009-3555).
Please refer to the following document for more information:
<http://java.sun.com/javase/javaseforbusiness/docs/TLSReadme.html>
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- samba
With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links on the server
side, therefore allowing clients to overwrite arbitrary files
(CVE-2010-0926). This update changes the default setting to have
"wide links" disabled by default. The new default only works if
"wide links" is not set explicitly in smb.conf.
Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker could corrupt
/etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid root. mount.cifs is not
setuid root by default and it's not recommended to change that
(CVE-2010-0547).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-67

## Integer overflow, crash in libtheora video library

Announced
December 15, 2009
Reporter
Dan Kaminsky, David Keeler
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.6
* SeaMonkey 2.0.1
* Thunderbird 3.0.1

### Description

Security researcher **Dan Kaminsky** reported an
integer overflow in the Theora video library. A video's dimensions
were being multiplied together and used in particular memory
allocations. When the video dimensions were sufficiently large, the
multiplication could overflow a 32-bit integer resulting in too small
a memory buffer being allocated for the video. An attacker could use
a specially crafted video to write data past the bounds of this
buffer, causing a crash and potentially running arbitrary code on a
victim's computer.

Mozilla intern **David Keeler** also independently
reported this issue as well as an additional crash which was
determined to be a denial-of-service.

Video capabilities were added to the Mozilla browser engine
in Firefox 3.5, SeaMonkey 2.0, and Thunderbird 3.0; prior releases of these
products were not affected.

These bugs were fixed upstream in Theora version 1.1
("Thusnelda") but the older version used in Firefox 3.5 needed this
patch.

Dan Kaminsky reported some more problems with Theora to security@mozilla.org on Fri, 11 Sep 2009 06:53:21 +0200.
-------------------------------
Almost missed this. There are dependencies \*all over the place\* that
frame\_height \* frame\_width not overflow a 32 bit int -- both in theora
code and yours. Almost missed because height and width are 16 bit
fields in Theora...ahh, but that's 16 bit before a 4 bit left shift.
Close, but no cigar :)

Also, Theora should probably be range checking keyframe\_granule\_shift. The field is bound from 0 to 31, but it's used to shift bits, and various other things inside of Theora. See:
Decode.c#th\_decode\_packetin:
/\*Update granule position.
This must be done before the striped decode callbacks so that the
application knows what to do with the frame data.\*/
\_dec->state.granpos=
(\_dec->state.keyframe\_num<<\_dec->state.info.keyframe\_granule\_shift)+
(\_dec->state.curframe\_num-\_dec->state.keyframe\_num);
\_dec->state.curframe\_num++;
I haven't done the full trace-through to see just what you can do by overflowing granpos, but "what to do with the frame data" does not exactly fill me with joy.

Correct me if I'm wrong but this can't happen due to the check for MAX\_VIDEO\_WIDTH, etc:

Chris--
Yes, that should work against that particular overflow -- though you're lucky Theora stops you from having anything greater than 2\*\*31 in either dimension; you're comparing with ints instead of unsigned ints.
Question is, if \*Firefox\* detects the overflow, will this suppress any overflowed allocs or copies inside of the Theora code. It actually \*might\*, since oc\_info\_unpack is so very distant from oc\_dec\_postprocess\_init. Could be a theora bug w/o affecting Firefox in that scenario.
Still worried about the extraordinary flexibility on granule shift.

The relevant check is in oc\_state\_ref\_bufs\_init(), which is called fairly early on in oc\_state\_init(), and actually ensures that there is enough room to index, not just the luma plane (frame\_width\*frame\_height), but a padded luma plane (frame\_width+32)\*(frame\_height+32), plus two chroma planes (possibly as large as the luma plane, each), in a variable of size size\_t. You cannot get a working decoder if it does not pass this check. Post-processing is not initialized until much later, and only if it's enabled, which AFAIK, for Firefox, it is not.
There \_was\_ a bug in the above mentioned code, because the multiply frame\_width\*frame\_height was done without a cast to (size\_t), so it could overflow if that was different from ogg\_uint32\_t (e.g., only on 64-bit platforms). This was fixed in Thusnelda svn [r15989](https://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc?view=rev&revision=15989), over 4 months ago (note that Thusnelda has since moved to trunk).
Chris is also quite right. If you're now checking against a maximum width and height before creating a decoder, this should solve the problem. libtheora goes through the above to ensure it can still process files with ridiculously large frame sizes in files that are valid according to the spec on machines that have the address space to do so. Firefox does not need to ensure it can do this.
The granule position has type ogg\_int64\_t. It is only used for timing information (e.g., \_when\_ to display a frame). I don't even think liboggplay uses the one generated by libtheora. Theora is a fixed-framerate codec, so many media frameworks (including liboggplay/liboggz) choose to calculate timing information on their own. Either code path could probably be made to overflow even a 64-bit integer, since they're compute relative to the timestamps on the user-supplied Ogg pages. The worst this could do is hand you back frames scheduled to display in the far distant future or the far distant past. It may be worthwhile checking that the latter does not violate any of your assumptions.

Actually, the check you describe (unless you're looking at different code than I am -- possible) is in oc\_state\_init(), and I totally forgot about it. It's this:
if((\_info->frame\_width&0xF)||(\_info->frame\_height&0xF)||
\_info->frame\_width>=0x100000||\_info->frame\_height>=0x100000||
\_info->pic\_x+\_info->pic\_width>\_info->frame\_width||
\_info->pic\_y+\_info->pic\_height>\_info->frame\_height||
\_info->pic\_x>255||
\_info->frame\_height-\_info->pic\_height-\_info->pic\_y>255||
\_info->colorspace<0||\_info->colorspace>=TH\_CS\_NSPACES||
\_info->pixel\_fmt<0||\_info->pixel\_fmt>=TH\_PF\_NFORMATS){
return TH\_EINVAL;
}
0x100000 \* 0x100000 will overflow on 32 bit, and both are <2\*\*20-1 so these are expressible values. This will also bash your luma planes.
Post-proc was an example...you multiply frame\_width\*frame\_height all over (as would be expected).
If we're \*extremely\* confident that Moz's external check prevents you from going down any frame allocation paths, then we should close this bug here. Do you have your own bug-tracking system?

Due to a liboggplay issue (see [bug 504843 comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=504843#c8 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash (segfault) @ oc_sb_create_plane_mapping when playing corrupted ogg theora file")) it's possible for Theora to decode frames before our check is done. This will be fixed in liboggplay according to [bug 504843 comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=504843#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash (segfault) @ oc_sb_create_plane_mapping when playing corrupted ogg theora file").

No, I think we \_are\_ looking at very different code. The check you describe is merely checking that the parameters are spec-compliant (mostly useful for initializing an encoder, which shares that code path). The check I describe was actually added in [r15977](https://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc?view=rev&revision=15977), committed on May 2nd (more recent than I remembered, but still over 4 months ago).

Which is why the check is done early in the initialization.

If you do not create a decoder, libtheora will not allocate any memory for a full frame. As Chris notes, that will require the liboggplay fix in [bug 504843](/show_bug.cgi?id=504843 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash (segfault) @ oc_sb_create_plane_mapping when playing corrupted ogg theora file").
We don't have a real bug tracking system, but we do have Trac: <https://trac.xiph.org/report>
I vaguely recall someone disabling the creation of new logins due to spam, though. Maybe that got fixed later.

Yes, we are looking at different code. I'm looking at:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla1.9.2/source/media/libtheora/lib/dec/state.c#466>
(OK, technically I'm auditing the 1.9.1 branch, but the code is the same.)
You are looking at:
<http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/theora/lib/state.c>
The rather important diff:
/\*Check for overflow.
The same caveats apply as for oc\_state\_frarray\_init().\*/
if(yplane\_sz/yhstride!=yheight||2\*cplane\_sz<cplane\_sz||
ref\_frame\_sz<yplane\_sz||ref\_frame\_data\_sz/\_nrefs!=ref\_frame\_sz){
return TH\_EIMPL;
}
Firefox 3.5.3 just doesn't have that code. It's just not there. Looks like that wouldn't matter, but it also doesn't have the liboggplay code eiher.
Sounds like the real bug is integration delay...

I'm attempting to update liboggplay in [bug 512328](/show_bug.cgi?id=512328 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update liboggplay"). Unfortunately it causes random shutdown failure on our test machines, so it may take a while.

I'm not sure. My only concern is that Theora 1.1.0 has had no exposure to fuzzers yet, so we could be opening ourselves up to a whole lot of new attacks since 1.1.0 is a near complete rewrite as I understand it.

Discussing this in #theora, Gregory Maxwell did about a month of fuzzing (of just libtheora using dump\_video) on eight cores a little while ago, and found no issues.
Given that, and earlier fuzzing of the media library integration during 1.9.1, we've got some coverage. It's possible that there are new problems in the integration that would be discovered by fuzzing, but the chance of that is probably no higher for the Theora update versus any of the other library updates we've taken. It's also possible there are new problems in areas that weren't fuzzed, such as the MSVC assembly optimizations, but I don't think we fuzzed on Windows the first time around either.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
