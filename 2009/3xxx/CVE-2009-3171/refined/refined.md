      "root_cause": "The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Gazelle CMS 1.0 but the root cause of each vulnerability related to the CVE is not explicitly stated. However, the document references a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability that is exploited by uploading malicious PHP code into a template file.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
	"Password Reset"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of the RCE vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. The LFI vulnerability allows the attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. The XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page. The password reset vulnerability can be used to reset user passwords.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "For RCE, the attacker uploads PHP code via the 'settemplate.php' script using a specially crafted request. The file is saved in the /modules directory with a .bak.php extension",
         "LFI: The attacker manipulates the template parameter in the index.php to read arbitrary files",
	  "XSS: The attacker injects malicious javascript using the user parameter in user.php and the lookup parameter in search.php",
        "Password reset: The attacker access renew.php and includes a username as a parameter"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "For RCE: The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server and knowledge of the vulnerable parameters, magic_quote_gpc should be off. For LFI: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter, and the system needs to be susceptible to LFI. For XSS: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with malicious javascript. For Password reset, the attacker needs to know usernames."
