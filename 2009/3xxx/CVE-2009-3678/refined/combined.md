# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

### Irfanview and BSOD

I thought I had posted this before but it's really important to avoid a bluescreen so I'll post it again:
If you are using the Irfanview free image viewer under Win7 64 bits make sure you disable desktop composition on this program to prevent a BSOD!
I just got my first true BSOD in Win7 using this program!
Opening alot images always causes BSoD with cdd.dll in IrfanView's thumbnail view under 64 bit Windows it seems. Very strange considering that it says on their website that Win7 is supported!
[Win7 bluescreen](http://en.irfanview-forum.de/vb/showthread.php?t=4167)

Anyways, this seems to be a known problem as posted on their forums and no fix AFAIK other than disabling composition like I said above or using a different image viewing program.
Hopefully this will help others because we all know how annoying a BSOD can be if you are doing something important and end up losing something important!
Seems to happen to both ATI and Nvidia users on 64 bits. Not sure about 32 bit Win7 since I haven't tried it on there yet. Seems to be a 64bit thing for now though. Also happens on Vista x64.
Here is some more info I found on CDD that is causing the BSOD:
There is one GDI accessible grapchis
display, called CDD (or canonical display driver) that acts mostly as
a frame-buffer based driver with capabilities of supporting Dx mixing.
CDD is a special client of DxgKrnl.
UPDATE: tried it on Win7 32 bits and no crash there so seems to be x64 specific bug.
Also tried it on 2nd AMD rig with ATI card and Win7/Win2008 R2 x64 installed and wasn't able to reproduce crash there.
OOPS spoke too soon. Just had it crash on AMD rig too. Just took a bit longer. Same BSOD with cdd.dll in Win7 and Win2008!

Useful post, I arrived here thru Google just searching cdd.dll BSOD 7. As it happened to you, first BSOD I suffer in Win 7 and was due to Irfanview.

Thanks!

Yeah hopefully this will be fixed in next version of Nvidia driver since I'm starting to think it's a problem with Nvidia driver. Have a quadcore AMD with ATI card running latest drivers and Windows 7/Win2008 R2 x64 installed and tried to reproduce crash there and not able to.

I posted this in the Microsoft Windows 7 forums and they basically blamed it on the program so I doubt Microsoft will be fixing this anytime soon. Note on Windows 2008 R2 server desktop composition is disabled by default so it won't blue screen in a default install.

Looks like it's official now but Microsoft says only 64 bits for some reason although we seen it also works on 32?

## Canonical Display Driver Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3678

An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Canonical Display Driver (cdd.dll) parses information copied from user mode to kernel mode. Although it is possible that the vulnerability could allow code execution, successful code execution is unlikely due to memory randomization. In most scenarios, it is much more likely that an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding and automatically restart. An attacker who can successfully exploit this vulnerability for code execution could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-3678](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3678).

#### Mitigating Factors for Canonical Display Driver Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3678

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* This vulnerability only impacts Windows systems that have the Windows Aero theme installed. By default, Windows Aero is not enabled in Windows Server 2008 R2. Also, Windows Server 2008 R2 does not include Windows Aero-capable graphics drivers. To enable Windows Aero, you must obtain graphics drivers from a third-party vendor or from the graphics adapter manufacturer.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.

#### Workarounds for Canonical Display Driver Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3678

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable the Windows Aero Theme**

Disabling the Windows Aero theme prevents this issue from being exploited on affected systems.

**Using the Interactive Method**

To disable Windows Aero by changing the theme, perform the following steps for each user on a system:

1. Click **Start**, select the Control Panel, and then click on **Appearance and Personalization**.
2. Under the **Personalization** category, click on **Change the Theme**.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the listed themes and select one of the available **Basic and High Contrast Themes.**

**Using Group Policy**

**Note** The Group Policy MMC snap-in can be used to set policy for a machine, for an organizational unit or an entire domain. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

[Group Policy collection](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd)

[What is Group Policy Object Editor?](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a3)

[Core Group Policy tools and settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc9491)

To disable Windows Aero by switching to the default setting through group policy, perform the following steps:

1. Open the Group Policy Management Console and configure the console to work with the appropriate Group Policy object, such as, local machine, OU, or domain GPO.
2. Navigate to the following node:

   User Configuration - Policies - Administrative Templates - Control Panel - Personalization
3. Double-click **Force a specific visual style file or force Windows Classic**.
4. Change the setting to **Enabled** and ensure that the **Path to Visual Style** text box is blank.
5. Click **Apply** and click **OK** to return to the Group Policy Management Console.
6. Refresh the Group Policy on all systems or wait for the next scheduled Group Policy refresh interval for the settings to take effect.

#### FAQ for Canonical Display Driver Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3678

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows Canonical Display Driver does not properly parse information copied from user mode to kernel mode.

**What is the Canonical Display Driver (cdd.dll)?**

The Canonical Display Driver (cdd.dll) is used by desktop composition to blend GDI and DirectX drawing. CDD emulates the interface of a Windows XP display driver for interactions with the Win32k GDI graphics engine.

**What is GDI?**

The Microsoft Windows graphics device interface (GDI) enables applications to use graphics and formatted text on both the video display and the printer. Windows-based applications do not access the graphics hardware directly. Instead, GDI interacts with device drivers on behalf of applications. For more information about GDI, see the MSDN article, [Windows GDI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd145203.aspx).

**What is Windows Aero?**

Windows Aero is the desktop experience available to PCs using a compatible graphics adapter and running the Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate, or Enterprise editions of Windows 7. Windows Aero is an installable option on Windows Server 2008 R2.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In most scenarios, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding and automatically restart.

It is also theoretically possible, but unlikely due to memory randomization, that an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Why is code execution unlikely for this issue?**

An attacker who attempts to exploit this issue for code execution would need to write executable content to a specific space in kernel memory. However, since the starting address will be random, the final pointer destination will be difficult to predict. The implementation of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) by default on affected systems further complicates this prediction. In most scenarios, exploit code could much more likely result in a denial of service than in code execution.

**What is Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)?**

Systems implementing Address Space Layout Randomization relocate normally-predictable function entry points pseudo-randomly in memory. For more information regarding ASLR, see the TechNet Magazine article, [Inside the Windows Vista Kernel: Part 3](https://technet.microsoft.com/magazine/2007.04.vistakernel.aspx?pr=blog).

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user view a specially crafted image file with an affected application. Only applications that use the APIs for GDI for rendering images are affected by this issue.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a specially crafted image file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. Servers could also be at risk if the Aero desktop features are enabled.

**Are third-party applications affected by this issue?**

Some third-party image viewing applications may be affected by this issue if they use the APIs for GDI to render images. To ensure that your system is fully protected from the vulnerability described in this bulletin, you should contact the developer or vendor responsible for support for the third-party application directly.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the Canonical Display Driver parses information copied from user mode to kernel mode.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2009-3678](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3678).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

# How Do You Develop and Test Software?

## Model-Based Design with Simulink® and Stateflow®

![Reactis icon](images/redr.webp)
Reactis plays a number of important roles in
a model-based design process. It gives you a set of tools to test,
verify, and truly understand your model's behavior and can help you check
whether the source code that will ultimately be deployed conforms to the
behavior of your model. More
on [testing
and validation of Simulink models.](/test-simulink-models/)

![Reactis Validator icon](/images/simulink-validation.png)
[Testing Simulink Models with Reactis (14 min video)](/video/reactis-overview/)

Reactis for EML Plugin integrates
seamlessly with Reactis to offer white-box testing of any portions of
your model implemented with Embedded MATLAB®, e.g. MATLAB Function
blocks and the MATLAB action language in Stateflow.

Reactis for C Plugin integrates seamlessly
with Reactis to offer white-box analysis of the C code portions of models
(C Caller blocks, S-Functions and Stateflow custom code). More on
[C Caller block,
S-Function, and custom code debug.](/rfcp.msp)
![S-Function icon](/images/s-function.png)
[Testing C Code in Simulink Models Using the Reactis for C Plugin (8 min video)](/video/reactis-for-c-plugin/)

Reactis and the C
Plugin also support [testing TargetLink® models and C code](/targetlink-testing/).

![Reactis Model Inspector icon](images/reactis-model-inspector-icon-38x38.png)
Reactis Model Inspector offers a low-cost, lightweight
[Simulink viewer](/simulink-viewer.msp).

If you are develping safety-critical automotive software, Reactis can help
with [ISO 26262](/reactis-safety-manual/).

## C Code

![Reactis for C icon](/images/redr4c.webp)
Reactis for C generates comprehensive yet
compact tests from C code, detects runtime errors, and tracks coverage
(Statement, Decision, Condition, MC/DC, MCC). When an error is detected,
you can easily replay a concrete execution sequence leading to the
problem in order to understand, diagnose, and fix the bug. More on
[testing C
code](/find-bugs-in-c-code/).
![C Code icon](/images/c_code.png)
[Finding Bugs in C Code Using Reactis for C (19-minute video)](/video/c-testing-tool/)

![Diagram showing Reactis generating test suite given C code as input](images/tester4c.png)
## Back-to-Back Testing of Code Against Simulink Model

1. Generate tests from Simulink model
2. Run tests on C code
3. Differences are automatically detected, flagged, and recorded in reports.

![Diagram showing back to back testing of C code against model.  Simulink model flows into Reactis Tester which outputs a test suite.  That test suite is subsequently run on C code in Reactis for C.](images/back-to-back-testing-code-vs-model.webp)

### Reactis Helps with Hard Questions

*Will unexpected inputs cause a runtime error?

How much of my code have I really tested?

How do I understand, diagnose, and fix a bug?

Will the brake always deactivate the cruise control?

How do I test my code against the model?*

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
