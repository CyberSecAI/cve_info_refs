{
  "CVE-2009-3678": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The Canonical Display Driver (cdd.dll) does not properly parse information copied from user mode to kernel mode, leading to an integer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow vulnerability in the Canonical Display Driver (cdd.dll)."
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service (system crash and restart) or, in less likely scenarios due to memory randomization, remote code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a user viewing a specially crafted image file with an affected application. This could involve tricking users into visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious image file through other means.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to create a specially crafted image file. For a web-based attack, they would need to host a malicious web page, or compromise a site that accepts user-provided content.  Exploiting this for arbitrary code execution requires additional knowledge of memory layout that would be difficult due to ASLR."
    },
    "affected_software": [
      "Windows 7 for x64-based Systems",
      "Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems"
     ],
    "mitigations": [
        "Disable the Windows Aero theme. This can be done interactively or via group policy."
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability affects Windows systems with the Windows Aero theme enabled. Server Core installations of Windows Server 2008 R2 are not affected. While remote code execution is possible, it is unlikely due to address space layout randomization (ASLR) which makes memory prediction more difficult and makes denial of service a more probable outcome."
