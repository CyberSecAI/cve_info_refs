  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-3665",
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'p' and 's' parameters in `index.php`, which are used to include local files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
        "File Disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to code execution or disclosure of sensitive information. They can also view the content of local files.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By manipulating the 'p' parameter to include local files using directory traversal sequences like `../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`.",
        "By manipulating the 's' parameter to disclose content of local files using directory traversal sequences like `../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`."
     ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application with crafted GET parameters. No authentication is needed. "
