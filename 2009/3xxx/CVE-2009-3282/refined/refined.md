Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-3282:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an integer overflow within the `vmx86` kernel extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `vmx86` kernel extension of VMware Fusion. This is a classic programming error where a variable exceeds its maximum storage capacity, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an unprivileged user on the host system to cause a denial of service of the host. This means the system could become unresponsive or unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local.
*   An unprivileged user on the host system is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the host system where VMware Fusion is installed.
*   The attacker must be able to execute code on the host system as an unprivileged user.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to VMware Fusion versions 2.0.5 and earlier.
*   The issue was reported by Neil Kettle of Convergent Network Solutions.
*   The fix is provided in VMware Fusion 2.0.6.
*   The related CVE-2009-3281 is also related to the same software and described as a kernel code execution vulnerability stemming from a file permission issue.
