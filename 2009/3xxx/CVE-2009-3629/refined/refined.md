Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-3629:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in insufficient input sanitization and insecure handling of user data within the TYPO3 core. This includes:

*   Failure to properly sanitize user inputs in various backend and frontend components.
*   Inadequate sanitization of filenames during file uploads.
*   Insufficient security in the API function `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue`.
*   Insecure authentication and session handling within the Install Tool.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The following specific vulnerabilities are present:

*   **SQL Injection:** Vulnerability in the frontend editing feature due to unsanitized URL parameters.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities exist in the backend, frontend login box, the install tool and the  `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue` API function, due to inadequate sanitization of user input.
*  **Information Disclosure:** A vulnerability in the backend allows a user to recalculate the encryption key.
*   **Frame Hijacking:**  The TYPO3 backend is vulnerable to frame hijacking by manipulating URL parameters.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** By uploading files with malicious filenames, an editor could execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.
*   **Insecure Install Tool Authentication/Session Handling:** The Install Tool is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to insecure password handling, and also to cross-site scripting attacks

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:

*   **Data breaches:** Through SQL injection, attackers could access or manipulate sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Unauthorized access:** XSS and insecure Install Tool authentication could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the backend or Install Tool.
*   **System compromise:** Remote command execution could allow attackers to gain full control of the server.
*   **Information disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information, such as the encryption key.
*   **Defacement or manipulation of web pages:** Through XSS, attackers could inject malicious code that alters the content or behavior of web pages.
*   **Session hijacking:** By exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, attackers could steal user session information.
*   **Privilege escalation:** By leveraging backend vulnerabilities, attackers could escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors vary depending on the specific vulnerability:

*   **Malicious Input via Forms:** Injecting malicious code or data through form fields in backend and frontend.
*   **Manipulating URL parameters:** Exploiting unsanitized parameters in URLs to inject code or bypass security checks in frontend and backend.
*   **File Uploads:** Uploading files with malicious filenames through the backend.
*   **Insecure API usage:** Exploiting the `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue` API function.
*   **Brute-force/Known Hash:** Obtaining the md5 hash of the Install Tool password and using it for access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For many backend vulnerabilities, a valid backend login is required.
*   For frontend editing vulnerabilities, a valid backend login and activated frontend editing are required.
*  Some XSS vulnerabilities (related to API function `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue`) do not need backend access.
*   For remote command execution through file uploads, a valid backend login with file upload permissions (e.g. Editor role) is required.
*   For exploiting the Install Tool, an attacker needs to obtain the md5 hash of the Install Tool password.

In summary, CVE-2009-3629 highlights a collection of significant security vulnerabilities within TYPO3 Core, stemming from inadequate input validation and insecure practices. Successful exploitation could allow for severe compromise of the system and the data it manages.
