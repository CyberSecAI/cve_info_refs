Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-3617:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `aria2` download manager's handling of URIs containing printf format specifiers (e.g., `%d`). Specifically, when logging was enabled, the program would attempt to print the URL using a format string which, if crafted with malicious format specifiers, could lead to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The core weakness is a classic format string vulnerability. The `aria2` application was using the download URL, which could be attacker-controlled, directly as a format string in a logging function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault, causing the `aria2` application to crash. This can result in a denial of service condition, preventing users from downloading files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted URI:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted URI for download that contains printf format string specifiers. This can occur when the user attempts to download the attacker's provided malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide a Malicious URI:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted URI to the `aria2` application, likely through a user interaction. For instance, by tricking a user into downloading a file from the attackerâ€™s URI.
- **Logging Enabled:** The logging function has to be enabled for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects `aria2` versions 1.5.x and 1.6.x. Version 1.3.x is not vulnerable.
- **Fixed Version:**  The issue is resolved in `aria2` version 1.6.2.
- **Patch:** The patch involved removing the vulnerable logging statement in the code.
- **Red Hat:** Red Hat assigned the CVE-2009-3617 identifier to this issue and issued an update for Fedora 12 systems.
- **Upstream Patch:** The upstream patch is available at: `<http://aria2.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/aria2/trunk/src/AbstractCommand.cc?r1=1539&r2=1572>`
