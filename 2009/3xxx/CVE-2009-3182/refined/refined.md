  "CVE-2009-3182": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Gazelle CMS 1.0 file manager allows arbitrary file uploads due to insufficient input validation on the `Type` parameter in the `browser.html` request.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Arbitrary file upload",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP files (e.g. a web shell) on the server, potentially leading to full control of the web application and the server itself.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable file manager, changing the `Type` parameter from `Image` to `File` and uploading a malicious file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the administrative panel of the Gazelle CMS installation to exploit the file manager vulnerability."
