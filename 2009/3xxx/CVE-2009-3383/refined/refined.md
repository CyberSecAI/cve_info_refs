Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3383:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the JavaScript engine of Firefox 3.5. Specifically, the `GetUpvarOnTrace` function was reading from the wrong frame, leading to incorrect upvar access. This is similar to the issue described in bug 507292, which involved incorrect upvar access on traces involving top-level scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Frame Access:** The `GetUpvarOnTrace` function was reading variable values from an incorrect stack frame during trace execution.
- **Memory Corruption:** The incorrect access caused by the bug leads to memory corruption. Although not directly stated, this incorrect access could lead to reading invalid memory locations, possibly leading to a crash or other undefined behavior.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory indicates that the crashes showed "evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances" and presumed that "with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code." This implies that the memory corruption could be leveraged by an attacker to control execution flow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The most immediate impact is a browser crash, as evidenced by the reported bugs.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** It's presumed that with enough effort the memory corruption could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine. This makes the vulnerability critical.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **JavaScript Execution:** The vulnerability is within the JavaScript engine. It can be triggered through the execution of maliciously crafted JavaScript code. This means a website, or another JavaScript enabled application, could be the attack vector.
- **Triggered via Tracing:** The specific function `GetUpvarOnTrace` is involved in tracing execution, so the vulnerability is triggered under circumstances of tracing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Execute JavaScript:** The attacker needs the ability to execute JavaScript code within the vulnerable browser (Firefox 3.5). This could be achieved through a malicious website or other means of delivering malicious javascript code.
- **Sophistication:** The advisory suggests that exploiting the vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution requires "enough effort," implying a certain level of technical skill is needed.

**Additional Technical Details from the Bugzilla Entry:**
- The bug was identified while debugging a related issue, bug 510300.
- A test case was provided to demonstrate the incorrect upvar access, and a proof-of-concept was also provided which demonstrated the issue with JIT enabled.
- The fix involved correcting the frame from which `GetUpvarOnTrace` reads the upvar.
- The issue was also classified as a security sensitive bug.
- A patch was developed and reviewed.

**Summary**
CVE-2009-3383 is a critical vulnerability in the JavaScript engine of Firefox 3.5, where the GetUpvarOnTrace function reads from the wrong frame. This can cause memory corruption that could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. The attack vector is malicious JavaScript code delivered via a web page or application.
