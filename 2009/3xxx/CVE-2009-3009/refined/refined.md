Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-3009:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of input strings within the form helpers of Ruby on Rails. Specifically, it fails to properly handle malformed Unicode strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that the inadequate input sanitization allows injection of arbitrary web script or HTML into web pages. This is a classic XSS vulnerability.
- **Improper Unicode Handling:** The root cause is the failure to properly validate and clean up malformed Unicode characters before they are used to construct HTML elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to inject arbitrary HTML and script can potentially lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of websites
    - Theft of user information
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Form Helpers:** Attackers inject malformed unicode strings through user input that is processed by Ruby on Rails' form helper functions.
- **Non-Persistent vs. Persistent Attacks:** While the vulnerability is most likely exploited in non-persistent XSS attacks where the malicious code is not stored on the server (e.g., via a crafted link), persistent attacks (where the malformed string is stored in the database) are also possible in certain configurations depending on how the database handles unicode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malformed Unicode string through an interface where it will be processed by Rails form helpers. This could be via form inputs, URL parameters, etc.
- **Understanding of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability to craft malformed unicode strings that bypass the escaping mechanism.
- **No need for authentication**: No special permissions are needed beyond the ability to submit input to the web application.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Affected Versions:** This vulnerability affects Ruby on Rails versions 2.x before 2.2.3 and 2.3.x before 2.3.4. Applications running on Ruby 1.9 are not affected by this vulnerability.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was addressed by adding methods to verify and clean up strings before passing them to the escaping logic of the tag helpers. Patches were provided for all affected stable branches.
- **Specific Code Change:** The fix involves adding a `ActiveSupport::Multibyte.clean` call before the `gsub` call in the `escape_once` function within  `actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/tag_helper.rb`
- **Debian Security Advisory:**  Debian issued DSA-1887-1 to address this vulnerability, along with CVE-2009-3086.
