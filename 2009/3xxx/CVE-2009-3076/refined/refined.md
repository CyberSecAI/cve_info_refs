CVE-2009-3076:

Root cause of vulnerability:
The user interface for installing/removing PKCS #11 security modules was not informative enough.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Lack of informative dialogs during PKCS #11 module installation/removal.
- Potential for social engineering attacks.
- The ability to install PKCS#11 modules from remote locations via UNC paths.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker could trick a victim into installing a malicious PKCS #11 module and potentially:
- Compromise the cryptographic integrity of the victim's browser.
- Execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.
- Perform MITM attacks by installing bogus root CA certificates.
- Steal encrypted data by acting as an MITM inside the browser.
- Cause denial of service by deleting security modules.

Attack vectors:
- Exploitation via Javascript in a web page to invoke the pkcs11.addmodule and pkcs11.deletemodule functions.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to entice the user to click on OK in a confusing dialog box.
- The attacker needs the ability to host the malicious PKCS #11 module on a server accessible by the victim.
- The attacker needs to use UNC paths to load the malicious library remotely on Windows.
