Based on the provided content, CVE-2009-3278 relates to a vulnerability discovered in QNAP storage devices. This CVE was created as a result of two minor issues discovered in the initial advisory regarding the primary vulnerability (CVE-2009-3200). While the primary focus of the content is on CVE-2009-3200, it does provide context for why CVE-2009-3278 and CVE-2009-3279 were created.  The document does not detail the specifics of the vulnerabilities for CVE-2009-3278 and CVE-2009-3279.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause described in the document is related to a backdoor key used for hard drive encryption in QNAP devices. This backdoor key is created in addition to the user-supplied passphrase when a hard drive is encrypted, and is stored in flash memory with minor obfuscation. The document states that two minor issues related to the initial advisory led to the creation of CVE-2009-3278 and CVE-2009-3279. It does not specify what those issues were.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary weakness is the existence of the secondary backdoor key for disk encryption, which can be retrieved from the flash memory and used to bypass the encryption.
- A minor weakness is that the key is obfuscated by reversing the first six characters of the key and appending them to the end. This is easily reversible.
- The key is generated using rand(), a pseudo-random number generator which does not provide sufficient randomness for cryptographic keys.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who has physical or network access to the hard disk and flash can use the backdoor key to unlock the encrypted hard disk and access sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs physical or network access to the affected QNAP device to access the flash storage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires physical access or the ability to execute code on the affected QNAP device to retrieve the key from flash memory. Once the key is retrieved, they can unlock the hard disk even if the primary password is not known.
