Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow within the `BrowseAndSaveFile` function of the `ConsoleUtilities` ActiveX control (specifically, `AeXNSConsoleUtilities.dll`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `BrowseAndSaveFile` function does not properly validate the size of input data before writing it to a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the buffer overflow, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack and redirect execution to attacker-controlled code, thus achieving remote code execution.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Even without injecting malicious code, overflowing the buffer can crash the application and potentially the system leading to a denial of service.
  -The provided proof of concept causes a crash if the return address is overwritten with "AAAA", this is a DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user accesses a malicious website that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control. When a user visits a page that tries to access the vulnerable ActiveX control, the control is installed, and its vulnerable function can be called.
- The attacker leverages a specially crafted input to the `BrowseAndSaveFile` function within the ActiveX control, causing the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a webpage that can trigger the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to visit the malicious webpage. This can be done through various means, including phishing or social engineering.
- The target system must have a vulnerable version of the `ConsoleUtilities` ActiveX control installed.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerable ActiveX control is `AeXNSConsoleUtilities.dll`, version `6.0.0.1846`.
- The vulnerability affects the following products:
    - Symantec Altiris Notification Server 6.x
    - Symantec Management Platform 7.0.x
    - Symantec Altiris Deployment Solution 6.9.x
- A patch is available from Symantec, with hotfixes being identified as KB49568 and KB49389.
- The advisory includes information for different versions of Windows, such as XP SP2 and XP SP3. Specifically, the advisory provides different memory addresses for JMP ESP instructions in shell32.dll for different Windows versions.
