Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `changetrack` service did not properly sanitize filenames before passing them to shell commands, specifically `rcs`, `cp`, and `diff`. This allowed for shell command injection via specially crafted filenames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Shell Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is the injection of shell commands through unsanitized filenames. The `changetrack` program uses backticks and `system()` to execute shell commands with filenames as arguments.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The program failed to validate or sanitize filenames, allowing shell metacharacters, control characters, and spaces to be passed directly to the shell.
- **Use of Shell Commands:** The design of the program utilized shell commands for file operations and diff generation, which was inherently vulnerable without proper input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands as root.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By crafting malicious filenames, a local user with write access to a monitored directory could gain root privileges.
- **System Compromise:** Complete compromise of the system is possible with root level command execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Creation:** The primary attack vector involved creating files with malicious filenames in directories monitored by `changetrack`.
- **Local Access:** Attackers require local access to create these files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to create files in directories that are monitored by the `changetrack` service.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability occurs because the `changetrack` script passes filenames directly to shell commands without escaping special characters. For example, a filename like `/etc/test/sth; echo command u like most; cd ..; cd ..; cd ..; cd ..; cd bin; cp bash bash.ultimate; chmod ug+s bash.ultimate` would be interpreted as a series of commands by the shell.
- The program utilizes `rcs`, `cp`, and `diff` shell commands.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by rejecting filenames containing unsafe characters. The fix involved adding a check for characters like `\r\n\f<>`\$\` in filenames before they are used in commands. A more robust fix was also proposed that involved escaping shell meta characters and spaces, but that was later rejected. The final fix was to reject the weird file names.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was initially reported to Debian by Marek Grzybowski, and later confirmed to be exploitable.
- The fix was implemented in `changetrack` versions 4.5-2, 4.3-3+etch1, and 4.3-3+lenny1.
- The vulnerability is referenced as CVE-2009-3233.
