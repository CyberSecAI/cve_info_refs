The provided content discusses multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in various browsers related to redirectors, specifically focusing on the use of `javascript:` and `data:` URIs within `Refresh` and `Location` headers. While the CVE description is a placeholder, the content appears to relate to XSS vulnerabilities, and may be relevant to CVE-2009-3010

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described in the articles:

**General Weakness:**

*   Browsers improperly handle `javascript:` and `data:` URIs within `Refresh` and `Location` headers, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Specific Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Attack #1**: XSS via `javascript:` URI in `Refresh` header.
    *   **Vulnerable Browsers:** Mozilla 1.7.x and earlier, Firefox 3.0.8 and earlier, IE6 and earlier, Opera 9.52 and earlier, and Google Chrome 1.0.154.48 and earlier.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL parameter is used to inject `javascript:alert(document.cookie)` into a script's output, which returns a `Refresh` header with the injected code.
    *   **Impact:** Reflected XSS, allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable site, potentially leading to cookie theft.
*   **Attack #2**: XSS via `data:` URI in `Refresh` header.
    *   **Vulnerable Browsers:** Mozilla 1.7.x and earlier, Firefox 3.0.12 and later, and Google Chrome 1.0.154.48 and later.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Similar to attack #1, but using a `data:` URI to embed the malicious code
    *  **Impact:** Code is executed, but not in context of the vulnerable site. Could be used for phishing attacks and JavaScript code execution. Old Mozilla versions are vulnerable to cookie theft.
*   **Attack #3**: XSS via `data:` URI in `Location` header.
    *   **Vulnerable Browsers:** Firefox 3.0.12 and later, and Opera 9.52 and later.
    *  **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL parameter is used to inject `data:text/html;base64,...` into a script's output, which returns a `Location` header with the injected code.
    *   **Impact:** Code is executed, but not in context of the vulnerable site. Could be used for phishing attacks and JavaScript code execution
*   **Attack #4**: XSS via `javascript:` URI in `Location` header with "302 Object moved" response.
    *   **Vulnerable Browsers:** Mozilla 1.7.x and earlier, and Firefox 3.0.12 and later.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A crafted URL parameter is used to inject `javascript:alert(document.cookie)` into a script's output, which returns a `Location` header with a "302 Object Moved" response. The code executes when the user clicks the link on the "Object Moved" page.
    *  **Impact:** Social XSS attack, requires user interaction (clicking a link), but allows arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the site's context.
*   **Attack #5**: XSS via `javascript:` URI in `Location` header (any 301/302 response).
    *   **Vulnerable Browsers:** Maxthon 3 Alpha (3.0.0.145) with Ultramode
    *   **Attack Vector:** Similar to #4, but works with any 301 or 302 response and executes code when the "Refresh the page" link is clicked, and code executes outside the context of the site.
    *   **Impact:** Social XSS attack that executes arbitrary JavaScript code.
*  **Attack #6:** XSS via `javascript:` URI in `Location` header with "302 Found" response.
    *   **Vulnerable Browsers:** Mozilla 1.7.x and earlier, Mozilla Firefox 3.0.19 and later,
    *    **Attack Vector:** Similar to #4, but with a 302 Found response. Code executes after the user clicks the link on the "Found" page.
    *   **Impact:** Social XSS attack that executes arbitrary JavaScript code within the site's context.
*   **Attacks #7 & 8**: XSS via `data:` and `javascript:` URI in redirectors using 301 and 303 status codes

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:** In older browsers or certain configurations, attackers can steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate users.
*   **JavaScript Execution:** Arbitrary JavaScript code can be executed, leading to a variety of attacks:
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Redirect users to fake login pages or other malicious content.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirect users to sites that install malware on their machines.
    *   **Defacement:** Alter the appearance of a legitimate website.
* **Social XSS:**  In some scenarios, user interaction (such as clicking a link) is required, making it a social engineering attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS:**  Crafted URLs with malicious payloads are sent to vulnerable web applications that reflect the payload in `Refresh` or `Location` headers.
*   **Redirectors:**  Attackers exploit vulnerable redirect scripts that do not properly sanitize or validate URL parameters before using them in headers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send crafted URLs:**  Attackers need to send users malicious URLs, often through social engineering tactics like email, chat messages, or posting links on forums.
*   **Vulnerable web application:**  A web application that uses redirectors improperly.
