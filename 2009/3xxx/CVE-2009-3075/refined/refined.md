Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-3075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from crashes occurring in the JavaScript engine of Mozilla products, specifically within the function `JS_GetFunctionScript`. These crashes are linked to a memory corruption issue. The specific scenario involves how `nsJSContext::CallEventHandler` handles `XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper` when used with `setTimeout`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that under certain conditions, the JavaScript engine is susceptible to memory corruption. This occurs when `setTimeout` is used with an `XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper`, leading to a crash and a potential security vulnerability.
2.  **Improper Type Handling:**  `nsJSContext::CallEventHandler` does not properly handle `XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper`, where `setTimeout` treats `XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper` wrapping a function as a function, resulting in a call where `JSFunction` is a `XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper`, not a `JSFunction` object, and then crashes.
3.  **Pointer Handling:** Incorrect pointer handling within the JavaScript engine causes a crash while attempting to get the script, since `JS_GetFunctionScript` assumes a `JSFunction` argument when it receives an `XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper` (which is not a `JSFunction` object).
4.  **Integer Overflow**:  In `nsBinHexDecoder` a buffer overflow in `mName`, a fixed-length char array was discovered

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This is due to the memory corruption, where overwriting memory can potentially redirect execution flow.
*  **Denial of Service**:  By sending malformed input, attackers can cause a denial of service. 

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious JavaScript:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting malicious JavaScript code. This code could then trigger the vulnerable sections of the JavaScript engine. This can be via malicious websites or browser extensions (Greasemonkey).
*   **Crafted File Names:** An attacker could create a malicious file with a crafted filename that, when processed by Thunderbird, leads to a vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Malicious JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript into a page visited by the victim or be able to convince the user to load a crafted file. This could happen through various methods such as:
    *   Compromised websites.
    *   Malicious advertisements.
    *   Browser extensions with vulnerabilities.
    *   Specially crafted emails or files.
*   **User Interaction**: In the Thunderbird case, the user would need to be tricked into viewing malicious content.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Firefox 3.0.14 and Firefox 3.5.3, as well as in SeaMonkey 1.1.19 and Thunderbird 2.0.0.24, by correcting how the Javascript engine handles wrapped functions and adding a check for that case.
*  The bug was a regression introduced by the fix for another bug ([bug 425139](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=425139)), and was fixed with a "spot fix" in [bug 505305](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505305) and [bug 441714](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=441714).
*  A patch exists for the 1.8 branch for the `nsBinHexDecoder` buffer overflow, which is also fixed as part of this CVE in Thunderbird 2.0.0.24.
* The Debian Security Advisory DSA-1885-1 also addresses CVE-2009-3075 in xulrunner packages.
*   The Secunia Research team has investigated and provided data on this vulnerability.
