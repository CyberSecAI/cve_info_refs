Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3892:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an escaping bug in the display of Custom Field values within the Request Tracker (RT) software. Specifically, the `ShowCustomFields` element did not properly sanitize user-supplied data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper escaping of custom field values allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code into the RT user interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Performing actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the RT web interface.
    - Accessing sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of custom field values. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a custom field through either:
    - The RT web interface (if SelfService or similar features are enabled).
    - An automated parsing script (e.g., RT-Extension-ExtractCustomFieldValues, RT-Extension-CommandByMail).
    - Through a local modification parsing process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set custom field values, either through:
    - Having the ability to use RT's SelfService interface or similar web-based user input mechanisms to modify custom fields.
    - Utilizing an automated parsing script or a local parsing modification to feed data into custom fields.
- In addition, the attacker would be in a position to exploit any user browsing the RT page that renders the malicious custom field value.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects RT versions 3.4.6 to 3.8.4.
- The issue does *not* affect custom fields that use "select one value" fields.
- The provided patches for different RT branches replace `$m->print( $value->Content )` with `$m->out( $m->interp->apply_escapes( $value->Content, 'h' ) )`, thereby properly escaping the content for HTML display.
