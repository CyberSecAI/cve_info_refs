  "CVE-2009-3111": {
    "description": "FreeRADIUS 1.1.8 and earlier is vulnerable to a remote denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to improper handling of zero-length Tunnel-Password attributes in the rad_decode() function, which can cause the radiusd daemon to crash.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly handle zero-length Tunnel-Password attributes within the `rad_decode()` function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Remote Denial of Service"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted RADIUS packet with a zero-length Tunnel-Password attribute, leading to the termination of the radiusd daemon.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the RADIUS protocol.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send RADIUS packets to a vulnerable FreeRADIUS server. No authentication is explicitly required for the exploit to be successful."

    "affected_versions": [
      "freeradius-1.1.3 up to freeradius-1.1.7",
