Subject: backuppc: Security hole when using rsync and multiple users
Date: Tue, 18 Aug 2009 15:03:09 +0100
```
Package: backuppc
Version: 3.1.0-4
Severity: critical
Tags: security
Justification: root security hole

When using an SSH key and Rsync with BackupPC on a system with multiple users, Users (as opposed to admins) have the ability to change the ClientNameAlias on machines they are listed as owning.
As BackupPC user has one ssh key, which can be in the authorized keys of many machines (often as root), this allows a user to backup from and restore to any machines that key gives access to, by changing the ClientNameAlias to the target machine and initiating a backup.

I've just tested this, and as an unpriviledged user was able to change backing up /scratch on my desktop to /etc on a server and then read /etc/shadow from the server.
Whilst I haven't tested this, I see no reason I couldn't restore to the server as well, thus changing arbitrary files as root (and gaining root access).

Following up on this:

Having played around a little further, there is the option
CgiUserConfigEdit which specifies which options a user is permitted to
modify.
I think that this list needs trimming down in the default installs, and
certainly having ClientNameAlias removing from it.

By removing ClientNameAlias from the list specified in
CgiUserConfigEdit, users cannot change hostnames, thus closing this hole.

Regards,

David Ambrose-Griffith

The patch included in 3.1.0-7 doesn't actually fix the problem. Normal
users can still set the ClientNameAlias by adding something like
"&override_ClientNameAlias=1&v_zZ_ClientNameAlias=xxxx" to their POST.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=518412#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-08-20 09:54:57 UTC  ``` David Ambrose-Griffith from Durham University reported permission bypass flaw in the way BackupPC server used to verify BackupPC client privileges to perform PC backup / restore, when using rsync data backup method. BackupPC client with certain configuration could use this flaw to retrieve security sensitive data (by backup) or, potentially to overwrite arbitrary system of backuped host (by restore), leading to privilege escalation.  References: ----------- <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=542218>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=518412#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-09-25 08:27:24 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2009-3369](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3369) to the following vulnerability:  CgiUserConfigEdit in BackupPC 3.1.0, when SSH keys and Rsync are in use in a multi-user environment, does not restrict users from the ClientNameAlias function, which allows remote authenticated users to read and write sensitive files by modifying ClientNameAlias to match another system, then initiating a backup or restore.  References: ----------- <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3369> <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=542218> <http://secunia.com/advisories/36393> <http://osvdb.org/57236>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=518412#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-09-25 08:31:52 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of BackupPC package, as shipped  with Fedora releases of 10 and 11 and within EPEL-5 project.  Please fix.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=518412#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-09-25 15:29:07 UTC  ``` BackupPC-3.1.0-7.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/BackupPC-3.1.0-7.fc11>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=518412#c6)  Fedora Update System    2009-09-25 15:29:13 UTC  ``` BackupPC-3.1.0-6.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/BackupPC-3.1.0-6.fc10>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=518412#c7)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-27 06:56:10 UTC  ``` BackupPC-3.1.0-7.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=518412#c8)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-27 07:01:01 UTC  ``` BackupPC-3.1.0-6.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.
