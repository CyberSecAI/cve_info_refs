The provided content is related to CVE-2009-3371.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way `XPC_WN_CallMethod` handles the initialization of `XPCCallContext`. Specifically, the `mSet` member was not initialized if a garbage collection occurred between the construction of `XPCCallContext` and the call to `SetCallInfo`. This could lead to a crash when attempting to mark a garbage set.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper initialization of `mSet` in the `XPCCallContext` object, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A crash in the browser, potentially exploitable to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.

**Attack vectors:**
- Recursive creation of JavaScript web-workers to trigger garbage collection at a specific point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute JavaScript code within a web page.
