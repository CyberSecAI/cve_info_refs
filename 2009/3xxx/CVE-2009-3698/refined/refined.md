- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the Android Dalvik API that allows for a system process restart.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A specific malicious application can trigger a vulnerable API function which restarts the system process. This can also occur unintentionally by developers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The system process restart results in a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious application needs to be downloaded and executed by the user to trigger the vulnerable API function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious application and convince a user to download and execute it.
