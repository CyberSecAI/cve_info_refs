{
  "CVE-2009-3983": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Firefox NT Lan Manager (NTLM) authentication protocol implementation. If an attacker could trick a local user that has NTLM credentials into visiting a specially-crafted web page, they could send arbitrary requests, authenticated with the user's NTLM credentials, to other applications on the user's system.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox handles NTLM authentication. When a user with NTLM credentials is tricked into visiting a malicious webpage, the browser's flawed implementation allows the attacker to forward the user's credentials to other applications on the system.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of NTLM authentication",
      "NTLM reflection vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could send arbitrary requests to other applications on the user's system, authenticated with the user's NTLM credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access or actions within those applications.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "A malicious website visited by a user with NTLM credentials"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a local user with NTLM credentials into visiting a specially crafted webpage. The attacker also needs to be able to control the malicious website to initiate the malicious requests."
