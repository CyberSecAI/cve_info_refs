1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- php5
php5 has been updated to fix problems with SSL certificate
validation and overflows in the exif and gd modules
(CVE-2009-3291,CVE-2009-3292, CVE-2009-3293, CVE-2009-2687).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- newt
A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way newt used to process
content, to be rendered in text dialog box. Local attacker could issue
a specially-crafted text dialog box rendering request (direct or via
custom application), leading to denial of service (application crash)
or, potentially, to execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running the application (CVE-2009-2905).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- rubygem-actionpack
This update improves the escaping in the helper code of Ruby on
Rails to protect against XSS attacks (CVE-2009-3009) and an
information leak (CVE-2009-3086).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.1
- rubygem-activesupport
This update improves the escaping in the helper code of Ruby on
Rails to protect against XSS attacks (CVE-2009-3009) and an
information leak (CVE-2009-3086).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.1
- java-1\_4\_2-ibm
IBM Java 1.4.2 was updated to SR13 FP1.
It fixes following two security issues:
CVE-2009-2625: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with parsing XML data might allow a remote client to create a
denial-of-service condition on the system that the JRE runs on.
CVE-2008-5349: A vulnerability in how the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) handles certain RSA public keys might cause the JRE to consume
an excessive amount of CPU resources. This might lead to a Denial of
Service (DoS) condition on affected systems. Such keys could be
provided by a remote client of an application.
This issue affects the following security providers:
IBMJCE, IBMPKCS11Impl and IBMJCEFIPS.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11
- postgresql
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in PostgrSQL
- CVE-2009-3229: allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial
of service
- CVE-2009-3230: allows remote authenticated users to gain higher
privileges
- CVE-2009-3231: when using LDAP authentication with anonymous
binds, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an
empty password
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- samba
samba's make\_connection\_snum() handles certain input incorrectly,
which may lead to disclosure of the root directory (CVE-2009-2813).
Additionally an information disclosure vulnerability in mount.cifs
has been fixed (CVE-2009-2948) as well as a DoS condition
(CVE-2009-2906).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- phpMyAdmin
phpMyAdmin has been updated to version 2.11.9.6 to fix a cross-site
scripting (XSS) issue (CVE-2009-3696) and an SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2009-3697).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3, openSUSE 11.0
- viewvc
Update of viewvc to version 1.0.9 fixes a cross-site scripting (XSS)
problem and enhances filtering of illegal characters when displaying
error messages (CVE-2009-3618, CVE-2009-3619).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
