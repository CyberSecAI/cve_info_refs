Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper handling of user-supplied input in ViewVC, specifically in how it processed the 'view' parameter and illegal characters in parameter names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows for XSS attacks due to insufficient validation of the 'view' parameter.
2.  **Improper Handling of Illegal Characters:** The software was not properly filtering or sanitizing illegal characters within parameter names, leading to potential issues when they were printed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **XSS:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.
2.  **Improper Output:** Displaying illegal characters might cause unexpected behavior, application malfunction, or provide a channel for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors involve crafting malicious URLs containing specially crafted 'view' parameter values or parameter names with illegal characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the malicious input, which they could then trick a user into accessing. This could be achieved through phishing emails, links on other websites, or other methods of getting the URL to the victim.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in ViewVC version 1.1.2.
*   The fix involved validating the 'view' parameter and avoiding the printing of illegal parameter names and values.
*  CVE-2009-3619 is related and addresses the issue of printing illegal parameter names, while CVE-2009-3618 specifically targets the XSS via the 'view' parameter.
