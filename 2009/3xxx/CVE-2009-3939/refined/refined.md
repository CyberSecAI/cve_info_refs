Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2009-3939 from the provided documents:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `dbg_lvl` and `poll_mode_io` files within the megaraid\_sas driver's sysfs interface had world-writable permissions. This means any local user, including unprivileged ones, could modify these files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is the incorrect file permissions on the `dbg_lvl` and `poll_mode_io` files within the megaraid\_sas driver's sysfs interface. These files were world-writable, allowing any local user to modify them, which is a violation of the principle of least privilege.
*   **Driver Configuration Exposure**: Because the files controlled driver settings, any user could potentially alter the behavior or logging level of the megaraid\_sas driver.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By modifying the `dbg_lvl` and/or `poll_mode_io` files, a local attacker could cause a denial of service on the affected system, either by crashing the system or by disrupting the driver's operations.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, specifically for CVE-2009-3080, it's mentioned that the array index error in the gdth driver could *possibly* lead to privilege escalation, in addition to a denial of service. While CVE-2009-3939 itself may not directly lead to privilege escalation, this associated CVE highlights the potential for driver manipulation to lead to such an outcome. It should be noted however that, the primary method of exploit is the denial of service attack on the driver.
*   **Unspecified Impact:** Some of the descriptions of associated vulnerabilities, notably CVE-2009-4005 and CVE-2009-4020, refer to a potential for "unspecified impact" that could possibly include privilege escalation or other attacks depending on the exploit specifics. The primary risk however, is denial of service.
*   **Change driver behavior:** A local attacker could change the behavior of the driver. This includes changing the logging level of the driver.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability. This could include console access, remote shell access through a vulnerability, or direct access as a regular unprivileged user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker requires filesystem access permissions to write to `/sys` and the subdirectories in order to modify the permissions.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to a permission issue with the `megaraid_sas` driver.
*   Red Hat and other distributions issued security advisories to address this and other vulnerabilities with kernel updates. The fix involves restricting the write permissions of the vulnerable sysfs files.
*   The vulnerability affects various Linux distributions including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, openSUSE and possibly others using the vulnerable driver.
*   The RHSA-2010:0046 security advisory from Red Hat explicitly mentions that the world-writable permissions for the `dbg_lvl` and `poll_mode_io` sysfs files in the megaraid\_sas driver (CVE-2009-3889 and CVE-2009-3939 respectively) were a problem.
*   The fix for CVE-2009-3939 was backported and included in Linux kernel updates.
*   The resolution of this vulnerability is typically done via a kernel update.

**Summary:**

CVE-2009-3939 identifies a vulnerability in the megaraid\_sas driver where incorrect file permissions could be exploited by a local user to modify the driver's behavior, potentially leading to denial of service or other unpredictable outcomes. The core issue lies in the overly permissive write access to the driver's control files via the sysfs interface, and the remediation involves restricting these permissions. This is often addressed in combination with related CVEs, as was the case in RHSA-2010:0046.
