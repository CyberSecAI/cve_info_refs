Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3736:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content from `support.avaya.com`, `security.gentoo.org` and `rhn.redhat.com` directly mentions CVE-2009-3736 and its description which aligns with the vulnerability. Other sources, like mailing lists and git commit logs, confirm the vulnerability in libtool's libltdl. Therefore, the content is relevant.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from how GNU Libtool's `libltdl` library searches for libraries to load. Specifically, when using the `lt_dlopen` and `lt_dlopenext` functions and opening a module using a non-absolute path or if an old_library field in a .la file contains a non-absolute filename, the library may load a malicious module from the current working directory or other insecure directories included in the shared library search path.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Insecure Search Path:** The primary weakness is the library's tendency to check the current working directory for modules (.la files) even when it should only use the paths provided or those specified in .la files. This behavior bypasses the standard security policies related to library search paths.
   - **Lack of Input Validation:** When handling `old_library` entries in `.la` files, the library doesn't properly validate the provided paths (or lack thereof), allowing relative or unqualified paths to be used during the library loading process.
   - **Dependency on `.la` Files:** The vulnerability is triggered when dynamic linking is used alongside the presence of .la files, and specifically, the old_library field is non-empty which results in a call to dlopen with an unqualified library name.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running a vulnerable Java or other application.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** In some cases, particularly with a high number of hash collisions or using an uninitialized pointer,  the vulnerability can lead to a deadlock or crash of the application.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Local Attack:** The attack vector involves tricking a user into running a vulnerable application (typically a Java application using `System.loadLibrary`) from an attacker-controlled directory.
   - **Malicious Shared Object:** The attacker places a malicious library (e.g., a shared object with the same name as the expected library) in the current directory of the vulnerable application.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to create malicious files in a directory that a user may execute from. 
   - **User Interaction:** The attacker must trick the user to run an application from within the malicious directory.
   - **Understanding Vulnerable Application:** The attacker must know that the targeted application utilizes `libltdl` and makes use of module loading functions using a non-absolute path.
   - **Knowledge of old_library:** The attacker needs to know the library that the target application will attempt to load based on its .la files to create a matching malicious module.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Operating System Specifics**: While the vulnerability exists on many platforms, the risk is higher on Windows, OS X, HP-UX, and True 64 UNIX, as they typically search the current working directory by default.
- **Mitigation**: Updating libtool to versions that include the fix addresses the issue, and RedHat has released updates to address this issue in their products (RHSA-2010:0039)
- **Affected applications**: Any application using libltdl, and particularly the `lt_dlopen` and `lt_dlopenext` functions, and has the old_library variable populated in .la files may be vulnerable if the application's execution context results in the current directory being searched by the module loader.

In summary, CVE-2009-3736 is a library loading vulnerability in `libltdl` that can lead to arbitrary code execution or DoS if exploited. Attackers require local access and the ability to trick users into running a vulnerable application from a directory controlled by the attacker.
