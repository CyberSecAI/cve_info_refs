Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3064:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an insecure `require` statement within the `debug_php.php` file of Ve-EDIT v 0.1.4.
- The code directly includes a file specified by user-controlled input from the `filename` GET parameter without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application is vulnerable to local file inclusion due to the ability to control the included file path via the `filename` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's file system. This can be leveraged to:
    - Read sensitive files, potentially including configuration files, databases, or source code.
    - If the server allows remote access to included files (e.g. through log files or session files) attackers may be able to achieve Remote Code Execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `debug_php.php`, manipulating the `filename` parameter.
  - Example: `http://localhost/[PATH]/debugger/debug_php.php?_GET[filename]=/etc/passwd`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable application's path and the `debug_php.php` file.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit information includes the vulnerable line of code: `require("./../".$_GET["filename"]);`. This highlights that the application is vulnerable due to using a user supplied value in the filename parameter and includes files relative to the directory of the vulnerable script.
