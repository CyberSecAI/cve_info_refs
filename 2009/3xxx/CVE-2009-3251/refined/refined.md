Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3251:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how vtiger CRM handles field visibility permissions when creating custom views for the Calendar module. Specifically, even if a user profile has certain fields (like visibility, location, recurrence) disabled for the Calendar module, these fields would still appear and be accessible when creating custom views. This effectively bypasses the intended access restrictions.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Inconsistent Enforcement of Permissions:** The core issue is that the application doesn't consistently apply the field-level visibility permissions when creating custom views.
    *   **Bypass of Access Controls:** The custom view creation process allows users to access and potentially expose fields they are not supposed to see based on their profile settings.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive information they are normally restricted from seeing in Calendar entries, such as visibility settings, locations, or recurrence details.
    *   **Circumvention of Security Policy:** The vulnerability breaks the principle of least privilege and undermines the intended security posture configured through profile-based field access controls.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Authenticated User:**  An attacker would need to be a user with an existing profile in vtiger CRM.
    *   **Custom View Creation:** The attack vector involves exploiting the custom view creation functionality within the Calendar module.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have a user account within the vtiger CRM system.
    *   The attacker does not need administrative privileges, but they would require the ability to create custom views in the Calendar module.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided changeset ([http://trac.vtiger.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/changeset/12407](http://trac.vtiger.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/changeset/12407)) shows the code modifications made to address this vulnerability.  Specifically, changes are made to `ListViewUtils.php` file to check field visibility permissions during the creation of custom views for the Calendar module.
*   The ticket ([http://trac.vtiger.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/ticket/4208](http://trac.vtiger.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/ticket/4208)) provides context and shows the progression of the issue through its lifecycle including the fix, marked as "fixed".

In summary, CVE-2009-3251 is a privilege escalation vulnerability that stems from insufficient access control enforcement in the custom view creation process of the vtiger CRM calendar module. It allows users to potentially bypass restrictions and access normally hidden data by creating a custom view, a flaw that has been addressed with code modifications.
