Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `year` parameter of the `index.php` script when the `view` parameter is set to `calendar`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as the database version, username, and database name using `union select` statements.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Depending on the database permissions, an attacker could potentially perform other malicious operations, such as modifying or deleting data, or potentially gaining remote code execution on the underlying server in severe cases.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable web application, specifically to the `index.php` file. The request must include the `view=calendar`, `month=1` (or another value), and a crafted `year` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
- Example:
  `www.TraGeT.CoM/index.php?view=calendar&month=1&year=1+and+1=0+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,concat_ws(0x3a,@@version,user(),database()),7--`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application over the network (typically over the internet).
- No authentication is required for exploiting this particular vulnerability; it's directly exploitable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit example shows the use of `concat_ws` function to combine multiple database information and return them as a result.
- The provided exploit demonstrates that the attacker has the knowledge of common SQL functions, can construct a SQL `union select` statement, and inject the SQL query through the `year` parameter.
- The exploit targets the "Uiga Church Portal" software.
- The Exploit Database entry mentions also CVE-2009-3081, but only the exploit for CVE-2009-3116 is covered in this entry.
