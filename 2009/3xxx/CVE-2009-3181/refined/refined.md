{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization within the 'settemplate.php' file, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into a configuration file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the system. The LFI vulnerability could be exploited to view sensitive files on the server. The XSS vulnerabilities could be leveraged to perform actions on behalf of users or to redirect users to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The RCE vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted request to 'settemplate.php' with malicious PHP code embedded within the 'siteTitle' parameter and a modified file path containing null byte.",
    "The LFI vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the 'template' parameter in 'index.php' to include a path to a local file.",
    "The XSS vulnerabilities are triggered by injecting malicious scripts into the 'user' parameter of 'user.php' or the 'lookup' parameter of 'search.php'."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and needs to know the location of the vulnerable Gazelle CMS instance. For the RCE to be successful, the `magic_quotes_gpc` PHP setting needs to be turned off on the server."
