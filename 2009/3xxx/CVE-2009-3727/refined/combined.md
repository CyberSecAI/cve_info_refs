Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2009-008

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | SIP responses expose valid usernames |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Information leak |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote Unauthenticated Sessions |
| **Severity** | Minor |
| **Exploits Known** | No |
| **Reported On** | October 26, 2009 |
| **Reported By** | Patrik Karlsson <patrik AT cqure DOT net> |

| **Advisory Contact** | Joshua Colp <jcolp AT digium DOT com> |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2009-3727 |

| **Description** | It is possible to determine if a peer with a specific name is configured in Asterisk by sending a specially crafted REGISTER message twice. The username that is to be checked is put in the user portion of the URI in the To header. A bogus non-matching value is put into the username portion of the Digest in the Authorization header. If the peer does exist the second REGISTER will receive a response of â403 Authentication user name does not match account nameâ. If the peer does not exist the response will be â404 Not Foundâ if alwaysauthreject is disabled and â401 Unauthorizedâ if alwaysauthreject is enabled. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : asterisk
Vulnerability  : several vulnerabilities
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-0041 CVE-2008-3903 CVE-2009-3727 CVE-2008-7220 CVE-2009-4055 CVE-2007-2383
Debian Bug     : 513413 522528 554487 554486 559103

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in asterisk, an Open Source
PBX and telephony toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-0041

It is possible to determine valid login names via probing, due to the
IAX2 response from asterisk (AST-2009-001).

CVE-2008-3903

It is possible to determine a valid SIP username, when Digest
authentication and authalwaysreject are enabled (AST-2009-003).

CVE-2009-3727

It is possible to determine a valid SIP username via multiple crafted
REGISTER messages (AST-2009-008).

CVE-2008-7220 CVE-2007-2383

It was discovered that asterisk contains an obsolete copy of the
Prototype JavaScript framework, which is vulnerable to several security
issues. This copy is unused and now removed from asterisk
(AST-2009-009).

CVE-2009-4055

It was discovered that it is possible to perform a denial of service
attack via  RTP comfort noise payload with a long data length
(AST-2009-010).

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny1.

The security support for asterisk in the oldstable distribution (etch)
has been discontinued before the end of the regular Etch security
maintenance life cycle. You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to
stable.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1:1.6.2.0~rc7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

Upgrade instructions
