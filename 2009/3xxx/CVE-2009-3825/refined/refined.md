{
  "Root cause": "The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient input sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "LFI in /show.php via the 'p' parameter using path traversal.",
    "LFI in /admin/pages/SiteNew.php via the 'Template' POST parameter using path traversal."
    ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or executing arbitrary code if a PHP file is included.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET request to /show.php with a crafted 'p' parameter.",
    "HTTP POST request to /admin/pages/SiteNew.php with a crafted 'Template' parameter."
     ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are needed.",
  "More details": "The exploit details show the exact vulnerable code lines and the Proof of Concept (PoC) URLs and POST requests to trigger the vulnerabilities. Null byte termination (%00) is used to bypass checks by cutting off extensions such as '.php' or '.htm'. Specifically, in /show.php, the $param GET parameter is used to construct the file path, and in /admin/pages/SiteNew.php the Template POST parameter is used to include a config.php file, both without sufficient input sanitization."
