The provided content describes multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities related to how different web browsers handle redirects, specifically those using `javascript:` and `data:` URIs within `Location` and `Refresh` headers.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause across all described attacks is the browser's improper handling of `javascript:` and `data:` URIs when they are encountered in the `Location` or `Refresh` headers of HTTP responses, particularly during redirects. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper URI Handling:** The core vulnerability lies in the browsers' failure to properly sanitize or block the execution of JavaScript code embedded within `javascript:` and `data:` URIs in redirect headers.
*   **Lack of Contextual Isolation:** In some cases, the JavaScript code is executed within the context of the vulnerable website, allowing access to cookies and other sensitive information. This is a severe form of XSS attack.
*   **Social Engineering:** In scenarios where the injected JavaScript does not execute in the context of the vulnerable site, the vulnerability can be used for phishing attacks, where users are tricked into entering credentials or other sensitive information on a fake page controlled by the attacker.
*   **Bypass of security filters:** By using `data:` URI, the attacker can bypass anti-phishing and anti-malware filters since the URL is not an `http:` address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cookie Theft:** When JavaScript code executes within the context of the vulnerable site, attackers can steal cookies, potentially gaining access to user accounts.
*   **Account Takeover:** By stealing cookies and session data, attackers can take over user accounts and perform actions on behalf of the victim.
*  **Phishing:** Attackers can redirect victims to fake login pages to steal credentials.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can use this method to spread malware by injecting malicious scripts.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to various malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Redirectors:** The primary attack vector involves redirectors, which are scripts that redirect users to a different URL using `Location` or `Refresh` headers.
*   **Manipulated Parameters:** Attackers manipulate the parameters of the redirector script to insert malicious `javascript:` or `data:` URIs.
*   **HTTP Headers:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by specially crafted HTTP responses that include the malicious URI in the `Location` or `Refresh` headers.
*  **Social Engineering:** For some attacks, user interaction (e.g., clicking a link on a browser-generated "Object Moved" page) is required to trigger the execution of injected code

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Inject Parameters:** Attackers need the ability to inject malicious parameters into a redirector script.
*   **Access to a Redirector:** The attacker needs access to a vulnerable redirector service or the ability to create their own.
*   **Web Server Configuration:** The attack requires a web server to respond with a crafted HTTP redirect (301 or 302) that includes a malicious URI within the `Location` or `Refresh` header.
* **Social Engineering (Some cases):** Some attacks rely on the victim clicking on a browser-generated link after the redirect.

**Specific Attacks Described:**

*   **Attack #1:** XSS via `refresh-header` redirectors using `javascript:` URI. Affects older versions of Mozilla, Firefox, IE, Opera, and Chrome. Code executes in context of the site.
*   **Attack #2:** XSS via `refresh-header` redirectors using `data:` URI. Affects older Mozilla, Firefox, and Chrome. Code does not execute in the context of the site in modern browsers.
*   **Attack #3:** XSS via `location-header` redirectors using `data:` URI. Affects Firefox and Opera. Code does not execute in the context of the site.
*   **Attack #4:** XSS via `location-header` redirectors (using "302 Object moved") with `javascript:` URI. Affects older Mozilla and Firefox. Code executes in context of the site after a click from user.
*   **Attack #5:** XSS via `location-header` redirectors with any 301 or 302 response, using `javascript:` URI. Affects Maxthon 3 Alpha. Code does not execute in context of the site.
*  **Attack #6:** XSS via `location-header` redirectors (using "302 Found") with `javascript:` URI. Affects older Mozilla and Firefox. Code executes in context of the site after a click from user.
*   **Attacks #7,8:** XSS via redirectors with status 301 and 303, using `data:` and `javascript:` URIs.
