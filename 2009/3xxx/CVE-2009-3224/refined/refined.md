```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the 's' parameter within the index.php script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, or even complete compromise of the database server.
- Attack vectors:  The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted GET request to index.php, specifically by manipulating the 's' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific user privileges are needed, as the vulnerability is exploitable through a simple GET request.
