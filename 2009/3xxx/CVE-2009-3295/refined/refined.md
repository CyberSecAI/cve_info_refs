Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-3295:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A null pointer dereference occurs within the KDC (Key Distribution Center) cross-realm referral processing code. This code was introduced in MIT krb5 version 1.7.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The `kdc_err()` function is called with a null pointer as the format string when a specific error condition occurs in the `prep_reprocess_req()` function within the `do_tgs_req.c` file. This results in a crash when the code attempts to dereference this null pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker can crash the KDC, making it unavailable for Kerberos authentication. This can disrupt services that rely on Kerberos.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cross-Realm Referrals:** The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of cross-realm referrals. This occurs when a client requests a ticket for a host-based service principal name, which may necessitate referrals to other Kerberos realms.
- **Error Condition Trigger:** The specific error condition that triggers the vulnerability is a failure to find the realm for a host.
- **Legitimate Requests:** Legitimate requests can also cause this crash.
  
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user. Authentication via cross-realm Kerberos may be sufficient.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the KDC.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is an implementation issue within MIT krb5, and not within the Kerberos protocol itself.
- The vulnerable code was introduced in krb5-1.7
- The vulnerability is fixed in krb5-1.7.1
- A workaround is available to disable the realm referral capability by using the "no_host_referral = *" setting.
