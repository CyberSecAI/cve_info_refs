  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the use of `register_globals = on` in the PHP configuration, which allows an attacker to directly set the `login_ok` variable through the URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Authentication bypass due to insecure handling of the login process.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful bypass of the authentication mechanism, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `login_ok` parameter in the URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges or network position is required."
