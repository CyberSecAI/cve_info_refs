# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-071 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Internet Authentication Service Could Allow Remote Code Execution (974318)

Published: December 08, 2009 | Updated: December 09, 2009

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The more severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if messages received by the Internet Authentication Service server are copied incorrectly into memory when handling PEAP authentication attempts. On Windows Server 2008, the Internet Authentication Service is replaced by Network Policy Server (NPS). An attacker who successfully exploited either of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. Servers using Internet Authentication Service or Network Policy Server are only affected when using PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 authentication.

This security update is rated Critical for Windows Server 2008 for 32-bit Systems Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2008 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 2. For all other affected and supported releases of Windows, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way Internet Authentication Service validates authentication requests by PEAP clients. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.**  The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

## Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2505

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in implementations of Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) on the Internet Authentication Service. The vulnerability is due to incorrect copying into memory of messages received by the server when handling PEAP authentication attempts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-2505](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2505).

#### Mitigating Factors for Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2505

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Servers using Internet Authentication Service are only affected when configured to use PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 authentication.

#### Workarounds for Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2505

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use an authentication protocol other than PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 on your Internet Authentication Service server**

  **Impact of workaround.** Changing authentication protocols may require reconfiguration of clients.

#### FAQ for Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2505

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the PEAP authentication requests. This could lead to an error while copying specific memory structures when the IAS server deals with PEAP authentication attempts.

**What is the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)?**

Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) is a member of the family of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) protocols. PEAP uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to create an encrypted channel between an authenticating PEAP client, such as a mobile computer communicating over a wireless network, and a PEAP authenticator, such as an Internet Authentication Service (IAS) or Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server. PEAP does not specify an authentication method, but provides additional security for other EAP authentication protocols, such as EAP-MS-CHAP v2, that can operate through the TLS encrypted channel provided by PEAP. PEAP is used as an authentication method for 802.1X wireless client computers, but is not supported for virtual private network (VPN) or other remote access clients.

**What is the Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAP v2)?**

MS-CHAP uses a challenge-response mechanism to authenticate connections without sending any passwords. MS-CHAP v2 provides mutual authentication, the generation of stronger initial data encryption keys for Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE), and different encryption keys for sent and received data. To minimize the risk of password compromise during a password change, support for older methods of the MS-CHAP password change is not included.

MS-CHAP v2 is a mutual authentication protocol, which means that both the client and the server prove that they have knowledge of the user's password. First, the remote access server asks the remote access client for proof by sending a challenge to the client. Then the remote access client asks the remote access server for proof by sending a challenge back to the server. If the server cannot prove that it has knowledge of the user's password by correctly answering the challenge from the client, the client terminates the connection. Without mutual authentication, a remote access client cannot establish a connection to an unauthorized remote access server.

**What are Internet Authentication Service and Network Policy Server?**

In Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Internet Authentication Service (IAS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server. As a RADIUS server, IAS performs centralized connection authentication, authorization, and accounting for many types of network access, including wireless and virtual private network (VPN) connections. On Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, IAS does not support RADIUS Proxy because it is based on the Option Pack version.

In Windows Server 2003, Internet Authentication Service (IAS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server and proxy. As a RADIUS server, IAS performs centralized connection authentication, authorization, and accounting for many types of network access, including wireless and virtual private network (VPN) connections. As a RADIUS proxy, IAS forwards authentication and accounting messages to other RADIUS servers.

Network Policy Server (NPS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server and proxy in Windows Server 2008. NPS is the replacement for Internet Authentication Service (IAS) in Windows Server 2003.

Both Internet Authentication Service and Network Policy Server expose the PEAP MS-CHAP v2 code that is affected by this vulnerability.

**Why is the severity of the vulnerability Important on Windows operating system clients?**

Windows operating system clients contain the vulnerable MS-CHAP v2 code, but none of the components included as part of the operating systems use this code in a way that may expose the vulnerability. Theoretically, a third-party application that supports authentication using MS-CHAP v2 could render a system vulnerable. As clients are not intended to provide this type of functionality, this is an unlikely scenario. However, Microsoft is providing an update as part of this security bulletin that addresses the root cause on client platforms.

**Why is the severity of the vulnerability Important on Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems?**

Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems does not allow installation of the Internet Authentication Service. However, the vulnerable binaries are present on the machine. Theoretically, a third-party application that supports authentication using MS-CHAP v2 could render a system vulnerable. As these servers are not intended to provide this type of functionality, this is an unlikely scenario. However, Microsoft is providing an update as part of this security bulletin that addresses the root cause on Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with administrator privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an incorrectly formed PEAP authentication request to an IAS server.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Internet Authentication Services servers that allow remote, untrusted users to authenticate are at particular risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update changes IAS to correctly validate MS-CHAP v2 authentication requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## MS-CHAP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3677

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Internet Authentication Service. An attacker could send a specially crafted Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAP v2) authentication request that could obtain access to network resources under the privileges of a specific, authorized user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-3677](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3677).

#### Mitigating Factors for MS-CHAP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3677

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Servers using Internet Authentication Service are only affected when configured to use PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 authentication.

#### Workarounds for MS-CHAP Authentication Bypass in Internet Authentication Service Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3677

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use an authentication protocol other than PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 on your Internet Authentication Service server**

  **Impact of workaround.** Changing authentication protocols may require reconfiguration of the client computers.

#### FAQ for MS-CHAP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3677

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain access to network resources under the privileges of a specific authorized user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused when the Internet Authentication Service does not correctly validate an MS-CHAP v2 authentication request. This causes the server to consider the authentication request as valid, even though incorrect credentials may have been provided.

**What is the Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)?**

Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) is a member of the family of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) protocols. PEAP uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to create an encrypted channel between an authenticating PEAP client, such as a mobile computer communicating over a wireless network, and a PEAP authenticator, such as an Internet Authentication Service (IAS) or Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server. PEAP does not specify an authentication method, but provides additional security for other EAP authentication protocols, such as EAP-MS-CHAP v2, that can operate through the TLS encrypted channel provided by PEAP. PEAP is used as an authentication method for 802.1X wireless client computers, but is not supported for virtual private network (VPN) or other remote access clients.

**What is the Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2 (MS-CHAP v2)?**

MS-CHAP uses a challenge-response mechanism to authenticate connections without sending any passwords. MS-CHAP v2 provides mutual authentication, the generation of stronger initial data encryption keys for Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE), and different encryption keys for sent and received data. To minimize the risk of password compromise during a password change, support for older methods of the MS-CHAP password change is not included.

MS-CHAP v2 is a mutual authentication protocol, which means that both the client and the server prove that they have knowledge of the user's password. First, the remote access server asks the remote access client for proof by sending a challenge to the client. Then the remote access client asks the remote access server for proof by sending a challenge back to the server. If the server cannot prove that it has knowledge of the user's password by correctly answering the challenge from the client, the client terminates the connection. Without mutual authentication, a remote access client cannot establish a connection to an unauthorized remote access server.

**What are Internet Authentication Service and Network Policy Server?**

In Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Internet Authentication Service (IAS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server. As a RADIUS server, IAS performs centralized connection authentication, authorization, and accounting for many types of network access, including wireless and virtual private network (VPN) connections. On Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, IAS does not support RADIUS Proxy because it is based on the Option Pack version.

In Windows Server 2003, Internet Authentication Service (IAS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server and proxy. As a RADIUS server, IAS performs centralized connection authentication, authorization, and accounting for many types of network access, including wireless and virtual private network (VPN) connections. As a RADIUS proxy, IAS forwards authentication and accounting messages to other RADIUS servers.

Network Policy Server (NPS) is the Microsoft implementation of a Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server and proxy in Windows Server 2008. NPS is the replacement for Internet Authentication Service (IAS) in Windows Server 2003.

Both Internet Authentication Service and Network Policy Server expose the PEAP MS-CHAP v2 code that is affected by this vulnerability.

**Why is the severity of the vulnerability Moderate on Windows operating system clients?**

Windows operating system clients contain the vulnerable MS-CHAP v2 code, but none of the components included as part of the operating systems use this code in a way that may expose the vulnerability. Theoretically, a third-party application that supports authentication using MS-CHAP v2 could render a system vulnerable. As clients are not intended to provide this type of functionality, this is an unlikely scenario. However, Microsoft is providing an update as part of this security bulletin that addresses the root cause on client operating systems.

**Why is the severity of the vulnerability Moderate on Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems?**

Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems does not allow installation of the Internet Authentication Service. However, the vulnerable binaries are present on the machine. Theoretically, a third-party application that supports authentication using MS-CHAP v2 could render a system vulnerable. As these servers are not intended to provide this type of functionality, this is an unlikely scenario. However, Microsoft is providing an update as part of this security bulletin that addresses the root cause on Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to network resources under the privileges of a specific, authorized user. Note that depending on the authentication requirements of the applications hosted by the network, the user may not directly have access to specific data or information.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an incorrectly formed MS-CHAP v2 authentication request to the Internet Authentication Service.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems that use the Internet Authentication Service to provide external users with access to network resources are particularly affected by this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

This update addresses the vulnerability by changing IAS to correctly validate MS-CHAP v2 authentication requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
