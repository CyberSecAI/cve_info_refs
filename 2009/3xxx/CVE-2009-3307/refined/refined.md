{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files using a variable without proper sanitization, leading to Remote File Inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `FSPHP_LIB` parameter in the URL when accessing vulnerable files such as `lib/FSphp.php`, `lib/navigation.php`, and `lib/pathwirte.php`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They need to have knowledge of the vulnerable files and the vulnerable parameter name (`FSPHP_LIB`)."
