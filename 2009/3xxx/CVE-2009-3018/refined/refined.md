The provided content describes multiple XSS vulnerabilities related to how browsers handle redirects, specifically when using `javascript:` and `data:` URIs within `Location` and `Refresh` headers. This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the browsers' insufficient sanitization and handling of `javascript:` and `data:` URIs within the `Location` and `Refresh` headers during redirects. This allows attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper handling of `javascript:` URIs in `Refresh` headers:** Several browsers (Mozilla 1.7.x, Firefox <=3.0.8, IE6, Opera <=9.52, Chrome <=1.0.154.48) execute javascript code when redirected to `javascript:` URI using `Refresh` header.
- **Improper handling of `data:` URIs in `Refresh` headers:** Browsers (Mozilla 1.7.x, Firefox <= 3.0.12, Chrome <=1.0.154.48) execute code from data URI when redirected via `Refresh` header.
- **Improper handling of `data:` URIs in `Location` headers:** Browsers (Firefox <= 3.0.12, Opera <= 9.52) execute code from data URI when redirected via `Location` header.
- **Improper handling of `javascript:` URIs in `Location` headers with 302 redirects:** Browsers (Mozilla 1.7.x, Firefox <= 3.0.12) execute javascript code when redirected to `javascript:` URI using `Location` header with 302 "Object Moved" response, requiring user interaction (click on link).
- **Improper handling of `javascript:` URIs in `Location` headers with 301/302 redirects in Maxthon:** Maxthon 3 Alpha with Ultramode executes javascript code when redirected to `javascript:` URI using `Location` header with 301/302 response requiring user interaction (click on link).
- **Improper handling of `javascript:` URIs in `Location` headers with 302 Found:** Browsers (Mozilla 1.7.x, Firefox <= 3.0.19) execute javascript code when redirected to `javascript:` URI using `Location` header with 302 "Found" response, requiring user interaction (click on link).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable website (in certain cases), potentially leading to:
  - Stealing cookies, session tokens, and sensitive information.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
  - Defacing websites.
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Phishing attacks:** Attackers can use the injected JavaScript code for phishing attempts.
- **Malware spreading:** The vulnerabilities can be used to spread malware through redirection services by injecting malicious code instead of redirection addresses.
- **Bypass of anti-phishing and anti-malware filters:** By using `data:` URIs, attackers can bypass filters that rely on HTTP addresses.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Manipulated redirector parameters:** An attacker can craft a URL containing a malicious `javascript:` or `data:` URI as a parameter of a redirector script.
- **Redirection services abuse:** Attackers can utilize vulnerable redirection services by injecting malicious code instead of redirection URLs.
- **Social engineering:** For vulnerabilities related to the "Object Moved" or "Found" page, attackers rely on user interaction (clicking on the link) to execute the payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to control redirector parameters:** The attacker needs to control the parameters of the redirector script that will be used in the attack.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable browsers and redirector usage:** The attacker needs to be aware of which browsers are vulnerable to these types of attacks and how redirectors are used on the target site.
- **Social engineering:** In some cases, user interaction (clicking on a link) is needed to execute the payload.
