Based on the above -^ I would vote for separate CVE identifier for expat flaw
(and its embedded copies in dozen of packages):

<https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280615#c8>
<https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280615#c10>

To remember sounding of CVE-2009-2625:
---------------------------------------

Apache Xerces2 Java, as used in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK
and JRE 6 before Update 15 and JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 20, and
in other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(infinite loop and application hang) via malformed XML input, as
demonstrated by the Codenomicon XML fuzzing framework.

Argumentation for new CVE id:
-----------------------------
a, CVE-2009-2625 doesn't mention expat (just "other products", this could
    be fixed though)
b, The impact differs on Apache Xerces2 Java (infinite loop and application
    hang, 100% cpu use -- have checked unpatched java-1.6.0-openjdk) and in expat
    (clean crash) - gdb output attached for both testcases.

Steve, Josh, which way would be easier to follow?
i, mention expat in CVE-2009-2625, change impact to DoS (crash)
    via malformed XML file, which triggers UTF-8 parser crash? or
ii. assign new CVE id for expat (and its embedded copies) with
     clean impact description and note that crash happens in UTF-8
     parser?

Opinions, ACKs, NACKs appreciated.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

Sorry about that. We will make our future advisories more explicit on
the CVE references and the details. The test-suite/fuzzing tool projects
sometimes make it pretty complicated to handle all the separate issues
in a proper way. I am trying to clarify some of the confusion in my
answers here.

The expat and/or Xerces -maintainers are probably the right people to
give a comprehensive answer for questions 1-3. However, based on the
code I have been reading during the coordination, I think that expat and
Xerces do not share much code.

Yes, these are two distinct issues with significantly different reproducers.

I managed to misunderstand the only question Robert had for us. Even
though the question was pretty clear. There probably is not a CVE for
the expat crash (which affected Python expat too) yet. As the original
issue was not handled by us and it was found already back in 2008, we
did not allocate a CVE for the Python expat issue. So we probably need a
CVE for the expat crash. I assume we could use this CVE for the Python
expat crash too since the root cause is the same.

We are not aware of any other problems. In addition to the billion
laughs issue with some code using expat, the only recent expat issue we
are aware of is this segfault in expat's updatePosition -function when
parsing multibyte characters. Our advisory does not cover any other
expat issues than the Python expat -related part of the latter one.

The billion laughs attack was not covered in the CERT-FI advisory.

I hope this clarifies the situation. I am sorry for the confusion for
our part.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

### [amd64 – Advanced choices](#amd64-advanced)

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *amd64* architecture is intended for use on AMD 64-bit CPUs as well as 64-bit **Intel Pentium/Core/Xeon** processors.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.

    [1] [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/2025/focus=2032](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/2025/focus%3D2032)

1, <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2473>
    Patch: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=357950>

2, <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1955>
    Patch: <http://marc.info/?l=apr-dev&m=124396021826125&w=2>

    When looking at the patches, while the source code bases (patches)
    are different, the XML reproducer is the same - so is different
    source code sufficient to distinguish the CVE ids, or should
    they be merged?

3, <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1885>
    Patch:
<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/xerces/c/trunk/src/xercesc/validators/DTD/DTDScanner.cpp?r1=709149&r2=781488&pathrev=781488>

    The testcases here were provided by CERT-FI and are the
    same as for:

    <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2414>
    <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2416>

    But different CVE identifiers needed to be used, due the
    fact, CVE-2009-1885 issue was disclosed earlier, than
    other vendors were prepared to release libxml2 updates.

    They also affect different code bases: CVE-2009-1885
    Apache Xerces C++, while CVE-2009-2414, CVE-2009-2416 libxml / libxml2.

4, <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2625>
    CVE originally assigned to Apache Xerces2 Java (does it embed
    its own copy of expat), but also reported as expat issue here:
      <http://expat.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/expat/expat/lib/xmltok_impl.c?view=log>

    Expat patch:
      <http://expat.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/expat/expat/lib/xmltok_impl.c?r1=1.13&r2=1.15&view=patch>

    The expat library is embedded also in:
      a, w3c-libwww <http://www.w3.org/Library>
      b, PyXML <http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/>

    And probably also in other packages (still need to get the complete list). In this case,
    the reproducer, code base and patch are the same, just the expat library is embedded
    in multiple other products. Two questions remain to be answered here:

    a, Does Apache Xerces2 Java contain embedded copy ot the expat library (i.e. it's
       completely the same issue as in expat, w3c-libwww, PyXML and others) - Marc
       could you help to reply this question?

    b, Can we use CVE-2009-2625 to reference expat, w3c-libwww(expat), PyXML (expat)
       issues too or another one need to be assigned for these? (But the decision
       depends on the answer to previous question).

Hoping this will bring at least a little bit more light into above [1] doubts

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice\_org does not allow macros written in Python to
be executed without permission, CVE-2010-0395.
This also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.2.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.2.1.html>
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2-slms
Insufficient quoting of parameters in SLMS could allow for
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) attacks (CVE-2010-1325).
Affected Products: SLE11
- aria2
This aria2 update to 1.9.3 fixes a metalink name Directory Traversal
issue (CVE-2010-1512).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- bogofilter
This update of bogofilter/bogolexer fixes a heap based buffer underflow
vulnerability which could be exploited to cause a denial of service or
potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2494).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cifs-mount/samba
This update of the Samba server package fixes security issues and bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2010-2063: A buffer overrun was possible in chain\_reply code in
3.3.x and below, which could be used to crash the
samba server or potentially execute code.
- CVE-2010-0787: Take extra care that a mount point of mount.cifs is
not changed during mount.
- CVE-2010-0926: With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links
on the server side, therefore allowing clients to
overwrite arbitrary files. This update changes the
default setting to have "wide links" disabled by default.
The new default only works if "wide links" is not set
explicitly in smb.conf.
- CVE-2010-0547: Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker
could corrupt /etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid
root. mount.cifs is not setuid root by default and it is
not recommended to change that.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- clamav
This update fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow (CVE-2010-1640) and a
crash while parsing PDFs (CVE-2010-1639, CVE-2010-2077) in clamav
that can be used as a remote denial of service attack.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- exim
Two local vulnerabilities have been fixed in the exim MTA
which allowed attackers to create arbitrary files or
to change ownership of arbitrary files. CVE-2010-2023 and
CVE-2010-2024 have been assigned to these issues.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- ghostscript
Specially crafted postscript (.ps) files could cause buffer
overflows in ghostscript that could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-1628, CVE-2010-1869, CVE-2009-4270)
Additionally ghostscript, by default, reads some initialization files from
the current working directory. Local attackers could potentially exploit
that to have other users execute arbitrary commands by placing such
files e.g. in /tmp (CVE-2010-2055).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- gnutls
The ASN.1 parser for X.509 certificates used a wrong integer type for
extracting a certficiate's serial number. On 64bit big-endian
architectures this could result in bypassing CRL checks (CVE-2010-0731).
Affected Products: SLES9
- krb5
This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability in kadmind. A
remote attack can send a malformed GSS-API token that triggers a
NULL pointer dereference.

arbitrary CTCP commands. (CVE-2010-2785)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- lftp
This update of lftp improves the filename handling of downloaded files
to avoid downloading arbitrary content to unexpected locations (like
.login). (CVE-2010-2251)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libpython2\_6-1\_0
This update of python has a copy of libxmlrpc that is vulnerable to
denial of service bugs that can occur while processing malformed XML
input.
- CVE-2009-2625: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Permissions, Privileges,

to a corrupted heap memory. This bug can be exploited remotely with a
crafted TIFF file to cause an application crash or probably to execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2010-1411)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libvorbis
This update of libvorbis fixes a memory corruption while parsing OGG
files. This bug was exploitable by remote attackers to cause an
application crash and could probably be exploited to execute arbitrary
code.

Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- lxsession
lxsession-logout did not properly lock the screen before suspending,
hibernating and switching between users which could allow attackers with
physical access to take control of the system to obtain sensitive infor-
mation and / or execute arbitrary code in the context of the user who is
currently logged in (CVE-2010-2532).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- mono-addon-bytefx-data-mysql/bytefx-data-mysql
Mono's ASP.NET implementation did not set the 'EnableViewStateMac'
property by default. Attackers could exploit that to conduct cross-
site-scripting (XSS) attacks. (CVE-2010-1459)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- moodle

(CVE-2010-0211 and CVE-2010-0212)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- opera
Opera was upgraded to the 10.60 release.
- CVE-2010-0653: Opera permits cross-origin loading of CSS style sheets
even when the style sheet download has an incorrect
MIME type and the style sheet document is malformed,
which allows remote HTTP servers to obtain sensitive
information via a crafted document.
- CVE-2010-1993: Opera 9.52 does not properly handle an IFRAME element
with a mailto: URL in its SRC attribute, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
consumption) via an HTML document with many IFRAME
elements.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- otrs
OTRS was prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities which could
allow remote authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code via
unspecified vectors. (CVE-2010-0438)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- popt
This update fixes the problem where RPM misses to clear the SUID/SGID
bit of old files during package updates. (CVE-2010-2059)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- postgresql
This update of postgresql was pblished to fix several minor security
vulnerabilities:
- CVE-2010-1975: postgresql does not properly check privileges during
certain RESET ALL operations, which allows remote
authenticated users to remove arbitrary parameter
settings.
- CVE-2010-1170: The PL/Tcl implementation in postgresql loads Tcl
code from the pltcl\_modules table regardless of the
table's ownership and permissions, which allows remote
authenticated users, with database-creation privileges,
to execute arbitrary Tcl code.
- CVE-2010-1169: Postgresql does not properly restrict PL/perl procedures,
which allows remote authenticated users, with database-
creation privileges, to execute arbitrary Perl code via
a crafted script.
- CVE-2010-0733: An integer overflow in postgresql allows remote authen-
ticated users to crash the daemon via a SELECT statement.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- python-mako
Python-mako was prone to a Cross-Site Scripting flaw due to improperly
escaped single quotes (CVE-2010-2480).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- squidGuard
Two buffer overflows in squidGard were fixed:
- CVE-2009-3700: Buffer overflow in sgLog.c in squidGuard 1.3 and 1.4
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application hang or loss of blocking functionality)
via a long URL with many / (slash) characters, related
to "emergency mode."
- CVE-2009-3826: Multiple buffer overflows in squidGuard 1.4 allow remote
attackers to bypass intended URL blocking via a long URL,
related to (1) the relationship between a certain buffer
size in squidGuard and a certain buffer size in Squid and
(2) a redirect URL that contains information about the
originally requested URL.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- vte
VTE was vulnerable to an old title set+query attack which could be used
by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2713).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- w3m
w3m did not handle embedded nul characters in the common name and in
subject alternative names of x509 certificates.
CVE-2010-2074 has been assigned to this issue.
This update also turns on verification of x509 certificates by default
which was not the case before.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- xmlrpc-c
This update of libxmlrpc is not vulnerable to denial of service bugs
that can occur while processing malformed XML input.
- CVE-2009-2625: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0: Permissions, Privileges,

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Subject: expat bug 1990430

Hello,

we have learned that expat fixed a crash issue in June 2008, but never
released an update. The bug was apparantly intended to be kept private,
but the bug changes were mailed to a public mailing list and Python
developrs menitoned the bug fix in their public svn (including NEWS
file, and reproducers):

<http://mail.python.org/pipermail/expat-bugs/2009-January/002781.html>
<http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1990430&group_id=10127&atid=110127>
<http://svn.python.org/view?view=rev&revision=74429>
<https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280615>

While the expat bug was reported by Peter Valchev of Google, Python
credits Ivan Krstić of Apple with the patch (submission).
It might also be related to CVE-2009-2625 / FICORA #245608:
<https://www.cert.fi/en/reports/2009/vulnerability2009085.html>

As CERT-FI never released any details or test cases, I have no idea if
we need a new CVE of if those two issues are the same.

Robert

## Details

USN-890-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Expat. This update provides the

corresponding updates for CMake.

Original advisory details:

Jukka Taimisto, Tero Rontti and Rauli Kaksonen discovered that Expat did

not properly process malformed XML. If a user or application linked against

Expat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause

a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2009-2625](/security/CVE-2009-2625), [CVE-2009-3720](/security/CVE-2009-3720))

It was discovered that Expat did not properly process malformed UTF-8

sequences. If a user or application linked against Expat were tricked into

opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2009-3560](/security/CVE-2009-3560))

- libmozhelper-1\_0-0/mozilla-xulrunner190
The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.1
- libopenssl-devel

- seamonkey
This update brings Mozilla Seamonkey to 1.1.19 fixing various bugs and
security issues.
Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=531697#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-29 08:31:08 UTC  ``` Peter Valchev discovered a flaw in the way expat handled malformed UTF-8 sequences when processing XML files.  Incorrect UTF-8 sequenced could cause expat to fail to properly detect end of input and continue reading behind the end of input buffer.  This results in a crash once reading reaches unmapped memory.  Non-public upstream bug report: <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=1990430&group_id=10127&atid=110127>  Contents of the report leaked via expat-bugs mailing list posts: <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/expat-bugs/2009-January/002781.html>  Upstream patch: <http://expat.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/expat/expat/lib/xmltok_impl.c?r1=1.13&r2=1.15>  References: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=551936> <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280615>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=531697#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-29 08:32:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 366572](attachment.cgi?id=366572 "pythontest1.xml test case") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=366572&action=edit "pythontest1.xml test case") pythontest1.xml test case  Source: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280615#c4>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=531697#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-29 08:33:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 366573](attachment.cgi?id=366573 "pythontest2.xml test case") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=366573&action=edit "pythontest2.xml test case") pythontest2.xml test case  Source: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280615#c5>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=531697#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-29 08:43:56 UTC  ``` Similar problem was found in xerces-j2, an XML parses used in Java JREs / JDKs.

For whatever reason, the same pyexpat.so module is built on RHEL5 and earlier, but without this loop in the spec (and whether as a by-product of the build, I'm not sure) is definitely linked against the system expat as shown when removing expat from a RHEL5 system and trying to run the reproducer, I get "ImportError: libexpat.so.0: cannot open shared object file".   ```  [Comment 56](show_bug.cgi?id=531697#c56)  Vincent Danen    2010-03-04 15:35:41 UTC  ``` Python contains its own copy of expat, which makes it vulnerable to this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4 and above.  However, the vulnerability in python is masked due to PyXML (which has been updated); when PyXML is installed, python will use its expat rather than its own internal expat (i.e. /usr/lib/python2.x/lib-dynload/pyexpat.so).  Technically, PyXML should always be installed and when it is, python is not vulnerable to this issue.  If PyXML gets removed from the system, then python is using its own expat and then becomes vulnerable to the issue.  PyXML is a dependency for 4Suite and system-config-printer on RHEL4, and system-config-printer-libs on RHEL5.  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, python is linked against the system expat and is not vulnerable to this issue, even if PyXML is removed.   ```  [Comment 57](show_bug.cgi?id=531697#c57)  Silvio Cesare    2010-11-12 03:49:03 UTC  ``` Expat is embedded in a number of other packages:  Affects libtlen where a bug has been filed [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=652502](show_bug.cgi?id=652502 "CLOSED ERRATA - libtlen contains an embedded copy of expat, prone to CVE-2009-3720")  Also affects and currently unreported:   udinits2   nodeupdown-backend-ganglia   mcabber   centerim  I will file additional bug reports for these.   ```  [Comment 58](show_bug.cgi?id=531697#c58)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-29 21:58:53 UTC  ``` Further investigation shows the following Fedora packages are affected by this flaw (using embedded expat):  SimGear: SimGear-2.0.0/simgear/xml/xmltok_impl.c torcs: torcs-1.3.1/src/libs/txml/xmltok_impl.c centerim: centerim-4.22.9/libjabber/xmltok_impl_c.h tla: tla-1.3.5/src/expat/lib/xmltok_impl.c sitecopy: sitecopy-0.16.6/lib/expat/xmltok/xmltok_impl.c  I do not know if they are all in a position to be exploited or not, but they do all use embedded expat and have the vulnerable file/function in question.

As far as we understand, the expat flaw in question is in no way related
to CVE-2009-2625, or other recent XML parser flaws. Therefore our take
is that it should have a distinct CVE entry.

Hello Steven,

are you going to assign a new identifier for expat updatePosition crash?
It seems to me the outcome of this discussion is that the issues
discovered in 2009 by the Codenomicon XML fuzzing and in 2008 by Peter
Valchev are identical, and that the CVE-2009-2625 wording is limited to
the infinite loop in a Java codebase. As a supporting factor,
CVE-2009-2625 is used by many to identify only the Java issues
(with Mandriva being an exception).

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- evolution-data-server

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Sorry for the delay.

A new CVE is not needed. These two issues (the one which was fixed in
expat CVS in June 2008 and the one with the internal copy of expat in
Python) are essentially the same. The issue seems to be first found by
Peter Valchev in June 2008. As Robert mentioned, the issue has been
fixed in expat's CVS in June 2008 but an updated release was not made
for some reason. The issue was also present in the expat bundled with
Python and it was reported to us independent from the original issue
(even though the reason of the crash is the same). CERT-FI reported the
issue to Python in July 2009. Soon after that the issue was reported to
expat maintainers too since initially we did not know that the issue was
already fixed in expat's CVS. Python's patch has been incorporated into
Python 3.1.1 but there is probably more software with an affected
internal copy of expat out there.

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 **Important**
Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

## Details

Jukka Taimisto, Tero Rontti and Rauli Kaksonen discovered that Expat did

not properly process malformed XML. If a user or application linked against

Expat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause

a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2009-2625](/security/CVE-2009-2625), [CVE-2009-3720](/security/CVE-2009-3720))

It was discovered that Expat did not properly process malformed UTF-8

sequences. If a user or application linked against Expat were tricked into

opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via

application crash. ([CVE-2009-3560](/security/CVE-2009-3560))

hi,

mandriva and gentoo used CVE-2009-2625 as their reference CVE for the
expat fixes.  debian is also currently tracking the issue with this
CVE for the time being.  however, we have not yet released fixed
packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This update adds additional improvements to avoid a race condition in
fusermount that allowed users to umount any filesystem (related to
CVE-2009-3297). Thanks to Al Viro who found it.
Additionally a race condition in fusermount was fixed that allowed non-
privileged users to umount any file system (CVE-2010-0789).
Note: this is a re-release of the previous update with a better patch.
SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2
Integer overflows in libapr could potentially be exploited to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-2412).
Specially crafted XML documents cause apache to consume large amounts
of memory (CVE-2009-1955).
Affected Products: SLES9

- error handling in subqueries (CVE-2009-4019)
- preserving null\_value flag in GeomFromWKB (CVE-2009-4019)
- symlink behavior fixed (CVE-2008-7247)
- symlink behavior refixed (CVE-2009-4030)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cpio
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow flaw that can happen
while expanding specially-crafted archive files (CVE-2010-0624).
It also contains changes for:
- fixed Dat160 Tape Drive density information (bnc#415166)
- fixed cpio issues with file sizes >= 2^32
- fixed handling eof and eod marks (bnc#371077)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11
- moodle
Moodle version 1.9.8 fixes several security issues including
cross-site-scripting (XSS) and SQL injection bugs (CVE-2010-1613,
CVE-2010-1614, CVE-2010-1615, CVE-2010-1616, CVE-2010-1617
CVE-2010-1618, CVE-2010-1619).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- libmikmod
Specially crafted "Impulse Tracker" and "Ultratracker" files could cause a
heap based buffer overflow in libmikmod. Attackers could exploit that to
crash or potentially execute code in applications linking against libmikmod
(CVE-2009-3995, CVE-2009-3996).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libicecore
This update of libxmlrpc is not vulnerable to denial of service bugs that
can occur while processing malformed XML input.
- CVE-2009-2625: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0
- CVE-2009-3720: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0
- CVE-2009-3560: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- cyrus-imapd
This update fixes another buffer overflow in the Sieve code. This can
be exploited by users allowed to use their own sieve scripts to execute
arbitrary code remotely.
CVE-2009-3235: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.5 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
Additionally the handling of long headers was improved.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- neon/libneon
neon did not properly handle embedded NUL characters in X.509
certificates when comparing host names. Attackers could exploit that
to spoof SSL servers.
CVE-2009-2408: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.5 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
Specially crafted XML documents that contain a large number of
nested entity references could cause neon to consume large amounts
of CPU and memory (CVE-2009-2473).
CVE-2009-2473: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- freeradius
This update of freeradius fixes a remote denial-of-service bug in function
rad\_decode() which can be triggered by zero-length Tunnel-Password attri-
butes to make radiusd crash.
CVE-2009-3111: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: SLE10 SP3
- strongswan
The previous fix for a flaw in the ASN.1 parser was incomplete and
had to be reworked.
This could lead to crashes of the pluto IKE daemon.
CVE-2009-2661: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: SLE10 SP3
- openldap2
This update of openldap2 makes SSL certificate verification more robust
against uses of the special character \0 in the subjects name.
CVE-2009-2408: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.5 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
Affected products: SLE10 SP3
- apache2-mod\_jk
Certain HTTP request could confuse the JK connector in Apache Tomcat which
could result in a user seeing responses destined for other users.
CVE-2008-5519: CVSS v2 Base Score: 2.6 (LOW) (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- expat
Specially crafted XML documents could make expat run into an enless loop,i
therefore locking up applications using expat.
CVE-2009-3720: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could cause buffer overflows in xpdf
when viewing such a document.
CVE-2009-3603: CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.3 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3604: CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.3 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3605: CVSS v2 Base Score: 10.0 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3606: CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.3 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3608: CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.3 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3609: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- mozilla-nspr
This update fixes a bug in the Mozilla NSPR helper libraries, which could
be used by remote attackers to potentially execute code via javascript
vectors.
MFSA 2009-59:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the execution
of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus be leveraged by
the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
CVE-2009-1563: CVSS v2 Base Score: 10.0 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0-11.1, SLE10, SLE11

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Subject: Re: Re: expat bug 1990430

Glad to see CERT-FI join the discussion.  A big factor in all this
confusion was that the original advisory did not explicitly state which
CVE was associated with which issue.  The scale of the effort also
complicates things, as happens with all PROTOS/fuzzing/test-suite projects
due the size and complexity of those efforts combined with lack of clarity
of codebase relationships and the stray coordination problem (i.e., "it
comes with the territory.")

I've been a bit concerned about CVE assignments because the lack of
details may be causing us to assign duplicate CVEs or to combine multiple
problems into a single ID.

I have several questions at this point:

1) neon "when expat is used" was subject to the billion laughs attack
   (recursion during entity expansion).  This was assigned CVE-2009-2473.
   The description for CVE-2009-2473 focuses on neon, and I haven't seen
   it used for other products.  Was this really a problem in expat?  Then
   we may have a dupe.

2) If per (1) this is really a problem in expat, then is the
   neon problem the same as CVE-2009-1955 which is described for Apache
   APR-util?  Or is apr-util an entirely different library/codebase than
   expat?

3) CVE-2009-1885 is for a stack consumption problem in Xerces C++
   involving nested parentheses and invalid byte values.  It appears that
   expat and Xerces are distinct libraries, i.e. they don't have any
   significant shared code?

4) CVE-2009-2625 is for Xerces Java which is used in JRE/JDK and
   presumably others.  The impact here is an infinite loop.  Is this
   really a distinct problem than whatever CVE-2009-1885 is talking about?

5) CERT-FI's response to the inquiry about the Python "libexpat"
   being the same as the "expat" issue seemed to imply that CVE-2009-2625
   is about expat... since that's the CVE that was used in the inquiry.
   However, I thought from point 3 that expat and Xerces are distinct
   libraries, which means the CVEs *wouldn't* be the same, because
   CVE-2009-2625 explicitly names Xerces.  Also, for CVE-2009-2625, *none*
   of the primary sources (Fedora, Red Hat, Mandriva, Sun) mention expat
   in their advisories.

6) The only recent CVE assignment that focuses on expat seems to be
   related to the billion laughs attack (CVE-2009-1955).  So does this
   mean that there weren't any other problems related to "infinite loop"
   or "unexpected byte values and recursive parentheses" with memory
   corruption?  If there were, then what are their CVEs?  (Distinct CVEs
   would be needed because corruption/infinite-loop/"unexpected byte
   values" suggest different vuln types than billion-laughs?)

bonus) Is Xerces vulnerable to the billion laughs attack?  If so, was this
   covered in the CERT-FI advisory and does it map to any of the
   previously-provided CVE names?

I'm sure there's even more confusion than this, but it's a good start.

The expat XML parser in the apr_xml_* interface in xml/apr_xml.c in
Apache APR-util before 1.3.7, as used in the mod_dav and mod_dav_svn
modules in the Apache HTTP Server, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted XML document
containing a large number of nested entity references, as demonstrated
by a PROPFIND request, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.

neon before 0.28.6, when expat is used, does not properly detect
recursion during entity expansion, which allows context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption)
via a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity
references, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Summary: Parser crash with specially formatted UTF-8 sequences

Initial Comment:
I have discovered a way to crash libexpat's xml parser with certain specially formatted UTF-8 sequences. All applications that link w/ expat and use it to render user-provided XML files are affected. As far as I see, the issue is not exploitable, just denial of service.

This is the patch that I have come up with, also attached to this email:

+++ lib/xmltok_impl.c 2007-12-21 11:11:42.054417000 -0800
@@ -1745,6 +1745,9 @@
 switch (BYTE_TYPE(enc, ptr)) {
 #define LEAD_CASE(n) \
 case BT_LEAD ## n: \
+ if (end - ptr < n) { \
+   return; \
+ } \
 ptr += n; \
 break;
 LEAD_CASE(2) LEAD_CASE(3) LEAD_CASE(4)

The parser's updatePosition function which keeps track of the current position pointer increments the ptr by {2, 3, 4} to skip past multibyte character ombinations, and this causes ptr in the "while (ptr != end)" loop to jump past the terminating condition, causing the loop to continue reading past 'end' and into out of bounds memory until a crash.

In general this parser does not appear the most robust and could be the source of some security issues.

A fault file is attached. To reproduce, compile examples/outline.c and run against it. This patch may not be 100% complete...

I know what you mean and I had the exact same thoughts. I think at least
for older CPUs doing a "<" comparison might have been slower than doing a
comparison for equality, so I am not sure how that would work out now.
Also, we have to consider that this could modify the logic, with a slight
risk of introducing an error.

Anyway, I think there are other parts of the code (like the encoding
checking) that ensures that pathological situations like the one you found
don't happen. It is also important to observe that the crash seems to
happen only *after* the parser returned with an error, and the code gets
called again to get the error location while the parser is already in an
error state.

Don't forget, Expat is by default installed on most Linux distributions
and it is used by Firefox/Mozilla, so Expat has been given a real good
workout with millions of installations. The bugs you reported are the first
bug reports we received in a long time (except for platform specific build
issues).

Nevertheless, please keep digging, we really want Expat to be resistant to
pathological input.

Thanks for the efforts,

Karl

Yes, I originally had the same patch (while ptr < end) but chose the
latter to keep in line with the rest of the file, sigh.

Now the next question is, there are many while (ptr != end) loops still
left in that file if you search.. some of the look like they could have the
same problem. Should all of them be changed, to be on the paranoid side?
The original construct is just evil and waiting for bugs like this to
happen...

I applied the original fix I had in mind, which I didn't use because I
thought yours might perform better. It is quite simple: replace "while (ptr
!= end)" with "while (ptr < end)".
Seems to work so far. Fixed in xmltok_impl.c rev. 1.15.

What is supposed to happen with the second test case?
It reports an error, but does not crash with xmlwf or outline.
IE reports the same error, so that is probably OK.

Thanks.

Actually rechecking in this area again, I think I found another issue,
which seems to not be covered with the patch I provided :( I am attaching
the new test case.

I haven't found many other issues at this point... I stumbled upon this
one fairly quickly and my above observations were more general than
anything. If I do find more I'll be sure to tell you.

Can reproduce. The problem is that this code can be called *after* an
error has been found (to report line and column number). Therefore it
should not rely on correct byte counts for multibyte characters.

Patch applied in xmltok_impl.c rev. 1.14.

Would you please also report all the other issues you have found?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=652502#c0)  Silvio Cesare    2010-11-12 03:41:33 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  libtlen contains an old embedded version of the expat xml parsing library. Code inspection shows this embedded copy is vulnerable to [CVE-2009-3720](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3720) and possibly other issues.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  Version: 0 Release: 0.9.20060309.fc12  Additional info:  Ideally, the best solution is to link in the system expat library and not use the embedded copy. This would help prevent these types of security issues from reoccuring.  I have marked this issue as a security issue due to the fact that a CVE was assigned to expat. I have not investigated how this vulnerability would be triggered by libtlen.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=652502#c1)  Dominik 'Rathann' Mierzejewski    2010-11-14 01:59:51 UTC  ``` Should be fixed in 0-0.10.20060309 across the board:  <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtlen-0-0.10.20060309.fc14>  <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtlen-0-0.10.20060309.fc13>  <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtlen-0-0.10.20060309.fc12>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=652502#c2)  Fedora Update System    2010-11-15 14:05:27 UTC  ``` libtlen-0-0.10.20060309.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtlen-0-0.10.20060309.fc12>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=652502#c3)  Fedora Update System    2010-11-15 14:05:46 UTC  ``` libtlen-0-0.10.20060309.fc14 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 14. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtlen-0-0.10.20060309.fc14>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=652502#c4)  Fedora Update System    2010-11-15 14:05:52 UTC  ``` libtlen-0-0.10.20060309.fc13 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 13. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/libtlen-0-0.10.20060309.fc13>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=652502#c5)  Fedora Update System    2010-11-15 22:14:57 UTC  ``` libtlen-0-0.10.20060309.fc14 has been pushed to the Fedora 14 testing repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
