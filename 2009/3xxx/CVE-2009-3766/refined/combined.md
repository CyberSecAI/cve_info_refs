# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

For posterity:
- wget got CVE-2009-3490
- mutt CVE-2009-2408-like issue got CVE-2009-3765
- mutt missing name checks in pre-1.5.19 got CVE-2009-3766 (only 1.5.16
  is mentioned in the CVE description atm)
- openldap got CVE-2009-3767

Hi!

CVE-2009-2408-like problems were identified and fixed in some more
applications...

wget - bunch of relevant links are available in here:
  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=520454>

mutt, when using OpenSSL, fixed via:
  [http://dev.mutt.org/trac/changeset/6016:dc09812e63a3/mutt_ssl.c](http://dev.mutt.org/trac/changeset/6016%3Adc09812e63a3/mutt_ssl.c)
This only applies to 1.5.19 and later, as no name check was done in
earlier versions when OpenSSL was used for crypto, which is a problem
by itself:
  <http://dev.mutt.org/trac/ticket/3087>

Qt got CVE-2009-2700, earlier versions of KDE use own crypto wrapper
implemented in kdelibs, which is affected too:
  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2009-2702>

OpenLDAP upstream did some changes that addressed this in OpenSSL
wrapping code, along with change related to handling of multiple CNs:
  <http://www.openldap.org/devel/cvsweb.cgi/libraries/libldap/tls_o.c.diff?r1=1.8&r2=1.11&f=h>
They also changed GnuTLS code to check the last CN instead of the first
one, but this was not affected by CVE-2009-2408-like problems:
  <http://www.openldap.org/devel/cvsweb.cgi/libraries/libldap/tls_g.c.diff?r1=1.13&r2=1.14&f=h>
NSS wrapper was re-written too to do name checking itself and not rely
on NSS (CVE-2009-2408 should likely apply here directly and patched
NSS should be sufficient to address null prefix issue in this case;
I've not tested though, do your own tests if you build OpenLDAP with
NSS):
  <http://www.openldap.org/devel/cvsweb.cgi/libraries/libldap/tls_m.c.diff?r1=1.8&r2=1.11&f=h>
