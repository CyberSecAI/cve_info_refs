```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses the "register_globals = on" PHP setting which allows an attacker to directly manipulate variables through HTTP requests.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Authentication bypass. The application fails to properly validate authentication due to the usage of `register_globals`.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.
- Attack vectors: By sending a crafted HTTP GET request with a `login_ok` parameter set to 1, an attacker can bypass the login mechanism.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, and the target application must have the vulnerable `register_globals = on` setting enabled.
