{
  "cve_id": "CVE-2009-3558",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation within the `posix_mkfifo()` function in PHP. Specifically, the `open_basedir` restriction, intended to limit file system access, is bypassed by this function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Open_basedir bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to create named pipes in the filesystem outside of the `open_basedir` restrictions configured in PHP. This could lead to unauthorized file system access, potentially exposing sensitive information or facilitating further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By exploiting the `posix_mkfifo()` function in PHP to create a named pipe in an arbitrary location on the filesystem. A attacker can bypass open\_basedir restriction"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute PHP code on a system with this vulnerability. This could be through a web application, command-line execution, or any other means of running PHP code on the target system."
