- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `database.php` script in efront version 3.5.4 includes the `adodb/adodb.inc.php` file based on a user-supplied `$path` parameter without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of the `$path` parameter in the `database.php` script.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server into the vulnerable application, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP request to the `database.php` script with a malicious URL provided as the `path` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable efront installation and have a malicious file hosted on a server accessible by the vulnerable application.
