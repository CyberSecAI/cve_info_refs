Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3252

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `news.php` file of Rock Band CMS version 0.10. Specifically, the script directly uses user-supplied input from the `year` and `id` GET parameters in SQL queries without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL code into the `year` and `id` parameters of the `news.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could exploit the SQL injection to read sensitive information from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other private data.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
- **Full Compromise:** In some cases, an attacker could achieve full control of the database server and potentially the web server, depending on the database user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `news.php` script.
- The attacker manipulates the `year` and/or `id` parameters in the URL to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** No authentication or special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, as it is present in the publicly accessible `news.php` file.
- **Knowledge of SQL syntax:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL syntax in order to craft the malicious injection queries.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippets are:
```php
if(isset($_GET['year'])){
    $year = $_GET['year'];
    $smarty->assign('news', $db->getNewsYear($year));
}
```
and
```php
$id = $_GET['id'];
$newsItem = $db->getNewsItem($id);
$smarty->assign('news', $newsItem);
```
The exploit examples from exploit-db.com are:

```
http://site.com/news.php?year=-2004+UNION+SELECT+1,2,3,4--
http://site.com/news.php?id=-1+UNION+SELECT+1,2,3,4--
```
The suggested patch is to sanitize user inputs:
```php
$year = addslashes(mysql_real_escape_string($_GET['year']));
$year = addslashes(mysql_real_escape_string($_GET['id']));
```
This uses `mysql_real_escape_string` function to escape special characters used in SQL and the `addslashes()` function to escape special characters for PHP strings.
