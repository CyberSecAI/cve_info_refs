Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3585

**Vulnerable Software:** Request Tracker (RT) versions 3.0.0 through 3.8.5

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a session fixation issue in RT's session handling code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Session Fixation:** The application doesn't properly regenerate session identifiers after user authentication.
-  An additional, related vulnerability was found that allowed an attacker to perform a similar attack without needing to be on a server in the same domain. This vulnerability could be exploited with HTTP access to the RT server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can obtain and redistribute a valid RT session identifier to an unsuspecting user before they log in. When the user logs in with that session ID, the attacker gains control of the user's session, allowing them to perform actions as that user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker on a server in the same domain (e.g., attacker on `example.com` when RT is on `rt.example.com`)
- An attacker with HTTP access to the RT server

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to operate a server within the same domain as the target RT installation, or
- HTTP access to the RT server.
- Ability to manipulate network traffic or otherwise force a user to use a session ID controlled by the attacker.

**Mitigation:**
- Applying the provided patches to the corresponding versions of RT.
- Clearing the mason cache after applying the patch.
- Restarting the webserver.
- Upgrading to RT 3.8.6 or later.
- If you are using RT's `$WebExternalAuth` configuration variable, you are NOT vulnerable to the attack, but should still apply the patch.
- If you are using the RT extension `RT-Authen-ExternalAuth`, you ARE vulnerable to this issue and MUST apply the patch.

**Additional Notes:**
- RT 3.8.6 and later are not vulnerable to this issue.
- The vendor released patches for various versions of RT 3 to address the vulnerability.
- The vendor was contacted by a customer to report the issue.
- The vulnerability was discovered in late September 2009.
- The patches were released in November 2009.
- The vendor credited Mikal Gule and the University of Oslo and Thomas Goetz for reporting the issue.
