How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [Rt-announce] SECURITY - Session Fixation Vulnerability in RT 3.0.0-3.8.5

```
In late September, a customer contacted us to report a session fixation
vulnerability in RT 3.8.5 and all earlier versions back to and including
RT 3.0.0.  Over the course of the past month, we've worked to develop
and release a version of RT not vulnerable to this issue as well as a
"hot patch" to earlier versions of RT which eliminates the vulnerability
with minimal code changes.  RT 3.8.6, released on October 19th, is _not_
vulnerable.

We have been assigned CVE number CVE-2009-3585 for this issue.

This issue could allow a malicious attacker who can operate a server in
the same domain (example.com where RT is rt.example.com) to obtain and
redistribute an RT session identifier to an unsuspecting user before
they log into RT.  When that user logs in, the attacker would then be
able to hijack the user's session.

As part of an internal audit of the session handling code, we found and
fixed an additional, related vulnerability which could allow an attacker
with HTTP access to the RT server to construct a similar attack without
the need for a server within the same domain.

If you are using RT's $WebExternalAuth configuration variable, you are
not vulnerable to this issue (but should still apply this patch).
If you are using the RT extension "RT-Authen-ExternalAuth", you must apply
this patch. RT-Authen-ExternalAuth does NOT protect you from this
vulnerability.

I have attached six patches which should cover all vulnerable versions
of RT 3.  RT 3.6.10 will be released later today and will include a
version of this patch.  As mentioned before, RT 3.8.6 is _not_ vulnerable.

The SHA1s of patches are:

 $ patch -p1 < /path/to/RT-3.0.7-3.6.1-session_fixation.v3.patch

RT 3.6.2-3.6.3

 $ cd /opt/rt3/share
 $ patch -p1 < RT-3.6.2-3.6.3-session_fixation.v3.patch

RT 3.6.4-3.6.9

 $ cd /opt/rt3/share
 $ patch -p1 < RT-3.6.4-3.6.9-session_fixation.v2.patch

RT 3.8.0-3.8.5

 $ cd /opt/rt3/share
 $ patch -p1 < /path/to/RT-3.8-session_fixation.patch

You should then clear your mason cache. If your RT is installed in
/opt/rt3, you would use this command:

 $ rm -rf /opt/rt3/var/mason_data/obj/*

and restart your webserver, this is often accomplished with

 $ /etc/init.d/httpd restart
   (or)
 $ /etc/init.d/apache restart

I apologize for any inconvenience that this issue may have caused you.
We go to great lengths to make sure that RT is robust and secure, but,
as with any software, occasionally we do find defects.  We do our best
to deal with them quickly and responsibly.

I'd like to thank Mikal Gule and the University of Oslo for bringing
this issue to our attention and working with us to triage it and test
the patches included below.  I'd also like to thank Thomas Goetz, who
also brought a variant of this issue to our attention.

If you require assistance evaluating whether your RT deployment is
vulnerable to this issue or deploying the patch, please don't hesitate to
contact us at [sales at bestpractical.com.](http://lists.bestpractical.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rt-announce)  While we're not able to provide
commercial support without charge, we'll make every effort to provide
help for this issue as quickly and as inexpensively as possible.

Best,

Jesse Vincent

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hash: SHA1
In late September, a customer contacted us to report a session fixation
vulnerability in RT 3.8.5 and all earlier versions back to and including
RT 3.0.0.  Over the course of the past month, we've worked to develop
and release a version of RT not vulnerable to this issue as well as a
"hot patch" to earlier versions of RT which eliminates the vulnerability
with minimal code changes.  RT 3.8.6, released on October 19th, is _not_
vulnerable.
We have been assigned CVE number CVE-2009-3585 for this issue.
This issue could allow a malicious attacker who can operate a server in
the same domain (example.com where RT is rt.example.com) to obtain and
redistribute an RT session identifier to an unsuspecting user before
they log into RT.  When that user logs in, the attacker would then be
able to hijack the user's session.
As part of an internal audit of the session handling code, we found and
fixed an additional, related vulnerability which could allow an attacker
with HTTP access to the RT server to construct a similar attack without
the need for a server within the same domain.
If you are using an external auth source (such as apache) you are
not vulnerable to this attack.  This only applies to RT's built-in
$WebExternalAuth setting.  RT-Authen-ExternalAuth does not protect you
from this attack.
I have attached six patches which should cover all vulnerable versions
of RT 3.  RT 3.6.10 will be released later today and will include a
version of this patch.  As mentioned before, RT 3.8.6 is _not_ vulnerable.
The SHA1s of patches are:
38e0a8ce3480807a5dd6cc4da0eb51183382cddd  RT-3.0.0-session_fixation.v3.patch

$ cd /opt/rt3/share
$ patch -p1 < /path/to/RT-3.0.0-session_fixation.v3.patch
RT 3.0.1-3.0.6
$ cd /opt/rt3/share
$ patch -p1 < /path/to/RT-3.0.1-3.0.6-session_fixation.v3.patch
RT 3.0.7-3.6.1
$ cd /opt/rt3/share
$ patch -p1 < /path/to/RT-3.0.7-3.6.1-session_fixation.v3.patch
RT 3.6.2-3.6.3
$ cd /opt/rt3/share
$ patch -p1 < RT-3.6.2-3.6.3-session_fixation.v3.patch
RT 3.6.4-3.6.9
$ cd /opt/rt3/share
$ patch -p1 < RT-3.6.4-3.6.9-session_fixation.v2.patch
RT 3.8.0-3.8.5
$ cd /opt/rt3/share
$ patch -p1 < /path/to/RT-3.8-session_fixation.patch
You should then clear your mason cache. If your RT is installed in /opt/rt3, you
would use this command:
$ rm -rf /opt/rt3/var/mason_data/obj/*
and restart your webserver, this is often accomplished with
$ /etc/init.d/httpd restart
(or)
$ /etc/init.d/apache restart
I apologize for any inconvenience that this issue may have caused you.
We go to great lengths to make sure that RT is robust and secure, but,
as with any software, occasionally we do find defects.  We do our best
to deal with them quickly and responsibly.
I'd like to thank Mikal Gule and the University of Oslo for bringing
this issue to our attention and working with us to triage it and test
the patches included below.  I'd also like to thank Thomas Goetz, who
also brought a variant of this issue to our attention.
If you require assistance evaluating whether your RT deployment is
vulnerable to this issue or deploying the patch, please don't hesitate to
contact us at sales@bestpractical.com.  While we're not able to provide
commercial support without charge, we'll make every effort to provide
help for this issue as quickly and as inexpensively as possible.
Best,
Jesse Vincent
