  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-3673",
      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer improperly accessing an object that is either uninitialized or deleted.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Uninitialized memory corruption"
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain the same user rights as the logged-on user, and potentially complete control of the system if the user has administrative privileges.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a specially crafted web page that, when viewed with Internet Explorer, triggers the vulnerability.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage and convince the victim to visit the page using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer."
