== 1.6.4 Gob Bluth \* Increase REQUEST\_PATH to 2048 symbols [X2rdas] \* Fix warning in logger [tenderlove] \* Add :timeout option for Rack::Server.new [sugitak] \* When restarting, exit on a next tick so we can send response back to a client [rsamoilov] \* Check for empty PID files [z1dane] \* Update Event Machine version to 1.0.4, Ruby 2.2.0 fix [freemanoid]
== 1.6.3 Protein Powder \* Add HTTP 422 status code [rajcybage] \* Add warning about EM reactor still running when stopping. \* Remove version number from "Server" HTTP header. [benbasson] \* Adding `--ssl-disable-verify` to allow disabling of client cert requests when SSL enabled [brucek] \* Ensure Tempfiles created by a large request are closed and deleted. [Tonkpils]
== 1.6.2 Doc Brown \* No longer replace response's body on HEAD request. Ensuring body.close will be called. \* Remove `---ssl-verify` option as EventMachine doesn't verify the certificate. \* Fix env['rack.peer\_cert'] to return SSL certifcate.
== 1.6.1 Death Proof \* Regression: Default logger to STDOUT when using outside of CLI. \* Regression: Downgrade Rack required version back to 1.0 to work w/ prior Rails versions.
== 1.6.0 Greek Yogurt \* Accept absolute URL in request line, eg.: 'GET http://site.com/he/lo HTTP/1.1'. \* HEAD request no longer return a body in the response. \* No longer stop EventMachine's reactor loop unless it was started by Thin. \* Make request env keys upcasing locale-agnostic. \* Use Ruby's `Logger` for logging. [Akshay Moghe]. The logger can now be set using `Thin::Logging.logger=`. Tracing of request is handled by a second logger, `Thin::Logging.trace\_logger=`. \* Add --threadpool-size option to configure EM's thread pool size (default: 20). \* Pipelining is no longer supported.

 Processes are allowed a chance to shut down gracefully when receiving SIGTERM (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGTERM).
 On Heroku, when shutting down a process, we send a SIGTERM followed 10 seconds later with a SIGKILL, similar to the behavior of the init daemon on most Unix systems. This patch will allow Heroku apps to shut down gracefully when they need to be terminated / moved.
== 1.2.11 Bat-Shit Crazy \* Fix pure Ruby gem to not include binary.
== 1.2.10 I'm dumb (BAD RELEASE, DON'T USE) \* I really am (bad release fix)
== 1.2.9 Black Keys Extra Plus Wow (BAD RELEASE, DON'T USE) \* Improve fat binary loading.
== 1.2.8 Black Keys \* Allow the connection to remain open for 1xx statuses [timshadel]
 Both the 100 and 101 status codes require that the connection to the server remain open. The 100 status code is used to tell the client that the server is still receiving its request, and will continue to read request input on the connection. The 101 status code is used to upgrade the existing connection to another protocol, and specifically is NOT used to upgrade a separate connection. Therefore, the connection must remain open after this response in order to facilitate that.
 \* Accept IE7 badly encoded URL (eg.: %uEEEE) \* Fix gemspec to work w/ Bundler [smparkes] \* Add SSL support [tmm1] \* Catch Errno::EPERM in Process.running? [Tony Kemp] On some systems (e.g. OpenBSD) you receive an EPERM exception if you try to Process.getpgid on a process you do not own (even if you are root). But it does mean that the process exists, so return true. \* Fix Rails version check that select which Rack adapter to use. Was using CGI adapter in Rails 3. \* Ignore SIGHUP when no restart block is given \* Add SSL options to thin command line tool [goldmann]
 --ssl Enables SSL --ssl-key-file PATH Path to private key --ssl-cert-file PATH Path to certificate --ssl-verify Enables SSL certificate verification
 \* Expose peer SSL certificate in env (rack.peer\_cert) [fd] \* Adjusting unix socket permissions to be more open [mbj]
== 1.2.7 No Hup \* Support multiple Ruby version (fat binaries under windows) \* Do not trap unsupported HUP signal on Windows
== 1.2.6 Crazy Delicious \* Make work with Rails 3 out-of-the-box. \* Auto-detect and load config.ru files on start. Makes Rails 3 work. \* Fix signals being ignored under 1.9 when daemonized.
== 1.2.5 This Is Not A Web Server \* Add rolling restart support (--onebyone option) [sikachu] \* Force external\_encoding of request's body to ASCII\_8BIT [jeremyz] \* Ensure Rack base API is used in Rails adapter only if version >= 2.3.2 [#111 state:resolved]

== 0.8.0 Dodgy Dentist release \* [bug] Fix server crash when header too large. \* Add --require (-r) option to require a library, before executing your script. \* Rename --rackup short option to -R, warn and load as rackup when file ends with .ru. \* List supported adapters in command usage. \* Add file adapter to built-in adapter, serve static files in current directory. \* Allow disabling signal handling in Server with :signals => false \* Make Server.new arguments more flexible, can now specify any of host, port, app or hash options. \* Add --backend option to specified which backend to use, closes #55 \* [bug] Serve static file only on GET and HEAD requests in Rails adapter, fixes #58 \* Add threaded option to run server in threaded mode, calling the application in a thread allowing for concurrency in the Rack adapter, closes #46 \* Guess which adapter to use from directory (chdir option) or use specified one in 'adapter' option, re #47.
== 0.7.1 Fancy Pants release \* Clean stale PID files when starting as daemon, fixes #53 [Chu Yeow] \* Require EventMachine 0.11.0 for UNIX domain sockets. Until it's released, install from: gem install eventmachine --source http://code.macournoyer.com \* Ruby 1.8.5 compatibility, closes #49 [Wincent Colaiuta] \* Move all EventMachine stuff out of Server, you can now create a Thin Backend that does not depend on EventMachine. \* Rename Connector to Backend.

== 0.6.4 Sexy Lobster release \* Fix error when stopping server on UNIX domain socket, fixes #42 \* Rescue errors in Connection#get\_peername more gracefully, setting REMOTE\_ADDR to nil, fixes #43
== 0.6.3 Ninja Cookie release \* Add tasks for Vlad the Deployer in example/vlad.rake [cnantais] \* Add Ramaze Rackup config file in example dir [tmm1] Use like this from you Ramaze app dir:
 thin start -r /path/to/thin/example/ramaze.ru
 \* Add the --rackup option to load a Rack config file instead of the Rails adapter. So you can use any framework with the thin script and start cluster and stuff like that. A Rack config file is one that is usable through the rackup command and looks like this:
 use Rack::CommonLogger run MyCrazyRackAdapter.new(:uterly, 'cool')
 Then use it with thin like this:
 thin start --rackup config.ru
 \* thin config --chrdir ... -C thin/yml do not change current directory anymore, fixes #33. \* Add a better sample god config file in example/thin.god that loads all info from config files in /etc/thin.

 sudo thin install /etc/thin
 This will install the boot script under /etc/init.d/thin. Then copy your config files to /etc/thin. Works only under Linux. \* Set process name to 'thin server (0.0.0.0:3000)' when running as a daemon, closes #32. \* Make sure chdir option from config file is used when present. \* Raise an error when starting a server as a daemon and pid file already exist, fixes #27.
== 0.6.2 Rambo release \* Server now let current connections finish before stopping, fixes #18 \* Fix uploading hanging bug when body is moved to a tempfile, also delete the tempfile properly upon completion, fixes #25 \* 'thin restart' now sends HUP signals rather then stopping & starting, closes #17 \* HUP signal now launches a new process with the same options. \* Add PID and more info from the last request to the Stats adapter mostly taken from Rack::ShowException. \* pid and log files in cluster are no longer required to be relative to the app directory (chdir option), fixes #24 \* Revert to using #each when building response headers under Ruby 1.8, solves an issue w/ Camping adapter, fixes #22 \* Restructure thin script options in 3 sections: server, daemon and cluster \* Add --only (-o) option to control only one server of a cluster. \* Stylize stats page and make the url configurable from the thin script. \* Raise error if attempting to use unix sockets on windows. \* Add example config files for http://www.tildeslash.com/monit usage. Include the example file using "include /path/to/thin/monit/file" in your monitrc file. The group settings let you do this to manage your clusters:
 sudo monit -g blog restart all
 There are examples of thin listening on sockets and thin listening on unix sockets.
== 0.6.1 Cheesecake release \* Remove socket file when server stops. \* Set back cluster to use 'thin' command to launch servers.
== 0.6.0 Big Pony release \* Add support for connection through UNIX domain socket. Use the --socket (-S) option w/ the thin script to configure the socket filename. Nginx support binding to a UNIX socket like this:
 upstream backend { server unix:/tmp/thin.0.sock; server unix:/tmp/thin.1.sock; server unix:/tmp/thin.2.sock; }
 Start your servers like this:
 thin start -s3 -S/tmp/thin.sock
 \* Remove Server#listen! method. Use Server#start instead. \* Server can now yield a Rack::Builder to allow building an app in one call:
 Server.start '0.0.0.0', 3000 do use Rack::CommonLogger use Rack::ShowExceptions map "/lobster" do use Rack::Lint run Rack::Lobster.new end end
 \* Add a very basic stats page through Stats adapter, load w/ --stats and browse to /stats. \* Add --trace (-V) option to trace request/response and get backtrace w/out all Ruby debug stuff. \* Add --config (-C) option to load options from a config file in thin script [Matt Todd]. \* Alter response headers to output directly to a string. \* Improve specs stability. \* Move request body to a Tempfile if too big (> 112 KB) \* Remove useless check for max header size in Request (already done in the parser)
== 0.5.4 Flying Mustard release \* Don't read the full body, use direct streaming when sending response. See: Response#each As a result, the Content-Length can not be calculated anymore. You have to do set this in your adapter. All frameworks do it anyway. It improve memory usage and boost speed for low concurrency.

Subject: CVE request(?): Thin: Client IP spoofing

Hey,

we've stumbled upon a changelog entry in Thin [1], a ruby http server:

>  * Fix Remote address spoofing vulnerability in
> Connection#remote_address [Alexey Borzenkov]

Thin uses the X-Forwarded-For header (if it is provided) to determine
the client's IP address. That could be used to facilitate spoofing.

This is the commit:
<http://github.com/macournoyer/thin/commit/7bd027914c5ffd36bb408ef47dc749de3b6e063a>

Not sure if it warrants a CVE, if it does, please assign one.

Thanks,
Alex
