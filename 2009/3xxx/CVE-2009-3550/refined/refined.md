Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3550:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference exists within the DCERPC/NT dissector in Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. This occurs when the program attempts to access a memory location through a pointer that does not point to a valid memory address (i.e., it's NULL).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation leads to a crash of the Wireshark application. This could lead to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by analyzing a malformed packet trace file containing specially crafted DCERPC/NT traffic or by capturing such traffic. This means the attacker can either provide a malicious capture file or introduce malicious traffic that will be captured by the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft network packets containing malformed DCERPC/NT data, or to create a malformed packet capture file containing such data. They need to convince the user to open such a file or to capture such traffic using Wireshark. The attacker doesn't need access to the system running Wireshark.
