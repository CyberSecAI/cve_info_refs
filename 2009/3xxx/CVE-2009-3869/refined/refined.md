Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-3869:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `setDiffICM` function within the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `setDiffICM` function lacks proper bounds checking on its input parameters, leading to a stack buffer overflow if a crafted argument is supplied.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `setDiffICM` function in the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) in Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system, gaining control of the system.
*   **Privilege escalation:** The attacker gains privileges equivalent to that of the user running the affected application.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network connections (e.g., by visiting a webpage with a malicious Java applet) without requiring any authentication.
*   **Malicious Java applet:** An attacker could craft a malicious Java applet that includes a crafted argument to the `setDiffICM` function, triggering the overflow when the applet is loaded in a browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to execute a malicious java applet, either by hosting it on a web page or by social engineering tactics to get it executed.
*   The attacker must be able to craft a specific argument that will trigger the overflow.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Java: JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 22, JDK and JRE 6 before Update 17, SDK and JRE 1.3.x before 1.3.1\_27, and SDK and JRE 1.4.x before 1.4.2\_24.
*   The vulnerability is assigned Bug Id 6872357 by Sun/Oracle.

In summary, CVE-2009-3869 describes a critical stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java AWT library, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. Attackers can remotely exploit the issue via a specially crafted Java applet.
