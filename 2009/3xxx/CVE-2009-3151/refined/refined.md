```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of the 'fileName' parameter in the downloadFile.php script. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file path, leading to arbitrary file access.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Disclosure (LFD) due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to information leakage, including configuration files and source code. In this specific example, the attacker is able to read the configuration file by passing '../config.php' as the fileName.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the 'downloadFile.php' script, providing a manipulated 'fileName' parameter that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., '../').",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges on the target server are needed."
