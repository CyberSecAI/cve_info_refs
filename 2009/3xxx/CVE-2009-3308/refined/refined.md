Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2009-3308:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `show-cat.php` script of FanUpdate 2.2.1. Specifically, the `$listingid` variable is directly used in an SQL query without proper validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The unsanitized `$listingid` variable allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive information stored in the database, including user credentials, application settings, and other data.
*   **Database Manipulation:** Beyond reading data, the attacker could modify or delete data within the database, leading to application malfunction or data corruption.
*   **Full Control:** By crafting specific SQL queries, an attacker might be able to gain complete control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `listingid` parameter in an HTTP GET request to the `show-cat.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious queries and exploit the injection vulnerability.
*   **No authentication:** No authentication is mentioned as needed for this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet within `show-cat.php` is:
    ```php
    if (!isset($listingid)) { exit; }
    
    require_once('blog-config.php');
    require_once('functions.php');
    
    $fu =& FanUpdate::instance();
    $fu->addOptFromDb();
    
    $query = "SELECT * FROM ".$fu->getOpt('catoptions_table')." WHERE cat_id=$listingid LIMIT 1";
    ```
    The `$listingid` variable is used directly without sanitization in the SQL query.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) shows a URL that injects SQL code:
    `http://website/script/show-cat.php?listingid=nuLL/*pwned*/uNiOn+aLL+seLeCt+0,0,coNcAt_ws(0x3a,user,0x3a,password),coNcAt_ws(0x3a,user(),0x3a,database(),0x3a,@@datadir,0x3a,version()),0,0+frOm+mysql.user--`
    This PoC demonstrates a technique to extract usernames and passwords, as well as other server and database information from the mysql.user table using a `UNION ALL` injection.

This information is more detailed than the standard CVE description, as it includes specific vulnerable code and a proof of concept exploit.
