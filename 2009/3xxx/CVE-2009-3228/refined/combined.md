2.4 kernels appear to be affected as well, and moreover they appear to
require at least some of these older fixes as well:

<http://marc.info/?l=git-commits-head&m=112002138324380>

Specifically, in net/sched/sch_api.c both tc_fill_qdisc() and
tc_fill_tclass() are affected - the former was fixed in 2.6 in 2005,
the latter is being fixed now.

I'm not sure what this means for CVE.  Should there be another CVE id
for the issues fixed in 2.6 in 2005 (if one was not allocated at the
time), and 2.4 could reference both CVE ids now?

I did not check if any of the affected code is possibly normally only
available to root, but even if so the issue may be relevant on systems
with containers.

This one is here in 2.4 :

   <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.4.37.y.git;a=commitdiff;h=0f3f2328f63c521fe4b435f148687452f98b2349>

Here in 2.4 :

  <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.4.37.y.git;a=commitdiff;h=096ed17f20affc2db0e307658c69b67433992a7a>

in 2.4, was fixed with the other one above from 2005 (0f3f23).

OK, for 2.4, all the issues mentionned here were fixed in 2.4.37.6 and present
up to 2.4.37.5.

In 2.6 now :

  - tc_fill_tclass was fixed in 2.6.31-rc9 (commit 16ebb5e0)
  - neightbl_fill_info, tcf_fill_node, tc_fill_qdisc... in 2.6.13-rc1
    (commit 9ef1d4c7)

OK, thanks Steven.

Thanks Eugene, that's very kind. I have merged all 4 patches and
pushed them to the master repo. I'm not releasing right now because
those vulns are minor and I still have other issues to fix.

## Details

It was discovered that the AX.25 network subsystem did not correctly

check integer signedness in certain setsockopt calls. A local attacker

could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

Ubuntu 9.10 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-2909](/security/CVE-2009-2909))

Jan Beulich discovered that the kernel could leak register contents to

32-bit processes that were switched to 64-bit mode. A local attacker

could run a specially crafted binary to read register values from an

earlier process, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-2910](/security/CVE-2009-2910))

Dave Jones discovered that the gdth SCSI driver did not correctly validate

array indexes in certain ioctl calls. A local attacker could exploit

this to crash the system or gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2009-3080](/security/CVE-2009-3080))

Eric Dumazet and Jiri Pirko discovered that the TC and CLS subsystems

would leak kernel memory via uninitialized structure members. A local

attacker could exploit this to read several bytes of kernel memory,

leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3228](/security/CVE-2009-3228), [CVE-2009-3612](/security/CVE-2009-3612))

Earl Chew discovered race conditions in pipe handling. A local attacker

could exploit anonymous pipes via /proc/\*/fd/ and crash the system or

gain root privileges. ([CVE-2009-3547](/security/CVE-2009-3547))

Dave Jones and Francois Romieu discovered that the r8169 network driver

could be made to leak kernel memory. A remote attacker could send a large

number of jumbo frames until the system memory was exhausted, leading

to a denial of service. Ubuntu 9.10 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3613](/security/CVE-2009-3613)).

Ben Hutchings discovered that the ATI Rage 128 video driver did not

correctly validate initialization states. A local attacker could

make specially crafted ioctl calls to crash the system or gain root

privileges. ([CVE-2009-3620](/security/CVE-2009-3620))

Tomoki Sekiyama discovered that Unix sockets did not correctly verify

namespaces. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a system hang,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-3621](/security/CVE-2009-3621))

J. Bruce Fields discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly use the credential

cache. A local attacker using a mount with AUTH\_NULL authentication

could exploit this to crash the system or gain root privileges. Only

Ubuntu 9.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3623](/security/CVE-2009-3623))

Alexander Zangerl discovered that the kernel keyring did not correctly

reference count. A local attacker could issue a series of specially

crafted keyring calls to crash the system or gain root privileges.

Only Ubuntu 9.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3624](/security/CVE-2009-3624))

David Wagner discovered that KVM did not correctly bounds-check CPUID

entries. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system

or possibly gain elevated privileges. Ubuntu 6.06 and 9.10 were not

affected. ([CVE-2009-3638](/security/CVE-2009-3638))

Avi Kivity discovered that KVM did not correctly check privileges when

accessing debug registers. A local attacker could exploit this to

crash a host system from within a guest system, leading to a denial of

service. Ubuntu 6.06 and 9.10 were not affected. ([CVE-2009-3722](/security/CVE-2009-3722))

Philip Reisner discovered that the connector layer for uvesafb, pohmelfs,

dst, and dm did not correctly check capabilties. A local attacker could

exploit this to crash the system or gain elevated privileges. Ubuntu

6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3725](/security/CVE-2009-3725))

Trond Myklebust discovered that NFSv4 clients did not robustly

verify attributes. A malicious remote NFSv4 server could exploit

this to crash a client or gain root privileges. Ubuntu 9.10 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-3726](/security/CVE-2009-3726))

Robin Getz discovered that NOMMU systems did not correctly validate

NULL pointers in do\_mmap\_pgoff calls. A local attacker could attempt to

allocate large amounts of memory to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 6.06 and 9.10 were affected. ([CVE-2009-3888](/security/CVE-2009-3888))

Joseph Malicki discovered that the MegaRAID SAS driver had

world-writable option files. A local attacker could exploit these

to disrupt the behavior of the controller, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2009-3889](/security/CVE-2009-3889), [CVE-2009-3939](/security/CVE-2009-3939))

Roel Kluin discovered that the Hisax ISDN driver did not correctly

check the size of packets. A remote attacker could send specially

crafted packets to cause a system crash, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2009-4005](/security/CVE-2009-4005))

Lennert Buytenhek discovered that certain 802.11 states were not handled

correctly. A physically-proximate remote attacker could send specially

crafted wireless traffic that would crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 9.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-4026](/security/CVE-2009-4026), [CVE-2009-4027](/security/CVE-2009-4027))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change (except for Ubuntu 6.06)

the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires

you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you

might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to

update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel

version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system

upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

| [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=530490#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-10-26 07:16:09 UTC  ``` Quote from the upstream commit: fs: pipe.c null pointer dereference      This patch fixes a null pointer exception in pipe_rdwr_open() which generates the stack trace:      > Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000028 RIP: >  [<ffffffff802899a5>] pipe_rdwr_open+0x35/0x70 >  [<ffffffff8028125c>] __dentry_open+0x13c/0x230 >  [<ffffffff8028143d>] do_filp_open+0x2d/0x40 >  [<ffffffff802814aa>] do_sys_open+0x5a/0x100 >  [<ffffffff8021faf3>] sysenter_do_call+0x1b/0x67      The failure mode is triggered by an attempt to open an anonymous pipe via /proc/pid/fd/* as exemplified by this script:      ============================================================= while : ; do    { echo y ; sleep 1 ; } | { while read ; do echo z$REPLY; done ; } &    PID=$!    OUT=$(ps -efl | grep 'sleep 1' | grep -v grep |         { read PID REST ; echo $PID; } )    OUT="${OUT%% *}"    DELAY=$((RANDOM * 1000 / 32768))    usleep $((DELAY * 1000 + RANDOM % 1000 ))    echo n > /proc/$OUT/fd/1                 # Trigger defect done =============================================================      Note that the failure window is quite small and I could only reliably reproduce the defect by inserting a small delay in pipe_rdwr_open(). For example:   static int  pipe_rdwr_open(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp)  {        msleep(100);        mutex_lock(&inode->i_mutex);  Although the defect was observed in pipe_rdwr_open(), I think it makes sense to replicate the change through all the pipe_*_open() functions.      The core of the change is to verify that inode->i_pipe has not been released before attempting to manipulate it. If inode->i_pipe is no longer present, return ENOENT to indicate so.      The comment about potentially using atomic_t for i_pipe->readers and i_pipe->writers has also been removed because it is no longer relevant in this context. The inode->i_mutex lock must be used so that inode->i_pipe can be dealt with correctly.  <http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/10/14/184> <http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/10/21/42> <http://git.kernel.org/linus/ad3960243e55320d74195fb85c975e0a8cc4466c>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=530490#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-03 18:21:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2009:1540 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1540.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=530490#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-03 19:12:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1541 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1541.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=530490#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-03 19:33:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1548 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1548.html>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=530490#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-03 22:03:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:1550 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1550.html>   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=530490#c17)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-05 04:56:59 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.30.9-96.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/kernel-2.6.30.9-96.fc11>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=530490#c18)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-05 05:05:36 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.30.9-96.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/kernel-2.6.30.9-96.fc11>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=530490#c19)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-05 05:14:31 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.27.38-170.2.113.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/kernel-2.6.27.38-170.2.113.fc10>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=530490#c20)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-06 00:02:49 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.30.9-96.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Perhaps __nlmsg_put should just always call memset() for the whole
added chunk. It is not like it is critical path in any way, and
avoid any of this possible class of errors.

Doing it in __nlmsg_put would effect a lot of code paths.  I don't
think you can say with certainty that it won't matter, tree wide.

What about things like the netfilter conntrack event monitor?  Doesn't
that emit hundreds of thousands of events per second on a busy
firewall?

I'll apply this to net-2.6, thanks everyone.

I doubt it would make a noticeable performance difference because
the first memset would incur the cache penalty of the write (if any)
and later update of fields would be cached.

Indeed, but it also means your store buffer usage is half as effective.
And when writing a ton of messages that might be important.

Thanks for letting me know.

I'm late on fixes these days. I still have several ones to apply but
need to find time to work on them.

Personally I have no problem referencing an old CVE in a recent
commit if it helps tracking common bugs. And I think we've already
done that in the past.

In general I tend to consider those "bytes leak" bugs with lower
importance, but they need to be fixed anyway since they may eventually
impact some random setup somewhere.

Thanks,
Willy

RHSA-2009:1540 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2009-11-03
Updated:
2009-11-03
# RHSA-2009:1540 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix several security issues, multiple bugs,
and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.1.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* the ADDR\_COMPAT\_LAYOUT and MMAP\_PAGE\_ZERO flags were not cleared when a

setuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to bypass the mmap\_min\_addr protection mechanism and perform a
NULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)

* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local

users in the unconfined\_t domain to map low memory areas even if the
mmap\_min\_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local
exploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in getname() implementations in

numerous network protocol implementations in the Linux kernel. Certain
data structures in these getname() implementations were not initialized
properly before being copied to user-space. These flaws could lead to an
information leak. (CVE-2009-3002, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux

kernel. pci\_unmap\_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
abuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.
(CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the r128 driver in the

Linux kernel. Checks to test if the Concurrent Command Engine state was
initialized were missing in private IOCTL functions. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a local denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2009-3620, Important)

* Kees Cook and Steve Beattie discovered a race condition in the /proc

code in the Linux kernel. This could lead to information in the
"/proc/[pid]/maps" and "/proc/[pid]/smaps" files being leaked to users (who
would otherwise not have access to this information) during ELF loading.
This could help a local attacker bypass the ASLR security feature.
(CVE-2009-2691, Moderate)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the md driver in the Linux

kernel. If the suspend\_lo or suspend\_hi file in "/sys/" is modified when
the disk array is inactive, it could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. By default, only root can write to these two files.
(CVE-2009-2849, Moderate)

* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,

32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. (CVE-2009-2910, Moderate)

* padding data in several core network structures was not initialized

properly before being sent to user-space, possibly leading to information
leaks. (CVE-2009-3228, CVE-2009-3612, Moderate)

* the unix\_stream\_connect() function in the Linux kernel did not check if a

UNIX domain socket was in the shutdown state. This could lead to a
deadlock. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2009-3621, Moderate)

These updated packages also include bug fixes and enhancements. Users are
directed to the Realtime Security Update Release Notes for version 1.1 for
information on these changes, which will be available shortly from:

<http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_MRG/>

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues and add enhancements. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I should have been much more clear about the effects of this bug, and how to test it out.  What you are getting below is expected, but let me explain in more detail.  The fundamental problem that caused us to see this bug is that the HP serial console hardware on this type of machine is buggy.  In particular, it can get into a state where it won't timely drain the TX buffer.  That means that the operating system (in this case, the hypervisor + dom0) is filling up the serial TX buffer with data to send, but the serial hardware isn't picking that up and rendering it out to the IPMI in a timely manner.  Previous to this patch, when the TX buffer got full, the hypervisor would just hang until the buffer emptied.  This was not a good thing to do; we don't want to stop booting the machine just because we encountered buggy serial hardware.  You could tell that the whole machine was hung by the fact that ping and/or ssh into the machine failed.  After this patch, we *still* have the buggy serial hardware, but the machine finishes booting.  That means that the TX buffer fills up, the hardware fails to drain it, but instead of hanging, the hypervisor now just drops serial data.  This means that the machine can finish booting, even though we lose some serial data along the way.  You can tell that it finished booting by ssh'ing or ping'ing the machine, which still should be up.  So, I think that we have proved that the HP serial hardware is still buggy.  Assuming that we can ssh into the machine with the -164.6.1 kernel, even though we don't get all of the serial output, then I think that we've proved that this patch works.  I'm going to flip it back to ON_QA for the time being.  Chris Lalancette   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=524153#c19)  Vivian Bian    2009-11-03 09:24:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=524153#c18))    so the real problem to delay the verify process is the buggy serial console.   with both -164-6.1 kernel and -170 kernel, I could ping the HP host and ssh into it successfully when I got the hang output. So we can say the kernel is still booting at that point , and could boot successfully . Also I did removed the crontab after I ssh into the HP host , and could perform some commands successfully.    now set the status to VERIFIED   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=524153#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-03 19:34:19 UTC  ``` An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

This would be the typical practice.  We weren't tracking kernel bugs at
the function-name level back then, though - we were using more mature (and
more general) advisory descriptions - so I can't be absolutely sure
whether there's a CVE for this or not.

However, a search for "netlink" turned up empty for this type of problem
in that time frame, so we probably don't have a CVE for it yet.

One question, though - <http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/32830/> patches
net/sched/sch_api.c / tc_fill_tclass, but the 2005 patch includes
net/core/neighbour.c, net/sched/cls_api.c, and others.

So we have:

tc_fill_qdisc() - already fixed in 2.6; just fixed in 2.4

  <http://marc.info/?l=git-commits-head&m=112002138324380>
  (not sure of reference for 2.4)

multiple functions e.g. tcf_fill_node() already fixed in 2.6; unknown
status in 2.4.  Includes neightbl_fill_info(), neightbl_fill_param_info(),
and others.

  <http://marc.info/?l=git-commits-head&m=112002138324380>

tc_fill_tclass() - just fixed in 2.6

  <http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/32830/>

So for now, we have:

  CVE-2009-3228 - tc_fill_tclass()

  CVE-2005-4881 - tc_fill_qdisc()  (at least)

Now we have:

  tcf_fill_node(), neightbl_fill_info(), and others from 2005.

Typical practice would be to associate tcf_fill_node() and the others with
CVE-2005-4881, not just have it be with tc_fill_qdisc() - because they
were all disclosed in 2005.  Then the 2.4 fix might only apply to a
portion of CVE-2005-4881.  This could make it difficult to coordinate
low-level patches, but our "(1)" and "(2)" numbering style in the CVE
description could be used at that level if needed.

So, let's go with these two numbers.  I'll fill them out later.  (My head
hurts.)

Oh, and if anybody could give me more precise version information than
"2.4" and "2.6" then that would be appreciated.

- Steve

P.S. I chose the 2005 date in the CVE to help with distinguishing the
problems, but arguably this should have received a 2009, because the 2005
fix was so vague that the security implications weren't (apparently) known
until 2009.

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1548)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local

users in the unconfined\_t domain to map low memory areas even if the
mmap\_min\_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local
exploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the eCryptfs implementation

in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a local
denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2908, Important)

* a flaw was found in the NFSv4 implementation. The kernel would do an

unnecessary permission check after creating a file. This check would
usually fail and leave the file with the permission bits set to random
values. Note: This is a server-side only issue. (CVE-2009-3286, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux

kernel. pci\_unmap\_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
abuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.
(CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in the Linux kernel. Padding data

in several core network structures was not initialized properly before
being sent to user-space. These flaws could lead to information leaks.
(CVE-2009-3228, Moderate)

Bug fixes:

* with network bonding in the "balance-tlb" or "balance-alb" mode, the

primary setting for the primary slave device was lost when said device was
brought down. Bringing the slave back up did not restore the primary
setting. (BZ#517971)

* some faulty serial device hardware caused systems running the kernel-xen

kernel to take a very long time to boot. (BZ#524153)

* a caching bug in nfs\_readdir() may have caused NFS clients to see

duplicate files or not see all files in a directory. (BZ#526960)

* the RHSA-2009:1243 update removed the mpt\_msi\_enable option, preventing

certain scripts from running. This update adds the option back. (BZ#526963)

* an iptables rule with the recent module and a hit count value greater

than the ip\_pkt\_list\_tot parameter (the default is 20), did not have any
effect over packets, as the hit count could not be reached. (BZ#527434)

* a check has been added to the IPv4 code to make sure that rt is not NULL,

to help prevent future bugs in functions that call ip\_append\_data() from
being exploitable. (BZ#527436)

* a kernel panic occurred in certain conditions after reconfiguring a tape

drive's block size. (BZ#528133)

* when using the Linux Virtual Server (LVS) in a master and backup

configuration, and propagating active connections on the master to the
backup, the connection timeout value on the backup was hard-coded to 180
seconds, meaning connection information on the backup was soon lost. This
could prevent the successful failover of connections. The timeout value
can now be set via "ipvsadm --set". (BZ#528645)

* a bug in nfs4\_do\_open\_expired() could have caused the reclaimer thread on

an NFSv4 client to enter an infinite loop. (BZ#529162)

* MSI interrupts may not have been delivered for r8169 based network cards

that have MSI interrupts enabled. This bug only affected certain systems.
(BZ#529366)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
