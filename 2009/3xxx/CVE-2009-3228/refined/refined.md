Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-3228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `tc_fill_tclass()` function in the Linux kernel's traffic control (`tc`) subsystem. This function failed to initialize specific structure members (`tcm__pad1` and `tcm__pad2`) before passing them to user space via netlink messages. This led to an information leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uninitialized Memory:** The primary issue was the use of uninitialized kernel memory. The `tcm__pad1` and `tcm__pad2` fields within the `tcm` structure were not set to a known value before the structure was sent to userspace.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** The lack of initialization resulted in the exposure of potentially sensitive kernel memory contents to a local user. This could lead to a loss of privacy.
*   **Limited Impact:** The leak was limited to a few bytes (3 bytes as initially reported), so the direct impact was relatively low. However, this type of leak could be used as part of a chain of exploits to gain additional information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability could only be exploited by a local user.
*   **Traffic Control Subsystem:** The vulnerability is in the `tc` subsystem, which deals with traffic control. It is assumed the attacker would use the traffic control netlink interface to cause the vulnerable code path to be executed.
*   **Unspecified vectors:** The specific method of triggering the vulnerable code in the `tc_fill_tclass()` function was not clearly defined. However, any local user who can use the traffic control subsystem could trigger it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have a user account on the system where the vulnerable kernel is running.
*   **Traffic Control Access:** The attacker must have the ability to use the traffic control (tc) functionality that triggers the vulnerable code path. This may not be available to all users by default; some operations may require elevated (root) privileges. However, the text also indicates that this may be exploitable in container environments.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Kernels:** The issue affected Linux kernels 2.4.x before 2.4.37.6 and 2.6.x before 2.6.31-rc9.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves explicitly initializing the `tcm__pad1` and `tcm__pad2` members to 0 before sending them to userspace.
*   **Multiple Locations:** The original report also indicated that similar issues existed in `tc_fill_qdisc()` (fixed in 2005) and other functions related to netlink messages (`tcf_fill_node()`, `neightbl_fill_info()`, etc.) which might be related to a different CVE (CVE-2005-4881).
*   **Red Hat:** Red Hat has issued advisories (RHSA-2009:1522, RHSA-2009:1540 and RHSA-2009:1548) to address this vulnerability in their affected products.
*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu also included a fix for this in USN-864-1 along with several other kernel vulnerabilities.

The provided content confirms that CVE-2009-3228 is related to a kernel memory leak due to uninitialized padding bytes in a netlink message sent to user-space via the traffic control subsystem in the Linux Kernel and that the fix addresses the uninitialized fields in the `tc_fill_tclass` function in `net/sched/sch_api.c`
