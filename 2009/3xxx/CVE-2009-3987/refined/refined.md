Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Mozilla's `GeckoActiveXObject` handles exception messages when attempting to instantiate COM objects. Specifically, the error messages differ depending on whether the requested COM object's ProgID (Programmatic Identifier) is registered in the system registry.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** The differing error messages reveal whether a specific COM object is installed on the user's system or not.
-   **Privacy Violation:** This information can be used to build a profile of the user's software environment and track the user across browsing sessions.
-   **Potential for Targeted Exploitation:** Knowing the specific software installed could enable more targeted attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **User Profiling/Tracking:** An attacker can enumerate the list of COM objects installed on a user's system. This creates a profile that can be used to track the user across browsing sessions, even if cookies are disabled.
-   **Fingerprinting:** The profile can be used for more precise user fingerprinting, allowing attackers to identify users uniquely.
-   **Targeted Attacks:** Knowledge of installed software can inform further attacks that target specific vulnerabilities within those applications.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Web Pages:** A malicious website can use JavaScript and the `GeckoActiveXObject` to trigger the vulnerability when a user visits the page.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could exploit an XSS vulnerability to inject malicious JavaScript code that leverages this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be located remotely and needs only to lure the victim to a malicious website or use XSS to inject malicious code.
-   **JavaScript Execution:** The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the user's browser.
-   **Knowledge of ProgIDs:** The attacker needs to have a list of potentially installed COM object ProgIDs to query for.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability is specific to Windows systems because it relates to the COM object registry.
-   The vulnerability was fixed by removing `GeckoActiveXObject` and similar unnecessary globals.
-   The vulnerability was considered low impact.

**Resolution**
The vulnerability was resolved in Firefox 3.0.16, Firefox 3.5.6 and SeaMonkey 2.0.1 by removing the vulnerable code.
