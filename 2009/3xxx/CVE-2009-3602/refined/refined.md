Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3602

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Unbound, a DNS resolver, handles cryptographic signatures on NSEC3 records. Specifically, it fails to properly check these signatures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of NSEC3 record signatures.
- This allows a bypass of the cryptographic protection provided by DNSSEC when using NSEC3.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who can perform DNS spoofing can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker can downgrade secure delegations to insecure status, effectively removing the cryptographic protection of the zone.
- This can then be used in further spoofing attacks to inject malicious DNS data.
- The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the cryptographic protection of zones signed with the NSEC3 variant of DNSSEC.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires the ability to perform DNS spoofing, enabling an attacker to insert malicious DNS responses into the cache of vulnerable DNS resolvers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to perform DNS spoofing.
- This implies the attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and manipulate DNS traffic.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Unbound versions prior to 1.3.4, with older versions back to 1.0.x also being vulnerable.
- The exploit requires an attacker to first carry out an ordinary cache poisoning attack to add bad data to the cache. The vulnerability then allows for the cryptographic protection on NSEC3 signed zones to be bypassed.
