How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-834-1: PostgreSQL vulnerabilities

21 September 2009

PostgreSQL vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [postgresql-8.1](/security/cves?package=postgresql-8.1) -
* [postgresql-8.3](/security/cves?package=postgresql-8.3) -

## Details

It was discovered that PostgreSQL could be made to unload and reload an

already loaded module by using the LOAD command. A remote authenticated

attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. This issue did

not affect Ubuntu 6.06 LTS. ([CVE-2009-3229](/security/CVE-2009-3229))

Due to an incomplete fix for [CVE-2007-6600](/security/CVE-2007-6600), RESET ROLE and RESET SESSION

AUTHORIZATION operations were allowed inside security-definer functions. A

remote authenticated attacker could exploit this to escalate privileges

within PostgreSQL. ([CVE-2009-3230](/security/CVE-2009-3230))

It was discovered that PostgreSQL did not properly perform LDAP

authentication under certain circumstances. When configured to use LDAP

with anonymous binds, a remote attacker could bypass authentication by

supplying an empty password. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 6.06 LTS.

([CVE-2009-3231](/security/CVE-2009-3231))

### Reduce your security exposure

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [postgresql-8.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-8.3)
  -
  [8.3.8-0ubuntu8.04](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-8.3/8.3.8-0ubuntu8.04)

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* [postgresql-8.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-8.1)
  -
  [8.1.18-0ubuntu0.6.06](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/postgresql-8.1/8.1.18-0ubuntu0.6.06)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- php5
php5 has been updated to fix problems with SSL certificate
validation and overflows in the exif and gd modules
(CVE-2009-3291,CVE-2009-3292, CVE-2009-3293, CVE-2009-2687).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- newt
A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way newt used to process
content, to be rendered in text dialog box. Local attacker could issue
a specially-crafted text dialog box rendering request (direct or via
custom application), leading to denial of service (application crash)
or, potentially, to execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running the application (CVE-2009-2905).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- rubygem-actionpack
This update improves the escaping in the helper code of Ruby on
Rails to protect against XSS attacks (CVE-2009-3009) and an
information leak (CVE-2009-3086).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.1
- rubygem-activesupport
This update improves the escaping in the helper code of Ruby on
Rails to protect against XSS attacks (CVE-2009-3009) and an
information leak (CVE-2009-3086).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.1
- java-1\_4\_2-ibm
IBM Java 1.4.2 was updated to SR13 FP1.
It fixes following two security issues:
CVE-2009-2625: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with parsing XML data might allow a remote client to create a
denial-of-service condition on the system that the JRE runs on.
CVE-2008-5349: A vulnerability in how the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) handles certain RSA public keys might cause the JRE to consume
an excessive amount of CPU resources. This might lead to a Denial of
Service (DoS) condition on affected systems. Such keys could be
provided by a remote client of an application.
This issue affects the following security providers:
IBMJCE, IBMPKCS11Impl and IBMJCEFIPS.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11
- postgresql
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in PostgrSQL
- CVE-2009-3229: allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial
of service
- CVE-2009-3230: allows remote authenticated users to gain higher
privileges
- CVE-2009-3231: when using LDAP authentication with anonymous
binds, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an
empty password
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- samba
samba's make\_connection\_snum() handles certain input incorrectly,
which may lead to disclosure of the root directory (CVE-2009-2813).
Additionally an information disclosure vulnerability in mount.cifs
has been fixed (CVE-2009-2948) as well as a DoS condition
(CVE-2009-2906).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- phpMyAdmin
phpMyAdmin has been updated to version 2.11.9.6 to fix a cross-site
scripting (XSS) issue (CVE-2009-3696) and an SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2009-3697).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3, openSUSE 11.0
- viewvc
Update of viewvc to version 1.0.9 fixes a cross-site scripting (XSS)
problem and enhances filtering of illegal characters when displaying
error messages (CVE-2009-3618, CVE-2009-3619).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may

# E.16. Release 8.3.8

> **Release Date:** 2009-09-09

This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.3.7. For
information about new features in the 8.3 major release, see
[Section E.24](release-8-3.html).

## E.16.1. Migration to Version 8.3.8

A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X.
However, if you have any hash indexes on interval columns, you must REINDEX them after updating to 8.3.8. Also, if
you are upgrading from a version earlier than 8.3.5, see the
release notes for 8.3.5.

## E.16.2. Changes

* Fix Windows shared-memory allocation code (Tsutomu
  Yamada, Magnus)

  This bug led to the often-reported "could not reattach to shared memory" error
  message.
* Force WAL segment switch during `pg_start_backup()` (Heikki)

  This avoids corner cases that could render a base backup
  unusable.
* Disallow RESET ROLE and
  RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION inside
  security-definer functions (Tom, Heikki)

  This covers a case that was missed in the previous patch
  that disallowed SET ROLE and
  SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION inside
  security-definer functions. (See CVE-2007-6600)
* Make LOAD of an already-loaded
  loadable module into a no-op (Tom)

  Formerly, LOAD would attempt to
  unload and re-load the module, but this is unsafe and not
  all that useful.
* Disallow empty passwords during LDAP authentication
  (Magnus)
* Fix handling of sub-SELECTs appearing in the arguments
  of an outer-level aggregate function (Tom)
* Fix bugs associated with fetching a whole-row value from
  the output of a Sort or Materialize plan node (Tom)
* Prevent synchronize\_seqscans
  from changing the results of scrollable and WITH HOLD cursors (Tom)
* Revert planner change that disabled partial-index and
  constraint exclusion optimizations when there were more
  than 100 clauses in an AND or OR list (Tom)
* Fix hash calculation for data type interval (Tom)

  This corrects wrong results for hash joins on interval
  values. It also changes the contents of hash indexes on
  interval columns. If you have any such indexes, you must
  REINDEX them after updating.
* Treat `to_char(..., 'TH')`
  as an uppercase ordinal suffix with 'HH'/'HH12'
  (Heikki)

  It was previously handled as 'th' (lowercase).
* Fix overflow for INTERVAL
  'x ms' when x is more than 2 million and integer
  datetimes are in use (Alex Hunsaker)
* Fix calculation of distance between a point and a line
  segment (Tom)

  This led to incorrect results from a number of geometric
  operators.
* Fix money data type to work in
  locales where currency amounts have no fractional digits,
  e.g. Japan (Itagaki Takahiro)
* Fix LIKE for case where pattern
  contains %\_ (Tom)
* Properly round datetime input like 00:12:57.9999999999999999999999999999
  (Tom)
* Fix memory leaks in XML operations (Tom)
* Fix poor choice of page split point in GiST R-tree
  operator classes (Teodor)
* Ensure that a "fast shutdown"
  request will forcibly terminate open sessions, even if a
  "smart shutdown" was already in
  progress (Fujii Masao)
* Avoid performance degradation in bulk inserts into GIN
  indexes when the input values are (nearly) in sorted order
  (Tom)
* Correctly enforce NOT NULL domain constraints in some
  contexts in PL/pgSQL (Tom)
* Fix portability issues in plperl initialization (Andrew
  Dunstan)
* Fix pg\_ctl to not go
  into an infinite loop if postgresql.conf is empty (Jeff Davis)
* Improve pg\_dump's
  efficiency when there are many large objects (Tamas
  Vincze)
* Use SIGUSR1, not SIGQUIT, as the failover signal for
  pg\_standby (Heikki)
* Make pg\_standby's
  maxretries option behave as
  documented (Fujii Masao)
* Make contrib/hstore throw an
  error when a key or value is too long to fit in its data
  structure, rather than silently truncating it (Andrew
  Gierth)
* Fix contrib/xml2's
  `xslt_process()` to properly
  handle the maximum number of parameters (twenty) (Tom)
* Improve robustness of libpq's code to recover from errors
  during COPY FROM STDIN (Tom)
* Avoid including conflicting readline and editline header
  files when both libraries are installed (Zdenek Kotala)
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009l for DST law
  changes in Bangladesh, Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan,
  Argentina/San\_Luis, Cuba, Jordan (historical correction
  only), Mauritius, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Tunisia.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research).
