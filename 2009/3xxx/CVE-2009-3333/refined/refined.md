{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `com_koesubmit` component for Mambo is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The vulnerability exists due to insecure handling of the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter in the `koesubmit.php` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system. This can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, malware injection, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `koesubmit.php` file, including the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter, which specifies the URL of the malicious remote file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a server hosting the malicious code that will be included and executed."
