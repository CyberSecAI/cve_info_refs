/ Changes

```

v1.30 2009.08.19
- fix test t/memleak_bad_handshake.t
v1.29 2009.08.19
- fixed thanks for version 1.28
v1.28 2009.08.19
- fix memleak when SSL handshake failed.
  Thanks richardhundtu[AT]gmail[DOT]com

v1.27 2009.07.24
- changed possible local/utf-8 depended \w in some regex against more
  explicit [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Fixed one regex, where it assumed, that service
  names can't have '-' inside
- fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=48131
  where eli[AT]dvns[DOT]com reported warnings when perl -w was used.
  While there made it more aware of errors in Net::ssl_write_all (return
  undef not 0 in generic_write)
v1.26 2009.07.03
- SECURITY BUGFIX!
  fix Bug in verify_hostname_of_cert where it matched only the prefix for
  the hostname when no wildcard was given, e.g. www.example.org matched
  against a certificate with name www.exam in it
  Thanks to MLEHMANN for reporting

v1.25 2009.07.02
- t/nonblock.t: increase number of bytes written to fix bug with OS X 10.5
  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47240

v1.24 2009.04.01
- add verify hostname scheme ftp, same as http
- renew test certificates again (root CA expired, now valid for 10 years)

v1.23 2009.02.23
- if neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path are known (e.g not given and the
  default values have no existing file|path) disable checking of
  certificates, but carp about the problem
- new test certificates, the old ones expired and caused tests to fail

v1.22 2009.01.24
- Net::SSLeay stores verify callbacks inside hash and never clears them, so
  set verify callback to NULL in destroy of context

v1.21 2009.01.22
- auto verification of name in certificate created circular reference between
  SSL and CTX object with the verify_callback, which caused the objects to be
  destroyed only at program end. Fix it be no longer access $self from inside
  the callback.
  Thanks to odenbach[AT]uni-paderborn[DOT]de for reporting

v1.20 2009.01.15
- only changes on test suite to make it ready for win32
  (tested with strawberry perl 5.8.8)

v1.19 2008.12.31
- fix verifycn_name autodetection from PeerAddr/PeerHost

v1.18 2008.11.17
- fixed typo in argument: wildcars_in_cn -> wildcards_in_cn
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40997
  thanks to ludwig[DOT]nussel[AT]suse[DOT]de for reporting

v1.17 2008.10.13
- no code changes, publish v.16_3 as v.17 because it looks better
  than v.16
- document win32 behavior regarding non-blocking and timeouts

v1.16_3   2008.09.25
- fix t/nonblock.t with workaround for problems with
  IO::Socket::INET on some systems (Mac,5.6.2) where it cannot do
  nonblocking connect and leaves socket blocked.
- make some tests less verbose by fixing diag in t/testlib.t
  (send output to STDOUT not STDERR and prefix with '#')

v1.16_2   2008.09.24
- work around Bug in IO::Socket::INET6 on BSD systems
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39550
  by setting Domain based on PeerAddr
  Thanks to srezic for report and support
- remove tests of recv/send from t/core.t. Might badly interact
  with SSL handshake and cause crashes as seen on OS X 10.4

v1.16_1   2008.09.19
- better support for IPv6:
  - IPv6 is enabled by default if IO::Socket::INET6 is available
  - t/inet6.t for basic tests

v1.16    2008.09.19
- change code for SSL_check_crl to use X509_STORE_set_flags instead of
  X509_STORE_CTX_set_flags based on bug report from
  <tjtoocool[AT]phreaker[DOT]net >
- change opened() to report -1 if the IO::Handle is open, but the
  SSL connection failed, needed with HTTP::Daemon::SSL which will send
  an error mssage over the unencrypted socket

v1.15
- change internal behavior when SSL handshake failed (like when verify
  callback returned an error) in the hope to fix spurios errors in
  t/auto_verify_hostname.t

v1.14
- added support for verification of hostname from certificate
  including subjectAltNames, support for IDN etc based on patch and
  input from christopher[AT]odenbachs[DOT]de and
  achim[AT]grolmsnet[DOT]de.
  It is also possible to get more information from peer_certificate
  based on this patch. See documentation for peer_certificate and
  verify_hostname
- automatic verification of hostnames with SSL_verifycn_scheme and
  SSL_verifycn_name
- global setting of default context options like SSL_verifycn_scheme,
  SSL_verify_mode with set_ctx_defaults
- fix import of inet4,inet6 which got broken within 1.13_X.
  Thanks to <at[AT]altlinux[DOT]ru> for bugreport and patch
- clarified and enhanced debugging supppport based on bugreport
  http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=32960
- put information into README regarding the supported and recommanded
  version of Net::SSLeay

v1.13
- removed CLONE_SKIP which was added in 1.03 because this breaks
  windows forking. Handled threads/windows forking better by making
  sure that CTX from Net::SSLeay gets not freed multiple times from
  different threads after cloning/forking
- removed setting LocalPort to 0 in tests, instead leave it undef
  if a random port should be allocated. This should fix build problems
  with 5.6.1. Thanks to <andrew[DOT]benham[AT]thus[DOT]net>

v1.12
- treat timeouts of 0 for accept_SSL and connect_SSL like no timeout,
  like IO::Socket does.

v1.11
- fixed errors in accept_SSL which would work when called from start_SSL
  but not from accept

v1.10
- start_SSL, accept_SSL and connect_SSL have argument for Timeout
  so that the SSL handshake will not block forever. Only used if the
  socket is blocking. If not set the Timeout value from the underlying
  IO::Socket is used

v1.09
- new method stop_SSL as opposite of start_SSL based on a idea
  of Bron Gondwana <brong[AT]fastmail[DOT]fm>
  To support this method the SSL_shutdown handling had to be
  fixed, e.g. in close a proper unidirectional shutdown
  should be done while in stop_SSL a bidirectional shutdown
- try to make it clearer that thread support is buggy

v1.08
- make sure that Scalar::Util has support for dualvar
  (Makefile.PL,SSL.pm) because the perl-only version has
  has no dualvar

v1.07
- fix t/nonblock.t on systems which have by default a larger
  socket buffer. Set SO_SNDBUF explicitly with setsockopt
  to force smaller writes on the socket

v1.06
- instead of setting undef args to '' in configure_SSL drop
  them. This makes Net::SMTP::SSL working again because it
  does not give LocalPort of '' to IO::Socket::INET any more

v1.05
- make session cache working even if the IO::Socket::SSL object
  was not created with IO::Socket::SSL->new but with
  IO::Socket::SSL->start_SSL on an established socket

v1.04
- added way to create SSL object with predefined session
  cache, thus making it possible to share the cache between
  objects even if the rest of the context is not shared
  key SSL_session_cache
  Note that the arguments of IO::Socket::SSL::SessionCache::new
  changed (but you should never have used this class directly
  because it's internal to IO::Socket::SSL)

v1.03
- add CLONE_SKIP as proposed by
  Jarrod Johnson jbjohnso at us dot ibm dot com

v1.02
- added some info to BUGS and to BUGS section of pod
- added TELL and BINMODE to IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_HANDLE, even
  if they do nothing useful.
- all tests allocate now the ports dynamically, so there should
  be no longer a conflict with open ports on the system where
  the tests run

v1.01
- work around Bug in Net::HTTPS where it defines sub blocking
  as {}, e.g. force scalar context when calling sub blocking
  (in IO::Socket::SSL::write)
  see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=383106

v1.0
- fix depreciated and practically undocumented function
  get_peer_certificate so that LWP Net::HTTPS works again
- set arg 'Blocking' while calling SUPER::configure only
  if it was set by the caller to work around Problem in LWP
  Net::HTTPS

v0.999
- If SSL_cipher_list is not given it uses the openssl
  default instead of setting it to 'ALL:!LOW:!EXP' like
  before. The old value included ADH and this might be
  a bad idea, see BUGS why.

v0.998
- declare socket as opened before calling fatal_ssl_error
  because the SSL_error_trap set up from HTTP::Daemon
  needs this
- accept_SSL sets errors on $socket (the accepted socket)
  not $self (the listening socket if called from accept)
  so it can be queried from SSL_error_trap
- note in BUGS section that IO::Socket::SSL is not thread-safe

v0.997
- fix readline (e.g. getline,getlines,<>) so that it behaves
  regarding $/ like written in the $/ dokumentation.

v0.996
- removed links and comments to inofficial release of
  Net::SSLeay, because there is a newer version already

v0.995
- add support for Diffie Hellman Key Exchange.
  See parameter SSL_dh_file and SSL_dh.

v0.994
- hide DEBUG statements and remove test to load Debug.pm
  because packets like Spamassisin cannot cope with it
  (at least the OpenBSD port)

v0.993
- added SSL_cert and SSL_key parameter which do not take
  a file name like SSL_cert_file and SSL_key_file but
  an internal X509* resp. EVP_PKEY* value. Useful for
  dynamically created certificates and keys.
- added test for sysread/syswrite behavior (which was changed
  in v0.991)

v0.992
- _set_rw_error does $!||=EAGAIN only if error is one of
  SSL_WANT_READ|SSL_WANT_WRITE (patch from Mike Smith
  <mike at mailchannels dot com>)
- Fix Makefile.PL to allow detectection of failures in PREREQ_PM
  (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=20563, patch
  by alexchorny at gmail dot com)

v0.991
- sysread and syswrite ar no longer the same as read and write,
  but can return already if only parts of the data are read
  or written (which is the usual semantic for sysread and syswrite)
  This should fix problems with HTTP::Daemon::SSL

v0.99
- just upgrade Version number because I've screwed up upload
  of v0.98 to cpan

v0.98
- Maintainer changed to <Steffen_Ullrich at genua dot de>
- Better support for nonblocking sockets:
  . exports $SSL_ERROR which contains the latest error from
    the openssl library. Exports constants SSL_WANT_READ and
    SSL_WANT_WRITE es special errors which will be set if
    openssl wants to write or read during nonblocking connects,
    accepts, reads or writes.
  . accept,accept_SSL,connect and connect_SSL don't block
    anymore if the socket is nonblocking.
    Instead $! will be set from the underlying IO::Socket::INET
    connect or accept if it failed there (usually EAGAIN or
    EINPROGRESS) or if the underlying openssl needs to read or
    write $! will be set to EAGAIN and $SSL_ERROR will be set
    to SSL_WANT_READ or SSL_WANT_WRITE
  . syswrite returns undef and sets $!,$SSL_ERROR if it fails
    to write instead of returning 0.
- Bugfixes (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=Bugid)
  . Bug 18439: fileno 0 should be valid
  . Bug 15001: sysread interpretes buffer "0" as ""
- peer_certifcate returns X509 struct string if no field
  for extraction was specified
- get_peer_certificate returns the certificate instead of the
  IO::Socket::SSL object

v0.97
- Writes now correctly return errors.  (Problem noted by
  Dominique Quatravaux <dom at idealx.com>).
- CA paths now work without passing an empty SSL_ca_file
  argument.  (Problem found by Phil Pennock, <phil.pennock
  at globnix.org>).
- IO::Socket::SSL now automatically passes Proto => tcp (if
  not already specified) to IO::Socket::INET to work around
  /etc/services files with udp entries listed first.  (Fix
  suggested by Phil Pennock).
- $socket->accept() now returns the peer address in array
  context for better conformance with IO::Socket::INET.
  However, if you were doing "map { $_->accept } (@sockets)",
  or similar tricks, you will need to use "scalar" to get the
  old behavior back.  (Problem noted by Nils Sowen, <n.sowen
  at kon.de>).
- IO::Socket::SSL should now properly block on reads larger
  than the buffer size of Net::SSLeay.  (Problem found by Eric
  Jergensen, <eric at dvns.com>).
- IO::Socket::SSL should now send CA Certs (if necessary)
  along with certificates.  (Problem found by <roy at
  momentous.ca>).
- Timeouts should now work, but be aware that if multiple
  reads/writes are necessary to complete a connection, then
  each one may have a separate timeout.  (Request from
  Dominique Quatravaux <dom at idealx.com>).
- In certain cases, start_SSL() would misplace a socket's
  fileno, causing problems with starting SSL.  This should now
  be fixed.  (Problem found by <russ at zerotech.net>).
- IO::Socket::SSL now requires a minimum of Net::SSLeay 1.21.

--- Old Versions --------------------------------------------------

v0.96  2004.4.30
- Makefile's error messages now correct if output is
  redirected (patch from Ilya Zakharevich <ilya at
  math.berkeley.edu>).
- Non-blocking connects/accepts now work (Problem found by
  Uri Guttman <uri at stemsystems.com>).
- new_from_fd() now works.
- getline() and <> in scalar context now return undef
  instead of '' if the read failed.  (Problem found by
  Christian Gilmore <cag at us.ibm.com>).
- Broken pipe signals are now ignored during socket close
  to prevent a SSL shutdown message from killing the parent
  program.  (Problem found by Christian Gilmore).
- Tests should proceed much more quickly, and a semi-race was
  fixed, meaning that on slow machines the tests should be
  more reliable.
- Check for Scalar::Util and Weakref now uses default
  $SIG{__DIE__} instead of a potentially user-altered one
  (suggestion from Olaf Schneider <Olaf.Schneider at
  iwr.fzk.de>).  This only applies to Perl 5.6.0 & above.
- Session caching support (patch from Marko Asplund
  <marko.asplund at kronodoc.fi>).
- set_default_context() added to alter the behavior of
  modules that use IO::Socket::SSL from the main program.
- get_ssl_object() renamed to _get_ssl_object() to reflect
  the fact that it's only supposed to be used internally
  (not that you should have cared, of course).
- Added patch for Net::SSLeay to take advantage of
  client-side session caching.

v0.95  2003.8.25
- Changed PeerAddr in example/ssl_client.pl back to localhost.
- Update of examples to automatically switch to the proper
  directory if they cannot find the necessary SSL certificates.
- Minor documentation update with more INET6 info.
- Corrected some error messages for IO::Socket::INET6.
- Better opened() behavior when sockets close unexpectedly.
- Added note about random number generators for Solaris users
  (Problem found by Christian Gilmore <cag at us.ibm.com>).
- Added support for WeakRef and Scalar::Util to allow
  IO::Socket::SSL objects to auto-destroy themselves when
  they go out of scope.
- Added croak()ing for unimplemented send() and recv() methods
  so they are not accidentally used to transmit unencrypted
  data.  The Perl builtin functions cannot be reliably trapped
  and are still dangerous, a fact that the POD now reflects
  (Problem noted by Michal Ludvig <michal at logix.cx>).

v0.94  2003.6.26
- Changed accept() to use inherited accept() instead of
  IO::Socket::accept, so that IPv6 inheritance is possible.
- Added options to import() so that a user could specify
  IPv6 or IPv4 mode of operation.
- Documentation fixes, esp. e-mail address.

v0.93  2003.6.24
- Fixed error-checking slip in connect_SSL() (Problem found by
  Uri Guttman <uri at stemsystems.com>).
- All functions now return the empty list () on errors.
- Added note about the above change to appease Graham Barr
  <gbarr at pobox.com>.
- Fixed Net::SSLeay giving warnings when arguments are undef;
  in all cases, undef arguments may be set to '' without any
  change in behavior except for removing the warnings.
  (Problem found by Dominique Quatravaux <dom at idealx.com>)
- If accept() or connect() fails in SSL negotiation, the user
  now has the option to print something to the failed socket
  before it is closed.  (error_trap option in new())
- Added support for CRLs (SSL_check_crl option in new()) for
  versions of OpenSSL >= 0.9.7b (Original patch from
  Brian Lindauer <jbl at sysd.com>)
- Finally added decent support for certificate callbacks.
  (SSL_verify_callback option in new(), suggestion from
  Dariush Pietrzak <eyck at ghost.anime.pl>).
- accept()/connect()/socket_to_SSL() now fail immediately if
  the socket in question does not have a fileno.
- Added the kill_socket() method to guarantee that a socket dies.
- Fixed extra warning when printing errors in debug mode.
- Deprecated socket_to_SSL() in favor of the class method
  start_SSL() (Class method suggestion from Graham Barr
  <gbarr at pobox.com>).
- Added the class method start_SSL() to allow for cases when
  the desired class of the socket is not IO::Socket::SSL
  (Request from Dariush Pietrzak <eyck at ghost.anime.pl>)
- Changed socket_to_SSL to rebless socket to original class
  if SSL negotiation failed (Request from Graham Barr
  <gbarr at pobox.com>)
- Removed the daemon.pl example, as it did not work with the
  standard distribution of HTTP::Daemon (use HTTP::Daemon::SSL
  instead).

v0.92   2002.10.22
- Changed the fileno() function to support returning the fileno
  of server sockets.  (Problem found by Roland Giersig
  <RGiersig at cpan.org>).
- Fixed SSL_version incorrectly defaulting to SSLv2 (patch from
  Roland Alder <roland.alder at celeris.ch>).

v0.91   2002.08.31
- Added support for SSL_peek and SSL_pending (peek() and
  pending()).  Updated documentation, tests, etc. to reflect
  this.

v0.901  2002.08.19
- Fixed the warning that happens when sockets are not explicitly
  closed() before the program terminates.

v0.90   2002.08.13
- This version is a complete rewrite of IO::Socket::SSL.  It now
  has about half the lines of code, twice the amount of documentation,
  and a slightly more polished interface.
- IO::Socket::SSL now works properly with mod_perl and taint mode.
- Major documentation update.
- Update of the BUGS file to reflect changes made in the rewrite.
- Update of the test suite for Perl v5.8.0 (or, more precisely,
  for Scalar::Util).
- Update of the test suite for Perl v5.00503 (or, more precisely,
  for the lack of several nice features added in v5.6.0) (Marko
  Asplund <aspa at kronodoc.fi>).
- New test suite that does not need the Internet to function.
- Update of all the files in example/ to use more current features
  of IO::Socket::SSL.
- Removal of SSL_SSL and X509_Certificate classes.
- There have been a few name changes (like socketToSSL ->
  socket_to_SSL) for better consistency.
- The functionality of get_peer_certificate() and friends is deprecated.
- The functionality of want_write() and want_read() is deprecated.
- The functionality of context_init() is deprecated for normal use.
- Support for all SSL context options in the new() call.
- SSL contexts are no longer global.  The SSL_reuse_ctx option
  is provided for those who want to re-use a context.
- The default verify mode is now VERIFY_NONE.
- IO::Socket::SSL::DEBUG is now linked to Net::SSLeay::trace to
  provide different levels of debugging information.
- There is a uniform interface for error reporting, so on error
  all functions will return undef and the error will be available
  by calling errstr().
- The dump_peer_certificate() and peer_certificate() functions
  have been added.
- sysread() will now behave correctly if the offset argument is
  greater than the length of the read buffer.  It also will truncate
  the read buffer properly, according to the Perl documentation for
  sysread().
- getline(), getlines(), and getc() have been added.
- syswrite() now uses references to avoid copying large	amounts of data.
- readline() uses ssl_read_all in array context for improved speed.
- close() now uses SSL_shutdown() to properly close an SSL connection,
  unless you tell it not to.
- If you have Net::SSLeay version 1.18 or greater, X509 certificates
  will be properly freed.
- All other known bugs have been fixed.

v0.81a (Not publically released)
- Added support for SSL_passwd_cb.
- Added accept() server socket support to socketToSSL().

v0.81   2002.04.10
- calling context_init twice destroyed global context. fix from
  Jason Heiss <jheiss at ofb.net>.

- angle bracket readline operator support
  (David Darville <david at dark.x.dtu.dk>).
- eliminate warnings in choosing SSL protocol version.
- implement our own opened method and make length parameter optional
  in syswrite (Robert Bihlmeyer <robbe at orcus.priv.at>).

v0.78	2001.04.24
- test script targets changed, certificate setup fixed
- support for TLS in SSL_version. SSL_version parameter values
  changed from integer to string. NB: this is an incompatible change.
  all SSL_version parameter values have to be changed. valid values
  include: 'sslv2', 'sslv3', 'sslv23'. Stephen C. Koehler
  <koehler at securecomputing.com>.
- enable selecting SSL version for connections. patch from
  Takanori Ugai <ugai at jp.fujitsu.com>.
- allow setting SSL_ca_file to ''. this is needed for being
  able to use SSL_ca_path (Robert Bihlmeyer <robbe at orcus.priv.at>).
- include the Apache CA bundle file in the distribution (my-ca.pem).
- BUGS file added.

v0.77	2001.01.15

Hi,

IO-Socket-SSL was released a while ago with a security fix:

<http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/SULLR/IO-Socket-SSL-1.30/Changes>
v1.26 2009.07.03
- SECURITY BUGFIX!
  fix Bug in verify_hostname_of_cert where it matched only the prefix for
  the hostname when no wildcard was given, e.g. www.example.org matched

# IO::Socket::SSL: Certificate validation error — GLSA **201101-06**

An error in the hostname matching of IO::Socket::SSL might enable remote
attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-perl/IO-Socket-SSL** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.26** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.26** |

### Background

IO::Socket::SSL is a Perl class implementing an object oriented
interface to SSL sockets.

### Description

The vendor reported that IO::Socket::SSL does not properly handle
Common Name (CN) fields.

### Impact

A remote attacker might employ a specially crafted certificate to
conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on SSL connections made using
IO::Socket::SSL.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All IO::Socket::SSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-perl/IO-Socket-SSL-1.26"
```

Subject: Re: CVE request: perl-IO-Socket-SSL certificate hostname compare bug

Hi,

Just to make you able to classify the problem a bit more:
The fix is important but the impact of the problem is in my opinion currently minor,
because
- the feature to help checking the hostname against the certificate is fairly new
- in former times the apps/modules using IO::Socket::SSL had to implement
  the checking by itself (using the appropriate logic, which differs between
  various protocols).
- most did not implement any checking at all or implemented a limited or wrong check
- therefore I added the checks, where the app only has to decide how the check
  has to be done
- most apps/modules don't even do this simple thing yet, so that this buggy
  feature was not used

That means, that it only impacts apps/modules which depend on this feature
and there are only few (or none) of these apps. But it would probably be nice
to add a note to the CVE that apps/modules should start to implement proper
certificate checking and that it got easier with newer IO::Socket::SSL
versions.

Regards,
Steffen (Maintainer of IO::Socket::SSL)

yes, this is a good idea.
The version 1.14 was released 2008/07/16 and the necessary Net::SSLeay
version 1.34 (which is needed for this feature) was release 2008/07/24.

I did not check it yet.
If there is a problem it has to be fixed in Net::SSLeay, IO::Socket::SSL
is perl only and perl itself has no problems with strings containing \0.
>From the code in SSLeay.xs X509_get_subjectAltNames I would say, that
this part should be no problem, because it explicitly uses ASN1_STRING_length
to specify the length of the string. But I'm not sure about the use
of X509_get_subject_name where it magically converts an X509_NAME* into
a perl string.
I keep you updated once I've checked it.

Steffen

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice.org fixes potential buffer overflow in EMF
parser code (enhwmf.cxx, emfplus.cxx). Additionally Secunia reported an
integer underflow (CVE-2009-0200) and a buffer overflow (CVE-2009-0201)
that could be triggered while parsing Word documents.
Also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.1.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.1.1.html>
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, NLD9, SLE10, SLE11
- dnsmasq
This update fixes a buffer overflow in the TFTP server code of dnsmasq.
Please note that the TFTP server is disabled by default.
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE11
- gnutls
This update of gnutls improves the verification of the domain/subject
names in a SSL certificate. CVE-2009-2730 has been assigned to this
issue.
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10, SLE11
- ia32el
A 32bit x86 user program could crash the Itanium IA64 kernel in the
IA 32 (Intel 32bit) emulation. (CVE-2009-2707)
Released for product: SLE10
Updateing IA32EL to 7042\_7022, the same version as shipped on SLES 10
SP3, fixes this problem.
- ib-bonding-kmp-rt/kernel-rt/ofed
This patch updates the SLERT10 SP2 kernel to Update 7 to address
multiple issues:
- Lots of HR Timer fixes and improvements.
The complete list of changes can be seen in the rpm changelog.
It also fixes several security issues, some of the critical:
CVE-2009-2692: A missing NULL pointer check in the socket sendpage
function can be used by local attackers to gain root privileges.
CVE-2009-2406: A kernel stack overflow when mounting eCryptfs filesystems
in parse\_tag\_11\_packet() was fixed. Code execution might be possible
of ecryptfs is in use.
CVE-2009-2407: A kernel heap overflow when mounting eCryptfs filesystems
in parse\_tag\_3\_packet() was fixed. Code execution might be possible
of ecryptfs is in use.
Released for product: SLERT10
- libxml
This update of libxml does not use pointers after they were freed
anymore. (CVE-2009-2416)
Additionally a stack-based buffer overflow was fixed while parsing the
root XML document. (CVE-2009-2414)
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- opera
Opera version 10 includes at least security fixes for an XML
denial-of-service bug (CVE-2009-1234) and the "SSL tampering" attack
(CVE-2009-2059, CVE-2009-2063, CVE-2009-2067, CVE-2009-2070).
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- perl-IO-Socket-SSL
This update of perl-IO-Socket-SSL improves the hostname checking of the
SSL certificate. (CVE-2009-3024)
Released for product: openSUSE 11.1, SLE11
- xen
xend did not properly enforce access control of the xenstore
directory tree, therefore allowing guest VM's to write there.
This could lead to security problems if other applications such as
libvirt are not prepared for untrusted data in the xenstore
directory (CVE-2008-4405).
Released for product: openSUSE 11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
