Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3313:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the FMyClone 2.3 application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities in the following locations:
    - `index.php?comp=[SQLi/BSQL]`
    - `edit.php?act=comment&comp=2&id=[SQLi]` (requires admin privileges)
    - `editComments.php?comp=1' union all select 1,2,@@version,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11--+`
    
**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to:
  - Data breaches (accessing sensitive information stored in the database)
  - Data modification (altering or deleting data)
  - Full database takeover (depending on the privileges of the database user)

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities are reachable through HTTP GET requests by manipulating URL parameters such as `comp` and `id`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable FMyClone application.
- For the `edit.php` vulnerability, the attacker needs to have admin privileges.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit-db entry provides specific vulnerable URLs and a sample payload demonstrating the SQL injection in `editComments.php`.
- The exploit-db entry indicates that the issue may affect versions lower than 2.3.
