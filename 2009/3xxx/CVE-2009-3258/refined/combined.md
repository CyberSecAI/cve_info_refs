### Description

It appears that any user can currently delete an attachment assuming they have View privileges to a particular Module. If you are trying to use vtiger as any sort of document control mechanism, this access is unacceptable. Please review this thread for more details:

[​http://forums.vtiger.com/viewtopic.php?t=16756](http://forums.vtiger.com/viewtopic.php?t=16756)

At the very least, the deletion of Attachments should be removed for Profiles that have View only access.

### Change History (1)

### [comment:1](#comment:1) Changed [16 years ago](/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/timeline?from=2009-03-06T14%3A42%3A10Z&precision=second "See timeline at Mar 6, 2009 2:42:10 PM") by asha

* **Resolution**
  set to *fixed*
* **Status**
  changed from *new* to *closed*

In 5.1.0, there is no concept of attachments. Attachments and Notes together are treated as Documents. These documents follow the same security model as that of other modules of the CRM.

Reports now have some flexibility to mark reports either as Public/Private? or Share with selected users. Security is added on reports based on this.

Custom filters are now role based. And the security on the filters (edit/delete) is also role based.

# Critical security feature - attachment, reports, filters

[![VinOnTiger](https://discussions.vtiger.com/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png)](/profile/VinOnTiger "VinOnTiger")[VinOnTiger](/profile/VinOnTiger)

[October 2007](https://discussions.vtiger.com/discussion/16756/critical-security-feature-attachment-reports-filters)
 edited March 2009   in [Feature Requests - 5.0.4](https://discussions.vtiger.com/categories/feature-requests-5-0-4) [**Vote Up**](/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16756)0[**Vote Down**](/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F16756)

**Attachments**

Anyone, even the guest profile, even without insert/delete permission on modules, can insert and delete attachments, even those inserted by other users.

**Reports**

Anyone, even the guest profile, even without insert/delete/edit permission on modules, can insert, delete and edit reports, even those inserted by other users.

**Filters**

Anyone, even the guest profile, even without insert/delete/edit permission on modules, can insert, delete and edit filters, even those inserted by other users.

In a old post on this forum someone told me that this was a good feature and a ticket has been opened, but on the 5.0.4 test site

<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="[http://en.vtiger.com/wip">http://en.vtiger.com/wip</a><!--](http://en.vtiger.com/wip%22%3Ehttp%3A//en.vtiger.com/wip%3C/a%3E%3C%21--) m -->

all stilll 'works" on the same way.

I've just created the guest1 user (password guest1) with the guest profile

and I've deleted some default filters, I've edited default reports and deleted custom reports created from other users, deleted other users's attachments, and so on... all having just the guest profile.

I'm using vTiger in my organization since march 2007, but I'm having seriuos security problem because of this lack and I really hope that this feature will be implemented as soon as possible.

  sorry, but the ticket opened does not solve the problem. the ticket is described as

  "would be nice feature - possibility to set up various default view for various users/groups."

  it just give the option to create personal view, but the security hole is still present on the 5.0.4 version.

  the problem i'm talking about is more complex ad it'a about security.

  please try to log in with a guest profile and verify that you can create, edit and delete a lot of views, reports, tickets, attachments, etc...

**Attachments**

Anyone, even the guest profile, even without insert/delete permission on modules, can insert and delete attachments, even those inserted by other users.

**Reports**

I hope someone will tell me that there's already an easy way to avoid these problems without doing a feature request <!-- s![:wink:](https://discussions.vtiger.com/resources/emoji/wink.png ":wink:") --><img src="{SMILIES\_PATH}/icon\_wink.gif" alt="![:wink:](https://discussions.vtiger.com/resources/emoji/wink.png ":wink:")" title="Wink" /><!-- s![:wink:](https://discussions.vtiger.com/resources/emoji/wink.png ":wink:") -->

  sorry, i have to upgrade my signature <!-- s:) --><img src="{smilies\_path}/icon\_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="smile" /><!-- s:) -->

  yes, we're running the 5.0.3 versione.

  but i've also tested all on en.vtiger.com and it 'works' the same way.

  i'm having a similar issue: the profiles appear with everything checked, the only way to stop it is to erase the module altogether... it started when updating from 5.0.1 to 5.0.3

  dear vinontiger,

  as we cann't set permission for attachment, all crm-users has permission to do file attachement. however we can disable the delete permission for file attachement, if the user has only the view permission for particular record.
  > **reports**
  >
  > anyone, even the guest profile, even without insert/delete/edit permission on modules, can insert, delete and edit reports, even those inserted by other users.

  if the user does not have permission for particular module, he cann't create/edit/view/delete reports for that module. for eg. if **potentials** module is not permitted for the user **smith**, smith can not create/edit/view/delete potentials related reports. but the following functionalties need to be implemented.
  1) if only view permission given for particular module say potentials, create/edit/delete permission for potentials-reports should be disabled.
  2) if create/edit and view permission given, delete permission should be disabled.
  3) if delete and view permission given, create permission should be disabled[/list:u]

  as the customview-filter is not specific to any module/user, it can be edited/deleted by any crm-user. however we can provide an option for do not edit/delete. if an user create a customview filter and enable this option, this filter can not be deleted/edited by other users.

  this is my opinion. kindly give yours.

  thanks & regards,

  minnie.

  if enyone can add an attachment is a minor problem.

  the problem is that now vtiger doesn't work as you said. if a user has only the view permission on a specific module he can still delete any attachment about that module. please try it.

  i agree with you on these rules <!-- s:) --><img src="{smilies\_path}/icon\_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="smile" /><!-- s:) -->

  but there is a problem now: if a user has only the view permission on a module, he can edit the report, please try it.

  \*now\* any user, without regard on which kind of permission has, can edit/delete or add any filter, even the default ones that come with the installation.

  i believe that only the administrator or a specific profile should be able to add/edit/delete filters.

  when a user create e filter it is visible to anyone.

  let's imagine what kind of confusion if any user really will start to do so: suddenly the combo filters will have a lot of filters.

  it would be advisable to add an option like that:

  1) add/edit/delete filters is bound to specific profile

  2) the filter should have an option public/private or, better, to relate the view to groups/roles, so every users/groups has only the filter about own interest in the combo filter.

  3) it should be possible to define the order of filters visualization, because now they are ordered in the combo filter in the same order in which you add them.

  thank you

  was there ever any resolution to the filter issue? i think filters have to have a public/private option.

  we have 65 potential users, it's going to be a mess showing all filters all the time.

  it also appears that 'my sites' are shared between all users. again this is going to be a mess.

  i'm looking at the tables now, i don't see anything tying the creator to the filter, it appears a new filter\_owner field is going to be needed to initially keep custom fields private to their creator/owner.

  i'd like to at least keep the filters private for the moment, expand into the permissions system later.

  your users are useing mainly one filter ore more than one ?

  because if only/mainly one, so will be better think about, how setup diferent filters for diferent users/groups as default in first step....
