Debian Security Advisory DSA-1925-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Steffen Joeris
October 31, 2009                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : proftpd-dfsg
Vulnerability  : insufficient input validation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2009-3639

It has been discovered that proftpd-dfsg, a virtual-hosting FTP daemon,
does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the
Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 client certificate, when the
dNSNameRequired TLS option is enabled.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1-17lenny4.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.0-19etch3.

Binaries for the amd64 architecture will be released once they are
available.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.3.2a-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3275#c0)  TJ Saunders    2009-08-06 12:49:41 UTC  ``` A recent bug was found in fetchmail, which pointed out that when validing SSL client certificates, fetchmail was not properly checking for embedded NUL characters:    <http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-SA-2009-01.txt>  This is a bug for the mod_tls module as well, for the mod_tls module does a similar verification of SSL client certs.  Specifically, for this embedded-NUL issue to affect a server, the following mod_tls configuration must be in effect:    # Reverse DNS resolution MUST be on for this bug to manifest   UseReverseDNS on    <IfModule mod_tls.c>     TLSEngine on      # We have to be verifying clients' certs for this bug to manifest     TLSVerifyClient on      # and we have to be requiring that the subjectAltName field of the     # client's certificate be a DNS name which matches the DNS name to which     # the client's IP address was resolved     TLSOptions dNSNameRequired   </IfModule>  If reverse DNS resolution is off, OR if client certs are not being verified, OR if the DNS name in the client cert is not required, then the bug does not occur. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3275#c1)  TJ Saunders    2009-08-06 12:55:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3096](attachment.cgi?id=3096 "Fixes bug") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=3096&action=edit "Fixes bug") Fixes bug ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3275#c2)  TJ Saunders    2009-08-06 12:59:00 UTC  ``` Patch committed to CVS. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3275#c3)  TJ Saunders    2009-08-06 13:01:19 UTC  ``` Backported to 1.3.2b; the attached patch applied cleanly to the 1.3.2a version of mod_tls. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3275#c4)  TJ Saunders    2009-08-11 11:37:15 UTC  ``` See also:    <http://www.thoughtcrime.org/papers/null-prefix-attacks.pdf> ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=3275#c5)  TJ Saunders    2009-10-20 18:24:01 UTC  ``` Resolved in 1.3.2b, 1.3.3rc2. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=3275#c6)  TJ Saunders    2009-10-24 14:43:47 UTC  ``` CVE-2009-3639 assigned for this. ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=530719#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-10-24 13:30:11 UTC  ``` mod_tls.c in ProFTPD 1.3.2a does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the subject's alternative name (subjectAltName) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to [CVE-2009-2408](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-2408).  Upstream bug report: -------------------- <http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3275>  Upstream patch: --------------- <http://bugs.proftpd.org/attachment.cgi?id=3096>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=530719#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-10-24 13:34:00 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the ProFTPD package, as shipped with Fedora releases of 10 and 11 (proftpd-1.3.2a-5.fc{10,11}),  and as shipped within Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 (EPEL-4, EPEL-5) projects (proftpd-1.3.2a-5.el{4,5}).   Please fix.  This issue does NOT affect the versions of the ProFTPD package, as scheduled to appear in Fedora release of 12 and 13  (proftpd-1.3.2b-1.fc12 and proftpd-1.3.2b-1.fc13) - these are already fixed.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=530719#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-10-26 08:46:47 UTC  ``` I'd say impact of this flaw should be pretty low.  Reading the upstream bug, this problem occurs when ProFTPD's mod_tls is configured to check subjectAltName in _client's_ certificates against _client's_ IP/hostname (client IP address is resolved to hostname and that hostname is resolved back to IP, if you can get to the same IP (basic sanity check), hostname is compared to the subjectAltName in the certificate).  I'm not aware of any other SSL server doing a check like this, as this is a bit strange feature.  SSL server certificate checks are used to make sure you're talking to the right server making sure you can't get tricked by malicious / owned DNS.  This check, however, relies on security of DNS...  So as far as I can see, this can be used by client to bypass intended source host name restriction.  Attacker needs to have a valid client certificate that is accepted by ProFTPD, with specially crafted sAN what would allow him to connect from other host than intended.  So rather limited impact, and probably not very often used check / restriction.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=530719#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-16 20:54:20 UTC  ``` proftpd-1.3.2b-1.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/proftpd-1.3.2b-1.fc11>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=530719#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-16 20:56:42 UTC  ``` proftpd-1.3.2b-1.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/proftpd-1.3.2b-1.fc10>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=530719#c6)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-16 20:59:38 UTC  ``` proftpd-1.3.2b-1.el5 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 5. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/proftpd-1.3.2b-1.el5>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=530719#c7)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-16 21:00:48 UTC  ``` proftpd-1.3.2b-1.el4 has been submitted as an update for Fedora EPEL 4. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/proftpd-1.3.2b-1.el4>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=530719#c8)  Fedora Update System    2009-11-18 14:08:06 UTC  ``` proftpd-1.3.2b-1.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
