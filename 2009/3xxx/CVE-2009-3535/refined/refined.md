{
  "CVE-2009-3535": {
    "Description": "ClearContent is vulnerable to local and remote file inclusion via the 'url' parameter in the image.php script. An attacker can include local files using path traversal or include remote files by specifying a malicious URL when register_globals is enabled.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application improperly handles the 'url' parameter in the image.php script, allowing arbitrary file inclusion.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive local files, potentially gaining access to system information or application source code. If register_globals is enabled, remote code execution is possible by including and executing malicious remote scripts.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request to image.php with a manipulated 'url' parameter."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. For remote file inclusion, register_globals must be enabled on the server."
  }
