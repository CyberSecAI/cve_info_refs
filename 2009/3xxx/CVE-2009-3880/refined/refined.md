Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details related to CVE-2009-3880:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) passing entire objects to the logging API. This can lead to unintended leakage of sensitive information to unprivileged code. Specifically, `Component` and `DefaultKeyboardFocusManager` were identified as passing security-sensitive objects to loggers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Leakage: The core weakness is the exposure of sensitive data through logging mechanisms. Objects containing sensitive information, such as user data or system internals, are passed directly to loggers without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the potential for sensitive information leakage to unauthorized entities or unprivileged code. This could expose confidential data, potentially aiding further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by actions within the Java environment that cause logging to occur. The exact nature of these actions might vary based on how the affected components are used within the application or environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a position to trigger logging within a vulnerable Java application or environment. The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable logging mechanism to reveal the sensitive information. No specific position is required, just a way to trigger the vulnerable logging.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content highlights that this is one of many vulnerabilities addressed in the referenced security advisories.
- The vulnerability impacts multiple versions of Sun JDK/JRE, including versions 1.4.x, 1.5.x and 1.6.x.
- The vulnerability also affects OpenJDK.
- Gentoo has ceased support for Java 1.4 due to this vulnerability.
- Red Hat has released multiple security advisories (RHSA-2009:1560, RHSA-2009:1571, RHSA-2009:1584, and RHSA-2009:1662) to address this and other related issues.
- Fedora also released updates.
