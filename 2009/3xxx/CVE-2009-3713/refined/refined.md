```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the fichero.php script. Specifically, the script directly uses user-controlled data within a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Blind SQL injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including usernames and password hashes. The provided exploit specifically targets password hash extraction.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the fichero.php script, which includes malicious SQL code in the query string parameters.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter(s) and SQL syntax.
