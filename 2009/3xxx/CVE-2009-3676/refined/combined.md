# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-020 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in SMB Client Could Allow Remote Code Execution (980232)

Published: April 13, 2010 | Updated: May 26, 2010

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker sent a specially crafted SMB response to a client-initiated SMB request. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must convince the user to initiate an SMB connection to a specially crafted SMB server.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the manner in which the SMB client handles SMB responses, allocates memory, and validates fields within the SMB response. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 977544](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/977544).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 980232](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/980232) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

## SMB Client Incomplete Response Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3676

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation handles specially crafted SMB responses. An attempt to exploit the vulnerability would not require authentication, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SMB response to a client-initiated SMB request. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the computer to stop responding until restarted.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-3676](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3676).

#### Mitigating Factors for SMB Client Incomplete Response Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3676

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* This denial-of-service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop responding until manually restarted.
* Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed. In this case, the SMB ports should be blocked from the Internet.

#### Workarounds for SMB Client Incomplete Response Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3676

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. For this specific vulnerability, both inbound and outbound SMB traffic should be blocked to reduce exposure. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for SMB Client Incomplete Response Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3676

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a denial of service vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding until it is manually restarted. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop responding until manually restarted.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists because the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation incorrectly handles incomplete SMB responses.

**What is Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol?**

Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a Microsoft network file sharing protocol used in Microsoft Windows. For more information on SMB, see the MSDN article, Microsoft SMB Protocol and CIFS Protocol Overview.

**What is Microsoft Server Message Block Version 2 (SMBv2)?**

Server Message Block (SMB) is the file sharing protocol used by default on Windows-based computers. SMB Version 2.0 (SMBv2) is an update to this protocol, and is only supported on computers running Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Vista. SMBv2 can only be used if both client and server support it. If either client or server cannot support SMBv2, the SMB 1.0 protocol will be used instead. The SMB protocol version to be used for file operations is decided during the negotiation phase. During the negotiation phase, a Windows Vista client advertises to the server that it can understand the new SMBv2 protocol. If the server (Windows Server 2008 or later) understands SMBv2, then SMBv2 is chosen for subsequent communication. Otherwise the client and server use SMB 1.0 and continue to function as normal. For more information on SMBv2, see the MSDN article, [Server Message Block (SMB) Version 2 Protocol Specification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc246482%28prot.13%29.aspx).

**What is the difference between SMBv1 and SMBv2?**

Both protocols are used by clients to request file and print services from a server system over the network. Both are stateful protocols in which clients establish a connection to a server, establish an authenticated context on that connection, and then issue a variety of requests to access files, printers, and named pipes for interprocess communication. The SMBv2 protocol is a major revision of the existing SMB protocol. While many of the underlying concepts are the same, the packet formats are completely different. In addition to providing all of the capabilities found in SMBv1, the SMBv2 protocol provides several enhancements:

* Allowing an open to a file to be reestablished after a client connection becomes temporarily disconnected.
* Allowing the server to balance the number of simultaneous operations that a client can have outstanding at any time.
* Providing scalability in terms of the number of shares, users, and simultaneously open files.
* Supporting symbolic links.
* Using a stronger algorithm to validate the integrity of requests and responses.

**What versions of SMB are impacted by this vulnerability?**

This vulnerability affects both SMBv1 and SMBv2.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a user's system to stop responding until manually restarted.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted SMB server that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to initiate an SMB connection with it. Additionally, an attacker on the local network could perform a man-in-the-middle attack to respond to a legitimate SMB request with a malformed SMB response.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All affected operating systems are at risk.

**Can this vulnerability be exploited using Internet Explorer?**

No. However, this issue may be exploited through Web transactions, regardless of browser type. In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web page that contains a specially crafted URI. A user who browsed that Web site will force an SMB connection to an SMB server controlled by the attacker, which would then send a malformed response back to the user. This response would result in the users' system becoming nonresponsive. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What is a URI?**

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to act on or identify resources from the Internet or over a network. A URL is a typical example of a URI that references a resource such as a Web site. For more information about URIs, see [RFC-2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt).

**What does the update do?**

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the SMB client handles incomplete SMB responses.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2009-3676](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3676).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## SMB Client Memory Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0269

An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client implementation allocates memory when parsing specially crafted SMB responses. An attempt to exploit the vulnerability would not require authentication, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SMB response to a client-initiated SMB request. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0269](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0269).

#### FAQ for SMB Client Transaction Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0270

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists because by the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) client improperly validates fields in the SMB response. This could lead to a memory corruption issue resulting in code execution with system-level privileges.

**What is Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol?**

Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is a Microsoft network file sharing protocol used in Microsoft Windows. For more information on SMB, see the MSDN article, [Microsoft SMB Protocol and CIFS Protocol Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa365233%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What is Microsoft Server Message Block Version 2 (SMBv2)?**

Server Message Block (SMB) is the file sharing protocol used by default on Windows-based computers. SMB Version 2.0 (SMBv2) is an update to this protocol, and is only supported on computers running Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Vista. SMBv2 can only be used if both client and server support it. If either client or server cannot support SMBv2, the SMB 1.0 protocol will be used instead. The SMB protocol version to be used for file operations is decided during the negotiation phase. During the negotiation phase, a Windows Vista client advertises to the server that it can understand the new SMBv2 protocol. If the server (Windows Server 2008 or later) understands SMBv2, then SMBv2 is chosen for subsequent communication. Otherwise the client and server use SMB 1.0 and continue to function as normal. For more information on SMBv2, see the MSDN article, [Server Message Block (SMB) Version 2 Protocol Specification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc246482%28prot.13%29.aspx).

**What is the difference between SMBv1 and SMBv2?**

Both protocols are used by clients to request file and print services from a server system over the network. Both are stateful protocols in which clients establish a connection to a server, establish an authenticated context on that connection, and then issue a variety of requests to access files, printers, and named pipes for interprocess communication. The SMBv2 protocol is a major revision of the existing SMB protocol. While many of the underlying concepts are the same, the packet formats are completely different. In addition to providing all of the capabilities found in SMBv1, the SMBv2 protocol provides several enhancements:

* Allowing an open to a file to be reestablished after a client connection becomes temporarily disconnected.
* Allowing the server to balance the number of simultaneous operations that a client can have outstanding at any time.
* Providing scalability in terms of the number of shares, users, and simultaneously open files.
* Supporting symbolic links.
* Using a stronger algorithm to validate the integrity of requests and responses.

**What versions of SMB are impacted by this vulnerability?**

The issue addressed by this CVE affects both SMBv1 and SMBv2.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. Most attempts to exploit this vulnerability will cause an affected system to stop responding and restart.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted SMB server that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to initiate an SMB connection with it. Additionally, an attacker on the local network could perform a man-in-the-middle attack to respond to a legitimate SMB request with a malformed SMB response.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

All affected operating systems are at risk.

**Can this vulnerability be exploited using Internet Explorer?**

No. However, this issue may be exploited through Web transactions, regardless of browser type. In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web page that contains a specially crafted URI. A user who browsed that Web site will force an SMB connection to an SMB server controlled by the attacker, which would then send a malformed response back to the user. This response would result in the users' system becoming nonresponsive. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What is a URI?**

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to act on or identify resources from the Internet or over a network. A URL is a typical example of a URI that references a resource such as a Web site. For more information about URIs, see [RFC-2396](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt).

**What does the update do?**

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which fields within the SMB response are validated.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

### [Windows 7 / Server 2008R2 Remote Kernel Crash](https://g-laurent.blogspot.com/2009/11/windows-7-server-2008r2-remote-kernel.html)

This bug is a real proof that SDL FAIL

The bug trigger an infinite loop on smb{1,2}, pre-auth, no credential needed...

Can be trigered outside the lan via (IE\*)

The bug is so basic, it should have been spotted 2 years ago by the SDL if the SDL had ever existed:

netbios\_header = struct.pack(">i", len(''.join(SMB\_packet))+SMB\_packet

(The netbios header provide the length of the incoming smb{1,2} packet)

If netbios\_header is 4 bytes smaller or more than SMB\_packet, it just blow !

WHAT ?? you gotta be kidding me where's my SDL ?!?

"Most secure Os ever";

What ever your firewall is set to, you can get remotely smashed via IE or even via some broadcasting nbns tricks (no user interaction)

Nice one. You're really getting down on the MS SDL team...

Have you debugged this vulnerability? The crash is a result of what..? Overflow? Pointer deference?

Aaaahhh ok I didn't saw this - Crash in KeAccumulateTicks() due to NT\_ASSERT()/DbgRaiseAssertionFailure() caused by an infinite loop. NO BSOD, YOU GOTTA PULL THE PLUG.

This is, really, unbelievable. The most secure os ever ... crashes trough an trivial Infinitive loop (moreover caused by a remote packet ) ? That's such amazing ! Good Job man !
My question, what was the bell that suggested you to investigate into this direction ? Why SMB ? It's old and, theoretically, assumed "safe" .
Again good job !

You can simplify your POC and make it:
packet = "\x00\x00\x00\x9a"

The other lines are not being concatenated to the packet, so they are a no-op, and you only need to send 4 bytes to trigger this issue.

Actually, the other lines are being concatenated. This is a feature of Python to allow multiple line strings.

The Internet Storm Center http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=7573 said you left out one line of code and there was also some formatting issues. The speculation was that this was intentional on your part "to give Microsoft a chance to get a fix in..."

Is that true? Are you trying to go easy on MS or what?

Whats wrong with Microsoft and their apparent lack of any security whatsoever? This exploit couldnt possibly have made it past any fuzzer or attempt at auditing the code. They still just throw code together and skip it the instant it compiles, bugs be damned.

SDL is a joke, a PR stunt at best. Probably just one bloke writing a blog and not something ever used inside Microsoft.

Responsible disclosure is something that only works if there are responsible vendors. As long as MS and others take security as a PR issue its much better to do as laurent and let people know about the issues fast and take their own actions to mitigate problems / change vendor.

Excellent work Laurent. How long did it take to find this one? Fuck the non-disclosure or the "give micro$oft their time to fix it" people. They had their time.. they had PLENTY of time to fuzz the shit out of their code. How long did vista take? How many people work at micro$oft? God damn bluehat people have probably been saying this for years yet... seems like they're skipping that step of the SDL. Maybe releasing things full disclosure will make them change their ways (more than they already have) although that didn't work in the past. Fuck'em.

How dare Microsoft or anyone else attack Mr. Gaffie or call him irresponsible over the release of this vulnerability/poc. It is not my job nor Mr. Gaffie's to provide free consulting services to Microsoft in order to fix or improve their shitty products.

Maybe one day Microsoft will get it threw their thick heads that compensation AND public recognition will slow the release of poc source. From my understanding, they offer no compensation, no public recognition, no gifts (software/msdn subscriptions).... NOTHING....

But, they expect all developers to volunteer their time, knowledge, and expertise for nothing.

F\*ck them and the horse they rode in on...

But then again, these are just the opinions of one individual....

If SDL fails, then why do products like Internet Explorer, SQL Server, Windows Media and Silverlight have much fewer (4 times less) critical flaws discovered each year than Firefox, Oracle, Quick Time and Adobe Flash Player?

that must mean that products like Firefox, Oracle, Quick Time, Flash player are just plain FAILures themselves, coded in a crappy way!

Anyway, you don't seem to understand what SDL is.
If you believe that any development process could be able to lead to a flawless software, then you have no clue about what you're talking about.

You must think that linux is a huge failure too, since the typical linux distribution has much more flaws than any windows version (even those developped without SDL).

No, i dont believe in flawless software, but i do believe on hardened SMB/IP/RPC/NTB, and on fuzzing which
allow to spot theses kind of vulnerability very fast.
I dont believe in security by obscurity, which lead to this kind of dummy flaw.
You talk about linux; they dont have theses kind of no user interaction remote kernel panic.

What I'm trying to point out here is about 2 things:

They said new code go through stress testing,fuzzing, constant review, Bla.
It's false, and this bug proves it, it's brand new code.

The other thing is they concentrate way to much on IE and the Office suite, while SMB, IPv6, etc doesn't need any user
interaction, and are critical as they run with kernel privilege.

The point of responsible disclosure is NOT to protect MS...it's to protect the businesses that depend on MS. Yes, MS missed something huge here, but that's no reason to put this out there for the world to have 3 days in. MS isn't who will be attacked, it's other businesses that may or may not be able to control this that will pay the price. Good work, but irresponsible thought process here.

blogspot = free mister, calling Microsoft you might end up losing like 30 euro before you even come close to the person to speak with. This way you can be sure they will find out and besides that, its way better than keeping it underground and that somebody will code a nifty worm which will cause to massive amounts of viagra spam in your inbox. Once i tried to report a XSS to Microsoft through phone and i just gave up (they are still vulnerable to it today) they are like zombies moaning about if you are a customer. I would nearly say i experienced how it was to be black in the middle of a circle of KKK members (not that any other creditcard company would listen better, if you find a security leak on something like HSBC you can better just forget it, they just won’t listen to you in any way untill you post it on a blog/xssed or any other site to give it some wheels in the media.

Tout ceux qui sont à risque peuvent se protéger si ils sont déjà sous windows 7.

Maintenant si toi, tu pense que le système tel qu'il est avec ce genre de pensée unique est bon, ca ne regarde que toi, et ton nez brun, ne vas pas assumer que les autres doivent te suivre dans ce qui est un echec.

Good research... .There is STILL some problems in netbios though , in older qwindows unreported, so this is no surprise... they have never given a sh\*t about users security, look , code is out, no patch ? is a 4byte stack b0f that HARD TO PATCH ? Fuck em, i tried treporting to them also, and 3 times, they denied existence! lol... i did also hacve this with BSD security team also... the top os or, they think theyre tops, do NOT LIKE to admit, they did NOT CHECK SRC CODE! Simple as that, this should NEVER have ever gotten into a final or even close!
Great research but, unfortunately you are only helping , fellow people who CARE ABOUT ALL SECURITY not just one type... but, netbios is always and still so [piss damn easy to attack, most users, still dont use passes... or avoid using them for own reasons... so, i guess this shit will always exist, and, I bet there is a cmd exec here ;)

"And while this flaw is embarrassing for Microsoft, it's hard to see why anyone would bother to exploit it: It's only a denial of service, meaning that it locks up other computers, and it only works on the LAN, not over the Internet. So it's not good, but it's probably not a big deal. And it's not a "zero-day.""

Why don't they ever magnify issues in Linux or other products like this? SQL Server has had a little more than 10 security fixes (in 5 years!) while Oracle had over 300 in the same timeframe. Firefox accounts for 44% of browser vulnerabilities, ...

Yeh Microsoft sucks but hey, you should be more professional in your report. When you say "your vendor does not care" shows you are not subjective at all. Nice to be always a pro without any exception. Still MS sucks.

Salut Laurent. Good job! Je suis de ceux qui pense qu'il faut taper M$ là où ça fait mal, car eux se fichent pas mal d'être éthiquement correct et se contrefichent de fournir de bons produits à leurs clients. Et c'est sûrement l'un des rares moyens de faire entendre raison à ce truand qu'est M$.

En revanche, je suis un peu surpris de ton dernier commentaire où j'ai peut-être mal saisi ce que j'ai lu : "nez brun" (?). Tu t'adresses à un imbécile je comprends bien, mais tu sembles t'emporter... Tu connais le principe du point Godwin :)

Nice find. Critical or not, Microsoft needs to refine it's exploit reporting channels. Security researchers like him shouldn't have to publicly disclose this sort of stuff to get a patch released. It'd be a simple enough matter for MS to release a workaround patch for this via Windows Update. It'd be easy enough to check the system's settings for active shares, and if none exist, disable SMB until the real patch is released. If shares do exist, it would simply prompt the user after informing them of the risk level.

Damn...I didn't hear Laurent ask for anyone's advice on disclosure, his opinion of MSFT, or anything else. Why doesn't everyone who thinks they're better off not knowing about software vulnerabilities go somewhere else and stick your head in the sand?

3 days, a week, a month? Laurent doesn't work for MSFT, he doesn't owe them or you anything. This is the equivalent of noticing your car explodes if you back it into something, disclosing the fact that it happens is reality, the person who tells you before you explode has done you a favor.

You should first release it to the public and THEN contact MS.

Their way of work is really awful. Our OSes are full of stupid bugs (that remain hidded because of closed source). They don't need to triple check the code just because every security flaw is first signaled then made public.
Fuck you! YOU MUST CHECK THE CODE I'M RUNNING. I paid for it and I want it to be almost bug free.. yes.. it is not possible but such stupid bugs make me think they don't check their code at all.

A 0 day exploit like this can be a pain in terms of image. There should be more.. maybe they'll start doing things as they should!

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
