Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-3885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the parsing of BMP (Bitmap) image files within the OpenJDK. Specifically, it involves the handling of ICC (International Color Consortium) color profiles that are referenced using UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The core vulnerability is that a maliciously crafted BMP file with a UNC path in its ICC profile can trigger a denial-of-service condition.
- **Insecure Handling of UNC Paths:** The vulnerability exists because the BMP parser doesn't properly handle or sanitize UNC paths when accessing the ICC profile.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** By providing a specially crafted BMP file, an attacker can force the Java application to attempt to access a non-local file system location via UNC path, potentially leading to application unresponsiveness, excessive resource consumption, and ultimately a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted BMP File:** The primary attack vector is through a BMP image file that contains a UNC path in its ICC profile.
- **User Interaction:** An attacker would need to entice a user to process the malicious BMP file in a Java application that uses the vulnerable image parsing code. This could involve tricking a user into opening the image, or using the file as part of a larger attack chain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious BMP:** The attacker needs the capability to create a BMP file that incorporates a UNC path in the ICC profile.
- **Means of Delivery:** The attacker needs to deliver or somehow trick the user to process the crafted BMP through the vulnerable Java application. This could be through email attachments, malicious websites, or any method that allows user-driven file processing.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this issue involves preventing the parser from attempting to access the UNC paths. A patch was introduced to address this on Windows, but was a no-op on non-windows platforms.
- This vulnerability is identified as bug ID 6632445 in the Sun bug database.
- Red Hat also tracked this issue under bug ID 530114 and addressed it in RHSA-2009-1560.
