- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper authentication checks before granting access to the administration panel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain administrative access to the poll management interface without proper credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: By directly accessing the `managepoll.php` page located in the `admin` directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable application and its admin directory. No prior authentication is required.
