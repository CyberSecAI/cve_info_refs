{
  "CVE-2009-3231": {
    "description": "It was discovered that PostgreSQL did not properly perform LDAP authentication under certain circumstances. When configured to use LDAP with anonymous binds, a remote attacker could bypass authentication by supplying an empty password.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "8.3 prior to 8.3.8",
      "8.2 prior to 8.2.14"
    ],
    "root_cause": "PostgreSQL's LDAP authentication mechanism, when configured to allow anonymous binds, does not properly handle empty passwords, leading to authentication bypass.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authentication handling",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the database server.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote, over the network using an empty password when LDAP authentication is configured with anonymous binds.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the PostgreSQL server over the network and the server must be configured to use LDAP with anonymous binds.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is fixed by disallowing empty passwords during LDAP authentication."
