```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'currentPath' parameter of the 'action=chooseDirectory' request, leading to both directory traversal and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Directory Traversal: Allows access to files and directories outside the intended web server root.
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - Directory Traversal: An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, which may include configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.
  - XSS: An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing attacks, or other malicious actions.
- Attack vectors:
  - Directory Traversal: By manipulating the 'currentPath' parameter with directory traversal sequences like ".." an attacker can access unauthorized file system locations.
  - XSS: By injecting malicious javascript in the 'currentPath' parameter, an attacker can execute code in the context of the victim's browser.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
