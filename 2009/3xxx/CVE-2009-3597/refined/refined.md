{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the exposure of the 'autoconfig.dd' file which contains sensitive database configuration information.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Database credentials and configuration details are exposed due to the lack of access control or improper placement of the autoconfig.dd file within the web server's document root.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain access to the database credentials, which could lead to unauthorized access to the database, data breaches, data manipulation, and potential compromise of the entire application and server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through a direct HTTP request to the autoconfig.dd file.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker only needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable Digitaldesign CMS instance and know the path to the 'autoconfig.dd' file."
