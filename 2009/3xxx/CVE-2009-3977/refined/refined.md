**CVE-2009-3840**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The HP Openview NNM database service attempts to display an error message based on an error code provided in a network packet. However, if a negative error code other than -1 is provided, the lookup for the corresponding error message will fail, leading to a non-recoverable error and termination of the service.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of error codes received in network packets, specifically, a missing case for negative error codes other than -1, leading to an unhandled exception.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) of the internal database service, as the service will crash.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specifically crafted network packet to the database service on port 2690/tcp.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service on port 2690/tcp. No authentication is required.

Additionally, the document mentions low severity memory corruption bugs in the `ActiveDom.ocx` ActiveX control due to improper handling of long strings passed to several methods. However, these are considered low severity because the control is not marked as safe for scripting or initialization by default.
