Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Office Excel handles specially crafted Excel files containing malformed record objects. Specifically, a memory corruption occurs during the processing of these malformed objects by the `SxView` component within Excel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability that can be triggered when parsing a malformed `SxView` record.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- **Full System Control:** By executing code, the attacker can gain complete control over the affected system. This includes the ability to:
  - Install programs
  - View, change, or delete data
  - Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File-based Attack:** The attack requires the user to open a specially crafted Excel file containing the malicious record.
- **Email Attack Scenario:** An attacker can send the malicious Excel file as an email attachment and convince the user to open it.
- **Web-based Attack Scenario:** An attacker hosts the malicious Excel file on a website and convinces users to visit and open the file from the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious Excel file containing the specially crafted, malformed record object.
- The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious file to the victim, either via email, web hosting, or other file transfer mechanisms.
- No special capabilities or privileges are required on the victim's system. The vulnerability is triggered by simply opening the malicious file with a vulnerable version of Microsoft Excel.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" due to the requirement of user interaction, specifically opening a malicious document, which lowers the risk compared to vulnerabilities that can be exploited automatically without user interaction.
- Microsoft states that "users of Office XP and later editions of Office will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document" which is a mitigating factor.
- The provided documents discuss workarounds such as using the Microsoft Office File Block policy and the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE).
