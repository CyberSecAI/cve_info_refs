Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3424

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability present in multiple files within the MAXcms 3.11.20b content management system. This vulnerability arises from the insecure handling of user-supplied parameters, which are directly used in include/require statements, making it possible for an attacker to include external, malicious files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-provided input before including files. This lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to specify a remote URL, which the application then attempts to include and execute as PHP code.
- **Multiple Vulnerable Parameters:** Several parameters in various files are susceptible to this vulnerability, including:
    - `is_projectPath`
    - `GLOBALS[thCMS_root]`
    - `is_path`
    - `thCMS_root`
- **Vulnerable Files:** Numerous PHP files are vulnerable, leading to a wide attack surface. Examples include `inc.is_root.php`, `class.Tree.php`, `class.thcsm_user.php`, and many more within the `classes`, `includes`, and `modul` directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** The impact is severe as this allows a full system compromise or takeover of the server hosting the application. An attacker can gain control of the webserver and potentially pivot to other internal network resources.
- **Data Theft:** Sensitive information can be stolen from the database or configuration files.
- **Malware Deployment:** The server could be infected with malware, leading to further attacks and the use of the compromised server as part of a botnet.
- **Website Defacement:** An attacker could modify the website's content, defacing it or inserting malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable PHP files, by injecting malicious URLs via the vulnerable parameters.
    - Example: `http://localhost/[path]/includes/InstantSite/inc.is_root.php?is_projectPath=[evilc0de]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server, i.e. they need to be able to send HTTP requests to it.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication to the application.
- **Awareness of Vulnerable Paths:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable files and parameters within the application.

**Additional Notes**
The exploit-db entry provides example exploit URLs and specific vulnerable files and parameters. This information is more detailed than a basic description of Remote File Inclusion.
