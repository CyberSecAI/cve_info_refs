  "related": true,
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how browsers handle URLs, specifically how they interpret and display folder and file paths within URLs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "URL spoofing",
      "Same-origin policy bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL that appears to be from a legitimate domain, potentially leading users to believe they are interacting with a trusted website. This can be used for phishing attacks and other forms of social engineering, where users are tricked into providing sensitive information or performing actions they wouldn't otherwise do.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that uses a combination of forward slashes and other characters to misrepresent the actual domain and path.  This crafted URL is then presented to the victim, often through a link or embedded in a webpage.",
   "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to create a URL and be able to deliver it to the victim. This could be through email, social media or by hosting it on a webpage."
