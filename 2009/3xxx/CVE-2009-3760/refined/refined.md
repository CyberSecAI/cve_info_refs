{
  "CVE-2009-3760": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Citrix XenCenterWeb application suffers from poor input validation, leading to multiple vulnerabilities.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
        "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)",
        "SQL injection",
        "Remote command execution"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform various malicious actions such as executing arbitrary code, accessing sensitive data (database schema), changing user passwords, and controlling virtual machines.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Manipulating the username parameter in `edituser.php` to inject XSS.",
        "Crafting CSRF attacks to change user passwords via `changepw.php`.",
         "Using CSRF to hard stop VMs via `hardstopvm.php`.",
        "Exploiting XSS in `console.php` and `forcerestart.php`, `forcesd.php` via various parameters.",
        "Performing blind SQL injection via the `username` parameter in `login.php`.",
        "Writing arbitrary data to `/usr/local/lib/php/include/config.ini.php` via `/var/www/config/writeconfig.php` to enable remote command execution."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable XenCenterWeb application. Some attacks require the application to be running with specific PHP configurations (e.g., magic_quotes_gpc off for SQLi and remote command execution). Some attacks can be performed by a regular user, others require access to the config scripts, while others require administrative privileges. XSS can be triggered through crafted URLs and CSRF attacks can be executed from other websites or malicious links."
