| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c0)  Mark Martinec    2009-10-22 12:05:30 UTC  ``` This was a heavy battle, but I finally managed to track down the reason for perl crashes which started occurring about a week ago. The trigger was a new type of a spam message, with obfuscated text in its HTML section (using foreign (like cyrillic) characters with glyphs resembling ordinary ascii characters).  The spamassasin (command line, or spamd, or amavisd) is crashing in Mail::SpamAssassin::PerMsgStatus::_get_parsed_uri_list (called from Plugin/URIDNSBL), trying to match a wicked decoded HTML line to a heavyweight regexp $tbirdurire :        while (/$tbirdurire/igo) {  Apart from a perl bug (which should not be crashing), the incident also revealed a bug in HTML::Parser (3.62), which produced an illegal character with a huge UTF-8 code by incorrectly parsing one numerical entity in HTML.  I reported the HTML::Parser bug to Gisle Aas, and I plan to report the perl bug to the perl bug tracker.  Apart from waiting for the new versions of perl and new HTML::Parser, I wonder what can be done on SpamAssassin to work around the trouble. Reinventing HTML decoding by ourselves is not appealing, and checking decoded utf-8 string validity is likely to be prohibitively slow. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c1)  Mark Martinec    2009-10-22 12:51:47 UTC  ``` Reported to perlbug, assigned a tracker id: [perl #69973] ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c2)  Mark Martinec    2009-10-22 15:49:05 UTC  ``` > I reported the HTML::Parser bug to Gisle Aas  Awesome, Gisle Aas already provided the fix and uploaded an updated version HTML-Parser-3.6 :  <http://github.com/gisle/html-parser/>   commit/b9aae1e43eb2c8e989510187cff0ba3e996f9a4c  <http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/G/GA/GAAS/HTML-Parser-3.63.tar.gz> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c3)  Warren Togami    2009-10-23 12:57:41 UTC  ``` <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/10/23/8> CVE-2009-3626 perl-5.10.1 Effects only perl-5.10.1, but apparently not perl-5.8.0, perl-5.8.5, perl-5.8.8, perl-5.10.0.  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/10/23/9> CVE-2009-3627 HTML-Parser-3.63 All versions prior to HTML::Parser 3.63 are effected. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c4)  Mark Martinec    2009-10-23 15:59:52 UTC  ``` > Effects only perl-5.10.1, but apparently not perl-5.8.0, perl-5.8.5, > perl-5.8.8, perl-5.10.0.  Thanks for investigating with other versions.   > <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/10/23/9> >   CVE-2009-3627 HTML-Parser-3.63 > All versions prior to HTML::Parser 3.63 are effected. > > Mark Martinec reported a denial of service flaw ((infinite loop), > present in HTML-Parser in versions prior to 3.63,  while parsing > HTML entity with invalid UTF-8 character.  Just to make it clear: not to be confused, there are two independent problems here.  1. The crashing flaw is in a perl 5.10.1 regex evaluation, which is being investigated. A problem in HTML::Parser facilitates triggering that perl bug, but that perl crash could occur even with fixed HTML::Parser (just needs more malicious mail text), or even without that module;  2. Jan iankko Lieskovsky of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered that the HTML::Parser bug could itself cause an infinite loop, regardless of the perl regexp bug. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c5)  Mark Martinec    2009-10-23 16:40:35 UTC  ``` > 2. Jan iankko Lieskovsky of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered > that the HTML::Parser bug could itself cause an infinite loop, regardless > of the perl regexp bug.  P.S.: This second item is still being investigated. It may not be independent, could just be another manifestation of the same perl regexp utf8 bug. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c6)  Mark Martinec    2009-10-25 16:29:52 UTC  ``` The perl bug has been resolved now, see:    <http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=69973>  The problem and its resolution may have an impact on our choice of combining utf8 with non-utf8 strings vs. regexp. In particular, see the last paragraph:   > Resolved by: > > commit 0abd0d78a73da1c4d13b1c700526b7e5d03b32d4 > Author: Yves Orton <demerphq at gmail.com> > Date: Sun Oct 25 20:37:08 2009 +0100 > > disable non-unicode case insensitive trie matching > > Also revert 8902bb05b18c9858efa90229ca1ee42b17277554 as it merely > masked one symptom of the deeper problems. > > Also fixes RT #69973, which was a segfault which was exposed by > 8902bb05, see the ticket for further details. > > <http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=69973> > > At the core of this is the problem that in unicode matching a bunch > of code points have case folding rules beyond just A-Z/a-z. Since > the case folding rules are decided at runtime by the string, we can't > use the same TRIE tables for both unicode/non-unicode matching. > > Until this is reconciled or some other solution is found case > insensitive matching only gets the TRIE optimisation when the pattern > is unicode. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c7)  Mark Martinec    2009-11-09 11:46:58 UTC  ```   [Bug 6225](show_bug.cgi?id=6225 "RESOLVED FIXED - Invalid numerical HTML entity crashes perl"): untaint the string in an attempt to work around   a perl crash - a workaround for [perl #69973] bug:     Invalid and tainted utf-8 char crashes perl 5.10.1 in regexp evaluation   A regexp and a string should both be utf8, or none of them;   untainting string also seems to avoid the crash. Sending lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm Committed [revision 834191](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=834191). ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c8)  Mark Martinec    2009-11-11 10:14:42 UTC  ``` Preventively local()-ize $1 in a couple of places in PerMsgStatus in view of in view of [perl #67962] Sending lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/PerMsgStatus.pm Committed [revision 834996](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=834996). ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c9)  Mark Martinec    2009-11-11 10:28:08 UTC  ``` The workaround in [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c7) seems to avoid the immediate threat, so I'm closing this bug. The HTML::Parser issue is a bug alright, but is a minor concern to SpamAssassin, apart from facilitating triggering of the perl 5.10.1 bug (which we now avoid).  The concern of a disabled TRIE optimisation in perl when the pattern is not unicode has potential impact on our rule matching, but this is something hard to solve in the regexp-heavy SpamAssassin. If this is to be discussed, another PR should be opened. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c10)  Mark Martinec    2009-11-18 12:51:52 UTC  ``` See also [Bug 6238](show_bug.cgi?id=6238 "RESOLVED FIXED"). ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c11)  Mark Martinec    2009-11-23 07:40:20 UTC  ``` See also [bug 6240](show_bug.cgi?id=6240 "RESOLVED FIXED - Perl crashing on extracting URIs from a mail body"), the perl crash there happens in the same spot in _get_parsed_uri_list, but possibly for a different reason. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=6225#c12)  Tom Schulz    2009-11-23 11:51:39 UTC  ``` Perhaps it would be better if Spamassassin would refuse to run with the bad version of Perl. You probably can not find all the places where you could trigger that bug. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=530604#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-10-23 17:42:56 UTC  ``` Originally Mark Martinec reported the following issue to be present in  HTML-Parser: [1] <http://github.com/gisle/html-parser/commit/b9aae1e43eb2c8e989510187cff0ba3e996f9a4c>  After preliminary analysis we concluded this results in: --------------------------------------------------------- A denial of service flaw was found in the way HTML-Parser used to decode certain HTML entities. A remote attacker  could provide a specially-crafted string (containing HTML entities) leading to infinite loop, when processed by the parser.  But further, more detailed analysis of the issue confirmed there is no additional, separated security issue (to [CVE-2009-3626](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3626)) present in HTML-Parser. While [1] is still bug, it only "helps" to expose the consequences of:  <http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=69973> <http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commit/0abd0d78a73da1c4d13b1c700526b7e5d03b32d4> <http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Attachment/617489/295383/>  in more quicker way, and doesn't impersonate security issue in HTML-Parser itself.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=530604#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-10-23 17:46:24 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the perl-HTML-Parser package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.  This issue affects the versions of the perl-HTML-Parser package, as shipped with Fedora releases of 10 and 11, and as scheduled to appear in Fedora release of 12.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=530604#c8)  Vincent Danen    2009-11-13 15:35:53 UTC  ``` Red Hat does not believe this is a direct security issue.  This flaw can only lead to a crash if perl-HTML-Parser is used in conjunction with perl 5.10.1, which is not used in any supported version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  If used with any earlier version of perl, this flaw only leads to garbage output; there is no infinite loop that would cause a denial of service condition.  The real issue here is [CVE-2009-3626](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3626), which affects only perl 5.10.1.   ``` |  |

Mark Martinec reported crashed when running SpamAssassin, given a
particular HTML junk mail to parse.  The problem was caused by
HTML::Parsers decode_entities function confusing itself when it
encountered strings with incomplete entities at the end of the string.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.
