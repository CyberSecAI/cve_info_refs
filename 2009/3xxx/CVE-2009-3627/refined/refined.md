{
  "CVE-2009-3627": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability lies within the HTML::Parser module, specifically in how it handles HTML entities. When the parser encounters a numerical HTML entity containing an invalid UTF-8 character, it can lead to an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service. This occurs because the parser does not correctly handle the invalid character, causing it to loop indefinitely while trying to process the malformed entity.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause is the incorrect parsing of numerical HTML entities containing invalid UTF-8 characters within the `decode_entities` function of the HTML::Parser module.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of invalid UTF-8 characters within numerical HTML entities.",
      "Lack of proper bounds checking or input validation when processing HTML entities.",
      "Vulnerability to infinite loop due to incorrect processing of malformed input."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by sending a specially crafted string containing malformed HTML entities to a service using the vulnerable HTML::Parser module. This can result in the application becoming unresponsive or crashing due to an infinite loop.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted HTML strings containing malformed numeric entities.",
       "This can be achieved via email body or other sources of HTML input processed by vulnerable services."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send an input that is processed by the vulnerable HTML::Parser module.  The attacker does not require any special privileges."
