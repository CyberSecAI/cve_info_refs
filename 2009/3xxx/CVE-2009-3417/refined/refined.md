```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The idoblog component for Joomla! is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the "userid" parameter.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and password hashes. This could lead to unauthorized access and further compromise of the system.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL with a specific "userid" parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! installation.
