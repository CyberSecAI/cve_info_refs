Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3984:

**1. Verification of Relevance**

The provided content directly references CVE-2009-3984 in multiple sources, including Mozilla's security advisory and Red Hat's bug tracker. The descriptions also align with the official CVE description: "Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey do not properly display SSL indicators under certain circumstances, which allows remote attackers to spoof an encrypted page via a crafted page that sets document.location to a https URL that returns a 204 status and no response body."

**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey handle `document.location` changes when navigating to an HTTPS URL that responds with a 204 status code (No Content) and an empty response body.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The browser's UI incorrectly displays SSL indicators (such as a padlock icon) when an insecure page sets its `document.location` to a specially crafted HTTPS URL with 204 response, leading to a false sense of security.
    *   The insecure page will retain its content but display SSL indicators as if it were a secure page, even though the page content has not been loaded over a secure connection.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Spoofing:** An attacker can create a malicious webpage that appears to be secure, tricking users into believing they are interacting with a legitimate, secure site, which could facilitate phishing attacks.
    *   Users are shown SSL indicators even when they are not on a secure site. This can cause them to enter sensitive information into the page when they would not have otherwise done so.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker hosts an HTML page loaded over an insecure protocol (http: or file:).
    *   The malicious page uses JavaScript to set `document.location` to a specially-crafted HTTPS URL which responds with a 204 status and empty body.
    *   The user visits this malicious page using a vulnerable browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to host a web page that can be visited by the targeted users.
    *   The attacker needs to know how to craft an HTTPS URL that returns a 204 status and empty response body or be able to host such a server.
    *   The attacker does not require any specific system access or authentication.

**3. Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability occurs because the browser's security UI incorrectly handles the `onSecurityChange` event when loading a page that returns a 204 status code with an empty body after setting `document.location`.
*   The issue was introduced by changes in `nsDocLoader.cpp` that used the `STATE_TRANSFERRING` flag to inform the security UI.
*   The fix involves making the security UI ignore 204/205 responses for document loads and clearing `mFailedURI` and `mFailedChannel` variables on error pages.

**4. Additional Details**
*   Red Hat identified this vulnerability and released fixes for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5, and derivatives.
*   Mozilla released a fix in Firefox 3.0.16, 3.5.6, and SeaMonkey 2.0.1.
*   This is similar to another URL spoofing vulnerability, CVE-2009-3985, which involves an invalid URL and injecting content into a blank page.
*   The vulnerability is easily reproducible via a javascript `document.location` call.

In summary, CVE-2009-3984 is a spoofing vulnerability that affects Firefox and SeaMonkey and allows attackers to mislead users into believing they are on a secure page when they are not, through the use of a crafted HTTPS URL.
