  "CVE-2009-3605": {
    "description": "Multiple integer overflows in Poppler 0.10.5 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file, related to (1) glib/poppler-page.cc; (2) ArthurOutputDev.cc, (3) CairoOutputDev.cc, (4) GfxState.cc, (5) JBIG2Stream.cc, (6) PSOutputDev.cc, and (7) SplashOutputDev.cc in poppler/; and (8) SplashBitmap.cc, (9) Splash.cc, and (10) SplashFTFont.cc in splash/. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2009-0791.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the usage of `gmalloc` with an integer argument which is the product of two or more values, and these values are read from the PDF input file without sufficient validation. If one or more of these values is large, the multiplication will result in an integer overflow, and `gmalloc` will allocate a smaller buffer than required, leading to heap-based buffer overflows.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service (application crash) or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the program.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted PDF file"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file with specific values to trigger integer overflows within memory allocation routines of the Poppler library."
