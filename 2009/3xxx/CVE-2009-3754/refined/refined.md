This content provides details on multiple vulnerabilities in phpbms v0.96, including SQL injection, persistent cross-site scripting (pXSS), and path disclosure. While it mentions CVE-2009-3754, it does not specify which vulnerability corresponds to that CVE. It does, however, give proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for each vulnerability, making it more detailed than a simple CVE description.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized user input in multiple files:
        *   `modules/bms/invoices_discount_ajax.php` using the `id` parameter.
        *   `dbgraphic.php` using `f`, `mf`, `t`, and `r` parameters.
        *   `advancedsearch.php` using the `cmd`, `tid`, and `base` parameters when `cmd` is set to "show".
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and direct use of user-supplied parameters in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL query execution, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted HTTP GET requests with malicious SQL payloads in the vulnerable parameters.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

2.  **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (pXSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Inadequate output sanitization of user-controlled input in several PHP files using the `action` attribute of HTML form elements.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper sanitization of form action URLs leading to JavaScript execution within the context of the application.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted URLs injected into the `action` attribute of HTML forms.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker can craft malicious URLs that will be stored and executed when a user interacts with the application.

3.  **Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Error messages or default information output reveals server-side paths.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper error handling and default configurations expose sensitive file system paths.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of potentially sensitive server-side information, which can be used to aid other attacks.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Direct access of certain files or specific requests to vulnerable pages, like footer.php, header.php, advancedsearch.php or choicelist.php
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote attacker can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
