{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2009-3556",
    "Root cause": "The qla2xxx driver, when N\_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) hardware is used, creates two sysfs pseudo files, `/sys/class/scsi_host/[a qla2xxx host]/vport_create` and `vport_delete`, with world-writable permissions by default.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect file permissions on sysfs pseudo files.",
      "World-writable permissions on files controlling SCSI host attributes."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can make arbitrary changes to SCSI host attributes by modifying the world-writable files.",
    "Attack vector": "Local access to the system is required to modify the file.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to be a local user to modify the files. No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability."
