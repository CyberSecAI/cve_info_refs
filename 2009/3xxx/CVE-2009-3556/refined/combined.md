1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update fixes lots of bugs and some security issues in the SUSE
Linux Enterprise 10 SP 3 kernel.
CVE-2009-4020: Stack-based buffer overflow in the hfs subsystem in the
Linux kernel allows remote attackers to have an unspecified impact
via a crafted Hierarchical File System (HFS) filesystem, related to
the hfs\_readdir function in fs/hfs/dir.c.
CVE-2010-0410: drivers/connector/connector.c in the Linux kernel
allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and
system crash) by sending the kernel many NETLINK\_CONNECTOR messages.
CVE-2009-3556: A configuration value in the qla2xxx driver in the
Linux kernel when N\_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV) hardware is used,
sets world-writable permissions for the (1) vport\_create and (2)
vport\_delete files under /sys/class/scsi\_host/, which allows local
users to make arbitrary changes to SCSI host attributes by modifying
these files.
CVE-2010-1083: A kernel information leak using user space USB devices
could be used by local attackers with USB access to read recently
freed kernel memory.
CVE-2010-1086: A ULE decapsulation denial of service problem in DVB
drivers was fixed that could be triggered by invalid DVB data packets.
CVE-2010-1088: A NFS denial of service by following "automount"
symlinks was fixed.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Subject: CVE-2009-3556 kernel: qla2xxx NPIV vport management pseudofiles are
 world writable

As far as I know, this only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The RHBA-2008:0314 update introduced N_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV)
support in the qla2xxx driver, resulting in two new sysfs pseudo files,
"/sys/class/scsi_host/[a qla2xxx host]/vport_create" and "vport_delete".
These two files were world-writable by default, allowing a local user to
change SCSI host attributes. This flaw only affects systems using the
qla2xxx driver and NPIV capable hardware.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2009-3556>

Thanks, Eugene

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=537177#c0)  Bryn M. Reeves    2009-11-12 18:10:10 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The qla2xxx driver now supports NPIV which adds two new sysfs pseduofiles to the SCSI host attributes:  w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_create w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_delete w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_create w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_delete    These file default to world writable (S_IWUGO/0222). Upstream uses S_IWUSR (0644) for these files although they've moved around a bit - the equivalent attributes are created from drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_fc.c now.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 2.6.18-63.el5 onwards  How reproducible: 100% on systems that loads qla2xxx on NPIV capable hardware.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/<a qla2xxx host>/vport_*    ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/<a qla2xxx host>/vport_id    ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/<a qla2xxx host>/vport_disable    ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/<a qla2xxx host>/symbolic_port_name  Actual results: --w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_create --w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_delete --w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_create --w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_delete etc.  Expected results: -rw-r--r-- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_create -rw-r--r-- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_delete -rw-r--r-- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_create -rw-r--r-- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_delete etc.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=537177#c1)  Bryn M.

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* an array index error was found in the gdth driver. A local user could

send a specially-crafted IOCTL request that would cause a denial of service
or, possibly, privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3080, Important)

* a flaw was found in the FUSE implementation. When a system is low on

memory, fuse\_put\_request() could dereference an invalid pointer, possibly
leading to a local denial of service or privilege escalation.
(CVE-2009-4021, Important)

* Tavis Ormandy discovered a deficiency in the fasync\_helper()

implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to leverage a
use-after-free of locked, asynchronous file descriptors to cause a denial
of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-4141, Important)

* the Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team reported the RHSA-2009:1243

update introduced two flaws in the routing implementation. If an attacker
was able to cause a large enough number of collisions in the routing hash
table (via specially-crafted packets) for the emergency route flush to
trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if the kernel routing cache was
disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be left behind after a route
lookup, leading to a kernel panic. (CVE-2009-4272, Important)

* the RHSA-2009:0225 update introduced a rewrite attack flaw in the

do\_coredump() function. A local attacker able to guess the file name a
process is going to dump its core to, prior to the process crashing, could
use this flaw to append data to the dumped core file. This issue only
affects systems that have "/proc/sys/fs/suid\_dumpable" set to 2 (the
default value is 0). (CVE-2006-6304, Moderate)

The fix for CVE-2006-6304 changes the expected behavior: With suid\_dumpable
set to 2, the core file will not be recorded if the file already exists.
For example, core files will not be overwritten on subsequent crashes of
processes whose core files map to the same name.

* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,

32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. (CVE-2009-2910, Moderate)

* the RHBA-2008:0314 update introduced N\_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV)

support in the qla2xxx driver, resulting in two new sysfs pseudo files,
"/sys/class/scsi\_host/[a qla2xxx host]/vport\_create" and "vport\_delete".
These two files were world-writable by default, allowing a local user to
change SCSI host attributes. This flaw only affects systems using the
qla2xxx driver and NPIV capable hardware. (CVE-2009-3556, Moderate)

* permission issues were found in the megaraid\_sas driver. The "dbg\_lvl"

and "poll\_mode\_io" files on the sysfs file system ("/sys/") had
world-writable permissions. This could allow local, unprivileged users to
change the behavior of the driver. (CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, Moderate)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the firewire-ohci driver

used for OHCI compliant IEEE 1394 controllers. A local, unprivileged user
with access to /dev/fw\* files could issue certain IOCTL calls, causing a
denial of service or privilege escalation. The FireWire modules are
blacklisted by default, and if enabled, only root has access to the files
noted above by default. (CVE-2009-4138, Moderate)

* a buffer overflow flaw was found in the hfs\_bnode\_read() function in the

HFS file system implementation. This could lead to a denial of service if a
user browsed a specially-crafted HFS file system, for example, by running
"ls". (CVE-2009-4020, Low)

Bug fix documentation for this update will be available shortly from
www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/errata/RHSA-2010-0046/Kernel\_Security\_Update/
index.html

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

kernel security and bug fix update (RHSA-2010-0046)

Original Release Date: February 3, 2010

Last Revised: November 4, 2010

Number: ASA-2010-026

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

\* an array index error was found in the gdth driver. A local user could
send a specially-crafted IOCTL request that would cause a denial of service
or, possibly, privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3080](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3080.html) to this issue.

\* a flaw was found in the FUSE implementation. When a system is low on
memory, fuse\_put\_request() could dereference an invalid pointer, possibly
leading to a local denial of service or privilege escalation.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4021](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4021.html) to this issue.

\* a deficiency was discovered in the fasync\_helper()
implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to leverage a
use-after-free of locked, asynchronous file descriptors to cause a denial
of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4141](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4141.html) to this issue.

\* it was reported that the [RHSA-2009:1243](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1243.html)
update introduced two flaws in the routing implementation. If an attacker
was able to cause a large enough number of collisions in the routing hash
table (via specially-crafted packets) for the emergency route flush to
trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if the kernel routing cache was
disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be left behind after a route
lookup, leading to a kernel panic. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4272](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4272.html) to this issue.

\* the [RHSA-2009:0225](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0225.html) update introduced a rewrite attack flaw in the
do\_coredump() function. A local attacker able to guess the file name a
process is going to dump its core to, prior to the process crashing, could
use this flaw to append data to the dumped core file. This issue only
affects systems that have "/proc/sys/fs/suid\_dumpable" set to 2 (the
default value is 0). The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2006-6304](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2006-6304.html) to this issue.

The fix for [CVE-2006-6304](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2006-6304.html) changes the expected behavior: With suid\_dumpable
set to 2, the core file will not be recorded if the file already exists.
For example, core files will not be overwritten on subsequent crashes of
processes whose core files map to the same name.

\* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,
32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-2910](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-2910.html) to this issue.

\* the [RHBA-2008:0314](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2008-0314.html) update introduced N\_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV)
support in the qla2xxx driver, resulting in two new sysfs pseudo files,
"/sys/class/scsi\_host/[a qla2xxx host]/vport\_create" and "vport\_delete".
These two files were world-writable by default, allowing a local user to
change SCSI host attributes. This flaw only affects systems using the
qla2xxx driver and NPIV capable hardware. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3556](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3556.html) to this issue.

\* permission issues were found in the megaraid\_sas driver. The "dbg\_lvl"
and "poll\_mode\_io" files on the sysfs file system ("/sys/") had
world-writable permissions. This could allow local, unprivileged users to
change the behavior of the driver. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2009-3889](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3889.html) and [CVE-2009-3939](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3939.html) to these issues.

\* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the firewire-ohci driver
used for OHCI compliant IEEE 1394 controllers. A local, unprivileged user
with access to /dev/fw\* files could issue certain IOCTL calls, causing a
denial of service or privilege escalation. The FireWire modules are
blacklisted by default, and if enabled, only root has access to the files
noted above by default. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4138](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4138.html) to this issue.

\* a buffer overflow flaw was found in the hfs\_bnode\_read() function in the
HFS file system implementation. This could lead to a denial of service if a
user browsed a specially-crafted HFS file system, for example, by running
"ls". The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4020](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4020.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=537177#c0)  Bryn M. Reeves    2009-11-12 18:10:10 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The qla2xxx driver now supports NPIV which adds two new sysfs pseduofiles to the SCSI host attributes:  w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_create w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_delete w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_create w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_delete    These file default to world writable (S_IWUGO/0222). Upstream uses S_IWUSR (0644) for these files although they've moved around a bit - the equivalent attributes are created from drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_fc.c now.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 2.6.18-63.el5 onwards  How reproducible: 100% on systems that loads qla2xxx on NPIV capable hardware.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/<a qla2xxx host>/vport_*    ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/<a qla2xxx host>/vport_id    ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/<a qla2xxx host>/vport_disable    ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/<a qla2xxx host>/symbolic_port_name  Actual results: --w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_create --w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_delete --w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_create --w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_delete etc.  Expected results: -rw-r--r-- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_create -rw-r--r-- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_delete -rw-r--r-- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_create -rw-r--r-- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_delete etc.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=537177#c1)  Bryn M. Reeves    2009-11-12 18:12:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 369281](attachment.cgi?id=369281&action=diff "Change sysfs permissions from 0222 to 0644 for a bunch of qla2xxx sysfs files") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=369281&action=edit "Change sysfs permissions from 0222 to 0644 for a bunch of qla2xxx sysfs files") Change sysfs permissions from 0222 to 0644 for a bunch of qla2xxx sysfs files  Smoke tested by me but I have no NPIV-capable hardware here to test properly.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=537177#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-01-19 23:37:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0046 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0046.html>   ``` |  |

RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

# RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes security issues and several
bugs is now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
(RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the IPv6 Extension Header (EH) handling
implementation in the Linux kernel. The skb->dst data structure was not
properly validated in the ipv6\_hop\_jumbo() function. This could possibly
lead to a remote denial of service. (CVE-2007-4567)

The Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team reported two flaws in the routing
implementation. If an attacker was able to cause a large enough number of
collisions in the routing hash table (via specially-crafted packets) for
the emergency route flush to trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if
the kernel routing cache was disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be
left behind after a route lookup, leading to a kernel panic.
(CVE-2009-4272)

A flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in
the Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using packets larger
than the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in
partial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws
could also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.
(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538)

A flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel.
Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network cards
supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of
service. (CVE-2009-4537)

The x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current
Privilege Level (CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL). A user in a guest
could leverage these flaws to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or
possibly escalate their privileges within that guest. (CVE-2010-0298,
CVE-2010-0306)

A flaw was found in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation. Access
to the internal data structure pit\_state, which represents the data state
of the emulated PIT, was not properly validated in the pit\_ioport\_read()
function. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2010-0309)

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2006-6304, CVE-2009-2910,
CVE-2009-3080, CVE-2009-3556, CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, CVE-2009-4020,
CVE-2009-4021, CVE-2009-4138, and CVE-2009-4141; ntp issue CVE-2009-3563;
dbus issue CVE-2009-1189; dnsmasq issues CVE-2009-2957 and CVE-2009-2958;
gnutls issue CVE-2009-2730; krb5 issue CVE-2009-4212; bind issue
CVE-2010-0097; gzip issue CVE-2010-0001; openssl issues CVE-2009-2409 and
CVE-2009-4355; and gcc issue CVE-2009-3736.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* on systems with a large number of disk devices, USB storage devices may

get enumerated after "/dev/sdz", for example, "/dev/sdcd". This was not
handled by the udev rules, resulting in a missing "/dev/live" symbolic
link, causing installations from USB media to fail. With this update, udev
rules correctly handle USB storage devices on systems with a large number
of disk devices, which resolves this issue. (BZ#555083)

As RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from the KVM update
RHSA-2010:0088 have been included in this update:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0088.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=537177#c0)  Bryn M. Reeves    2009-11-12 18:10:10 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The qla2xxx driver now supports NPIV which adds two new sysfs pseduofiles to the SCSI host attributes:  w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_create w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_delete w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_create w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_delete    These file default to world writable (S_IWUGO/0222). Upstream uses S_IWUSR (0644) for these files although they've moved around a bit - the equivalent attributes are created from drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_fc.c now.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 2.6.18-63.el5 onwards  How reproducible: 100% on systems that loads qla2xxx on NPIV capable hardware.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/<a qla2xxx host>/vport_*    ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/<a qla2xxx host>/vport_id    ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/<a qla2xxx host>/vport_disable    ls -l /sys/class/scsi_host/<a qla2xxx host>/symbolic_port_name  Actual results: --w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_create --w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_delete --w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_create --w--w--w- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_delete etc.  Expected results: -rw-r--r-- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_create -rw-r--r-- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host1/vport_delete -rw-r--r-- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_create -rw-r--r-- root root  /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/vport_delete etc.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=537177#c1)  Bryn M.

The necessary fix was included in 2.6.19.1 and versions prior to that are vulnerable.  Thus RHEL5 is affected.     This vulnerability could allow a local attacker to modify certain files during a core dump.  According to [1] there are no known exploits of this bug.  So there should be no need to implement a workaround.  However the vulnerability does exist in RHEL5 and so we should include the fix.  I'd also like to receive confirmation from engineering, however I am fairly confident in my findings/analysis.  ~dmaley  [1] <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21591/exploit>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c3)  Dave Anderson    2009-12-02 14:19:16 UTC  ``` > I'd also like to receive confirmation from engineering, however I am fairly > confident in my findings/analysis.  Certainly the bug exists in RHEL5 -- is that what you're asking for confirmation?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c4)  Dave Maley    2009-12-02 17:00:38 UTC  ``` > Certainly the bug exists in RHEL5 -- is that what you're asking for > confirmation?  yes, but also that there's no apparent risk associated for which we should be providing guidance/workarounds?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c5)  Dave Anderson    2009-12-02 18:52:35 UTC  ``` I have no idea.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c6)  Dave Maley    2009-12-03 20:59:02 UTC  ``` OK then since there's a CVE assigned and the actual risks are unclear I'm adding the "Security" keyword.  If there's something more/else I should do to ensure the security folks are made aware pls let me know.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c13)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-12-04 06:17:14 UTC  ``` This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 when it was first reported back in 2006 with [CVE-2006-6304](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-6304). However, the issue was introduced last July 2008 with a patch for "[misc] pipe support to /proc/sys/net/core_pattern".  In the do_coredump() function, the flag is only set (to O_EXCL) if mm->dumpable is 2.  fs/exec.c:         /*          *      We cannot trust fsuid as being the "true" uid of the          *      process nor do we know its entire history. We only know it          *      was tainted so we dump it as root in mode 2.          */          if (mm->dumpable == 2)          /* Setuid core dump mode */         {                 flag = O_EXCL;          /* Stop rewrite attacks */                 current->fsuid = 0;     /* Dump root private */         }         mm->dumpable = 0;  "And then filp_open follows with "flag" totally ignored."  Note that this issue only matters if dumpable is set to 2. The default is 0.  See man 5 proc: /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable (since Linux 2.6.13) The value in this file determines whether core dump files are produced for set-user-ID or otherwise protected/tainted binaries. Three different integer values can be specified: [...] 2 ("suidsafe") Any binary which normally would not be dumped (see "0" above) is dumped readable by root only. This allows the user to remove the core dump file but not to read it. For security reasons core dumps in this mode will not overwrite one another or other files. This mode is appropriate when administrators are attempting to debug problems in a normal environment.  Ensure that suid_dumpable is always set to 0.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c14)  Neil Horman    2009-12-04 16:40:52 UTC  ``` So, I'm reviewing this, and while clearly its a good patch to take on priciple, I really don't think the impact of this bug warrants  zstream release. By omitting O_EXCL, we simply inform the the kernel that it shold fail if the attempted file creation already exists.  By not doing that, we simply offer an attacker the opportunity to append data to a core file (by guesssing the file name and creating a very large file (larger than the core), prior to crashing the prcoess whos core will map to that same name.  Potentially irritating, yes, but certainly not serious from a security standpoint.  I get putting it in 5.5, but do we really need to crack open 5.4.z for this?   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c15)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-12-07 03:00:40 UTC  ``` As discussed last week, we will fix this in 5.4.z.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=537273#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-01-19 23:37:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0046 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0046.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
