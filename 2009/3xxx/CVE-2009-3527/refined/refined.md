- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A race condition exists in the pipe close() code related to kqueues.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free vulnerability in kernel memory. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to local kernel privilege escalation, kernel data corruption, and/or a system crash.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the system to run code.
