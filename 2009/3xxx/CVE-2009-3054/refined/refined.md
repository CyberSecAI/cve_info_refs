Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3054

**Root Cause:** The `com_artportal` component in Joomla! is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `portalid` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code into the `portalid` parameter. Both standard and blind SQL injection techniques are demonstrated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - An attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored in the database.
  - An attacker can potentially modify or delete data.
  - An attacker can potentially gain control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `portalid` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla! installation.
   - The attacker does not need any special privileges or credentials.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit examples provided include:
  - **Union-based SQL injection:**
    - `http://www.site.com/index.php?option=com_artportal&portalid=1 union all select 1,2,3,4,5,6,version(),8,9--`
  - **Blind SQL injection:**
    - `http://www.site.com/index.php?option=com_artportal&portalid=1 and 1=2` (False)
    - `http://www.site.com/index.php?option=com_artportal&portalid=1 and 1=1` (True)
    - `http://www.site.com/index.php?option=com_artportal&portalid=1 and substring(@@version,1,1)=4` (False)
    - `http://www.site.com/index.php?option=com_artportal&portalid=1 and substring(@@version,1,1)=5` (True)

This exploit allows attackers to read the database version, and the use of blind SQL injection techniques enables extracting more information even without seeing the output of SQL queries directly.
