Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3063

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw present in the `com_gameserver` component of Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter, before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
- Possible Privilege Escalation: Depending on the database user's privileges used by the application, an attacker may gain further access to the database system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The `id` parameter of the `com_gameserver` component's `gamepanel` view is vulnerable.
- Malicious SQL Injection payload injected into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs knowledge of basic SQL injection syntax.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit example provided demonstrates how to use `UNION SELECT` to retrieve data from the `jos_users` table, specifically username and password hashes.

**Vulnerable Component:**
- Joomla Component: com_gameserver 1.0

**Vulnerable Parameter:**
-  `id` parameter within `index.php?option=com_gameserver&view=gamepanel`

**Exploit Example:**
```
http://127.0.0.1/[path]/index.php?option=com_gameserver&view=gamepanel&id=999999/**/and/**/1=2/**/union/**/select/**/group_concat(username,char(58),password)v3n0m/**/from/**/jos_users--
