CVE-2009-3241:
```

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is within the OPC UA dissector in Wireshark. Specifically, malformed packets could trigger excessive CPU and memory usage or cause the application to crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):**  Malformed packets processed by the OpcUA dissector could lead to excessive CPU and memory usage, effectively causing a denial of service.
*   **Crash:** The OpcUA dissector could crash when parsing certain malformed packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful attack would cause Wireshark to become unresponsive or crash, preventing network analysis.
*   If this is done via a capture file provided by an attacker, it could disrupt an analysis session
*   In a live capture scenario, a malicious network traffic stream could cause the analyst's instance of wireshark to crash or become unstable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Packet Injection:** An attacker could craft malformed OPC UA packets and inject them into a network traffic stream being analyzed by Wireshark.
*   **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker could create a malicious capture file containing malformed OPC UA packets and convince a user to open it with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send or provide malformed OPC UA packets to a system running a vulnerable version of Wireshark. This could be done either by being on the same network or by providing a malicious capture file.
*   No specific privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Wireshark versions 0.99.6 to 1.0.8, 1.2.0 to 1.2.1.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Wireshark version 1.2.2 or later.
*   As a workaround, the OpcUa dissector can be disabled through the Analyze -> Enabled Protocols menu.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is also referenced in the context of SUSE and Debian security advisories, indicating its impact across different operating systems.
*   Wireshark's security advisory references this as one of multiple vulnerabilities fixed in release 1.2.2
