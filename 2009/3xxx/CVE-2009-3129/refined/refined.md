  "CVE-2009-3129": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office Excel handles specially crafted Excel files that include a malformed record object. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption issue that occurs while parsing a malformed FEATHEADER record within a specially crafted Excel file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to improper handling of the `cbHdrData` size element within the FEATHEADER record, leading to a controllable pointer offset.",
      "Insufficient validation of input data, leading to a buffer overflow when opening a specially crafted Excel file."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution, gaining complete control of the affected system with the privileges of the logged-on user. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, data theft, modification, or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by convincing a user to open a specially crafted Excel file. This could be delivered via email or a website hosting the malicious file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious Excel file to the victim and convince them to open it. No special capabilities or position within the network are needed beyond that."
