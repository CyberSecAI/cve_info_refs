  "vulnerability_1": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2009-3263",
    "root_cause": "The browser rendered RSS and Atom feeds as XML. Some websites did not sanitize their feeds for active content, such as JavaScript.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper sanitization of RSS and Atom feeds",
      "Rendering of application/rss+xml content as active content"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject JavaScript into a target website by exploiting the lack of sanitization in RSS or Atom feeds.",
    "attack_vector": "The victim visits a page under the attacker's control, which contains a malicious RSS or Atom feed that will be rendered by the browser with active content enabled. The malicious feed is hosted on a target website that does not sanitize its feeds.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a website that can serve a malicious RSS or Atom feed. They also need to be able to inject JavaScript into an RSS or Atom feed that will be consumed by the victim's browser."

   "vulnerability_2": {
        "cve_id": "CVE-2009-3263",
        "root_cause": "The getSVGDocument method lacked an access check, resulting in a cross-origin JavaScript capability leak.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Same Origin Policy Bypass",
            "Missing access check in getSVGDocument method"
        ],
        "impact": "A malicious website could use the leaked capability to inject JavaScript into a target website hosting an SVG document, bypassing the same-origin policy.",
        "attack_vector": "The victim visits a page under an attacker's control. The target website needs to host an SVG document.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a website and needs a target website hosting an SVG document."
