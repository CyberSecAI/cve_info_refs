# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-067 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Excel Could Allow Remote Code Execution (972652)

Published: November 10, 2009

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Excel. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Office Excel 2002, Microsoft Office Excel 2003, Microsoft Office Excel 2007, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, and Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; and all supported versions of Microsoft Office Excel Viewer and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Excel opens and parses Excel files, and by modifying the way that Excel handles malformed records. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 972652](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/972652) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**What are the known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update?**

[Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 972652](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/972652) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

**Does this update contain any non-security related changes to functionality?**

Yes. After this security update is installed, if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file, Excel may exit unexpectedly but the vulnerabilities addressed in this update will not be exploitable.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**What components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats are updated by this bulletin?**

The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin.

**What is the Microsoft Office Excel Viewer?**

The Microsoft Office Excel Viewer is a replacement for all previous Excel Viewer versions, including Excel Viewer 97 and Excel Viewer 2003. With Excel Viewer, you can open, view, and print Excel workbooks, even if you don't have Excel installed. You can also copy data from Excel Viewer to another program. However, you cannot edit data, save a workbook, or create a new workbook.

**MS09-068 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac. How does MS09-068 relate to this bulletin (MS09-067)?**

The security update packages in this bulletin, MS09-067, for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB976830), Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB976828), and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (KB976831) also address the vulnerabilities described in MS09-068. Users with Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, or Open XML File Format Converter for Mac installed will only need to install these security update packages once.

**The Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system shipped with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in their version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**Why is this update only Important for all affected versions of Excel?**

Microsoft Office Excel 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Lifecycle Supported Service Packs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) Web site, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

## Excel Cache Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3127

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-3127](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3127).

#### Mitigating Factors for Excel Cache Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3127

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* Users of Office XP and later editions of Office will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document.

#### Workarounds for Excel Cache Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3127

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

  + For Office 2003

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

    "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates must be applied.

  **Impact of workaround.** Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special âexempt directoryâ as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.

  **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

  + For Office 2003

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

    "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates must be applied.
  + For Office 2007

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

    "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000001

    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2007, all of the latest Office 2007 security updates as of May 2007 must be applied.

  **Impact of workaround.** Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special âexempt directoryâ as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  + For Office 2003

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]
    "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000
  + For Office 2007

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

    "BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000
* **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources**

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.

  To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  [Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en)

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:

  </https:>[https:](https://)

  To enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the .xls, .xlt, and .xla file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .xls, .xlt, and .xla file formats:

| Command to enable MOICE to be the registered handler | Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
| --- | --- |
| ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet | ASSOC .xls=Excel.Sheet.8 |
| ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template | ASSOC .xlt=Excel.Template |
| ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin | ASSOC .xla=Excel.Addin |

**Note** On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the commands above will need to be run from an elevated command prompt.

For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

**Impact of workaround.** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

* Do not open Excel files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
