Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-3217:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The iWiccle 1.01 application suffers from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation, leading to both Local File Inclusion (LFI) and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files by manipulating the `module` parameter in the `index.php` URL. This is due to insufficient sanitization of the input, which allows for directory traversal using `../` sequences and null byte injection (`%00`) to bypass file extension checks.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `member_id` parameter when editing users. The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries using `UNION ALL SELECT` to extract sensitive data from the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **LFI:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's file system. This could expose configuration files, source code, database credentials, and other sensitive information, potentially leading to complete server compromise.
*  **SQL Injection:** An attacker can extract data from the database, potentially including user credentials (usernames, passwords, and password hashes), which could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** Both vulnerabilities are exploited through specially crafted HTTP GET requests by manipulating URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific position or credentials are required other than the ability to access the web application's URL.

**Summary**

The provided exploit-db entry details both Local File Inclusion and SQL injection vulnerabilities present in iWiccle 1.01. These vulnerabilities arise from a lack of input sanitization, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files from the server and extract sensitive database information.
