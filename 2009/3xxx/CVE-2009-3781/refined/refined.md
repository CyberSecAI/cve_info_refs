Based on the provided patch, here's the analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The original code in `filefield.module` had a logic error in the `filefield_file_download` function. It was attempting to check node access before actually loading the node. This meant that `$node` variable might not be initialized and could cause issues later in the code flow, but more importantly, the `node_access('view', $node)` check was bypassed in some cases where the node wasn't loaded, and file downloads could be served even without node access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure access control:** The primary weakness is that file downloads were not correctly restricted based on node access permissions. This meant that users could potentially download files attached to nodes that they weren't authorized to view.
*   **Bypassed access check:** The incorrect placement of `node_load()` combined with the boolean check could allow the code to skip the node access check, leading to unauthorized access to files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized file access:** Attackers could potentially download files they should not have access to.
*   **Information disclosure:** Sensitive data stored in files attached to restricted nodes could be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct file download requests:** An attacker would need to know the direct URL of a file attached to a node. The attacker could then attempt to access this file without having view permission on the attached node.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of file URLs:** The attacker would need to know the URL of the file they are trying to download.
*   **No node view permissions:** The attacker would be specifically targeting files attached to nodes they are not allowed to view.

**Patch Details:**

The patch fixes the vulnerability by:

1.  **Loading the node first:**  The `node_load($content['nid'])` is moved before the access check. This ensures that the `$node` variable is always initialized before being used in the `node_access` function.
2.  **Correct boolean check:** The `node_access('view', $node)` check is now compared against `FALSE` to determine if the access should be denied.

This change ensures that file downloads are correctly restricted based on node access permissions.
