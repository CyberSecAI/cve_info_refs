Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the incorrect verification of SSL certificates when a NUL character ('\0') is embedded within the Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName fields of the certificate. This allows an attacker to bypass hostname verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The software (specifically wget in this case) fails to properly handle and validate the NUL character in the certificate's hostname fields.
*   **Lack of Null Termination Handling:** The code likely relies on null-terminated strings, and the presence of a NUL character within a field can lead to premature truncation of the hostname, thus resulting in a bypass of hostname verification.
*   **Incomplete SSL Certificate Verification:** In some cases, particularly in older versions of software using OpenSSL, no name checks were being performed at all.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. By creating a malicious certificate containing a NUL byte in the hostname, they can impersonate a legitimate server and intercept communication.
*   **Data Compromise:**  Successful MitM attacks can result in the disclosure of confidential data being transmitted between the client and the server.
*   **Malware Injection:** An attacker could inject malicious content into the communication stream.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious SSL Certificate:** The attack vector is the use of a specially crafted, malicious SSL certificate issued by a compromised or attacker-controlled Certificate Authority. This malicious certificate contains a null character within the Common Name or Subject Alternative Name fields.
*   **MitM Positioning:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic between the client and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to generate SSL certificates:** The attacker needs the ability to generate a valid SSL certificate, typically through a compromised certificate authority or their own root CA.
*   **MitM network position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic, such as being on the same network or compromising a network device.
*   **Target software vulnerable to this issue:** The attacker targets specific software that does not correctly validate SSL certificates with embedded null characters.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability is described as similar to CVE-2009-2408, which also relates to SSL certificate validation issues.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple software packages, not just `wget`. The content mentions `mutt`, `Qt`, `kdelibs` and `OpenLDAP` as being affected. These applications have since been updated to fix this vulnerability, which indicates a widespread issue.
*   The fix for `wget` involves sanitizing the certificate names and ensuring correct verification.
*  Red Hat has issued a security advisory `RHSA-2009:1549` to address this in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.
*  Fedora also issued updates for Fedora 10, 11, and 12.

The vulnerability is related to improper handling of null bytes during hostname verification of SSL certificates, which can be exploited for man-in-the-middle attacks.
