Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2009-3732:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability in VMware Remote Console (VMrc):** The vulnerability lies within the VMware Remote Console (VMrc), specifically in how it handles format strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The core issue is a format string vulnerability. This occurs when user-controlled input is used as a format string in functions like `printf`, allowing an attacker to manipulate program execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the system where VMrc is installed. The attacker's code runs with the privileges of the user running the VMrc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page or URL:** An attacker needs to trick the VMrc user into opening a malicious web page or following a malicious URL. The vulnerability is triggered through the way VMrc processes data from these sources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to socially engineer the user into visiting a malicious web page or clicking a malicious link.
*   **VMware Remote Console (VMrc) Installation:** The target system must have the vulnerable VMrc browser plugin installed. This plugin is used for accessing console features within VMware's WebAccess.
*   **VMrc from Vulnerable Source:**  The vulnerable VMrc plugin version is obtained from vCenter 4.0 or ESX 4.0 without the ESX400-200911223-UG patch.
*   **Target Platform:** The vulnerability affects Windows-based systems where the VMrc plugin has been installed. Linux-based systems are not affected by this specific vulnerability.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   The content details how to check if a system is vulnerable by examining the file version of the `vmware-vmrc.exe`.
*   The resolution requires uninstalling the affected VMrc, updating the vCenter or ESX server, and reinstalling the VMrc plugin. The Firefox plugin for Windows is noted to become incompatible after patching.
*   The advisory mentions that this vulnerability was reported by Alexey Sintsov from Digital Security Research Group.
