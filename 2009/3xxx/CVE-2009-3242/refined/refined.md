Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities addressed by Wireshark 1.2.2:

**Vulnerabilities Fixed in Wireshark 1.2.2 (as per wnpa-sec-2009-06):**

1.  **GSM A RR Dissector Crash:**
    *   **Root Cause:** A flaw in the GSM A RR dissector could cause a crash.
    *   **Weakness:**  A bug within the dissector's code.
    *  **Impact:** Could lead to a crash of Wireshark.
    *   **Attack vector:** By processing a malformed packet with GSM A RR data.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to capture or craft a malicious GSM A RR packet and have the victim use Wireshark to analyze it.

2.  **OpcUa Dissector Excessive CPU and Memory Usage:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The OpcUa dissector had a bug that could lead to excessive CPU and memory consumption.
    *   **Weakness:** Inefficient processing of OpcUa packets.
    *   **Impact:**  Could lead to denial-of-service by exhausting resources.
    *   **Attack vector:**  By feeding Wireshark a specially crafted OpcUa packet stream.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to capture or craft malicious OpcUa packets and have the victim use Wireshark to analyze it.

3.  **TLS Dissector Crash:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The TLS dissector had a flaw that could cause a crash on some platforms.
    *   **Weakness:**  A bug within the TLS dissector code.
    *   **Impact:** Could lead to a crash of Wireshark.
     *   **Attack vector:** By processing a malformed TLS packet.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities:**  Ability to capture or craft a malicious TLS packet and have the victim use Wireshark to analyze it.

**Additional Information:**

*   The issues were fixed in Wireshark version 1.2.2.
*   The affected versions include 0.99.6 up to and including 1.2.1 for OpcUa and 1.2.0 to 1.2.1 for GSM A RR and TLS dissectors.
*   A workaround was provided to disable the affected dissectors if upgrading is not possible.

**Summary of Impact:**

*   The primary impact of these vulnerabilities is the possibility of causing Wireshark to crash, which could lead to denial of service. In the case of the OpcUa dissector, it could also result in resource exhaustion due to excessive CPU and memory use.
