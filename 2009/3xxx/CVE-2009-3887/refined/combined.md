### @Yeraze **[Yeraze](/Yeraze)** commented [Aug 1, 2014](#issue-39298902)

Where previously they were just excluded for a few bad chars.

Hopefully this addresses [#8](https://github.com/Yeraze/ytnef/issues/8)

Sorry, something went wrong.

**oCERT-2009-013 yTNEF/Evolution TNEF attachment decoder input sanitization errors**

**Description**:

[yTNEF](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ytnef), an open
source filter program that decodes Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format
(TNEF) e-mail attachments, and the [Evolution](http://projects.gnome.org/evolution) TNEF attachment
decoder plugin suffer from directory traversal and buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities lead to arbitrary code execution with the privilege
of the target user running the decoders.

The directory traversal vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization
of the file name used for saving the attachments, as it is computed directly
from properties contained in the TNEF structure without checking for conditions
that allow to traverse outside the temporary directory used for attachment
storage. This leads to arbitrary code execution in case the attacker crafts an
attachment that would overwrite a file used for execution (as an example the
bashrc profile).

Additionally buffer and heap overflow vulnerabilities can be triggered
by passing a file name exceeding a fixed size of 256 bytes in the TNEF data
structure. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited.

The directory traversal vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization   of the file name used for saving the attachments, as it is computed   directly from properties contained in the TNEF structure without checking   for conditions that allow to traverse outside the temporary directory   used for attachment storage. This leads to arbitrary code execution in   case the attacker crafts an attachment that would overwrite a file used   for execution (as an example the bashrc profile).    Additionally buffer and heap overflow vulnerabilities can be triggered by   passing a file name exceeding a fixed size of 256 bytes in the TNEF data   structure.

# yTNEF/Evolution TNEF Attachment decoder plugin directory traversal & buffer overflow vulnerabilities

Yorick Koster, June 2009

### Abstract

yTNEF & the Evolution TNEF Attachment decoder plugin are affected by several directory traversal and buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The directory traversal vulnerabilities allow attackers to overwrite or create local files with the privileges of the target user. Exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerabilities allows for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the target user.

- [CVE-2009-3887](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3887)

### Tested version

These vulnerabilities were discovered using the latest (stable) versions of Evolution (currently 2.62.2) and yTNEF (currently 2.6). The vulnerabilities were verified on the following Linux distributions:

- GNOME version of Mandriva Linux 2009 Spring running Evolution 2.26.1.1 (Evolution plugin installed by default)

- Ubuntu 9.04 running Evolution 2.26.1 (with *evolution-plugins-experimental* package installed)

### Affected functions

The following functions are affected by these issues:

Evolution plugin:

   \* *processTnef()*

   \* *saveVCard()*

   \* *saveVCalendar()*

   \* *saveVTask()*

yTNEF:

   \* *ProcessTNEF()*

   \* *SaveVCard()*

   \* *SaveVCalendar()*

   \* *SaveVTask()*

### Fix

There is currently no fix available.

### Introduction

Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) is a proprietary e-mail attachment format used by Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server. A [plugin](http://www.go-evolution.org/Tnef) for Evolution exists that provides basic support for TNEF encoded e-mails. This plugin uses the [ytnef library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ytnef/) (*libytnef*) for processing TNEF messages. It borrows code from the *ytnef* program, which is a program to work with procmail to decode TNEF streams (winmail.dat attachments). Both applications share (almost) code and are, because of this, both affected by the issues described in this document.

### Evolution TNEF Attachment decoder plugin

The plugin is started on e-mail attachments that have a MIME type of either *application/vnd.ms-tnef* or *application/ms-tnef*. It creates a temporary directory under *~/.evolution/cache/tmp* using the format *tnef-attachment-XXXXXX*. The TNEF attachment is saved as *.evo-attachment.tnef*.

`void

org_gnome_format_tnef(void *ep, EMFormatHookTarget *t)

{

   [...]

   tmpdir = e_mkdtemp("tnef-attachment-XXXXXX");

   if (tmpdir == NULL)

      return;

   filepath = tmpdir;

   name = g_build_filename(tmpdir, ".evo-attachment.tnef", NULL);

   out = camel_stream_fs_new_with_name(name, O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0666);`

The saved file is parsed by *TNEFParseFile()*, the result is stored in a struct of the type *TNEFStruct*. This struct is passed to the function *processTnef()*, which tries to extract all relevant data and attachments from the TNEF stream. Each relevant part of the TNEF stream is stored within the previously created temporary directory that are made available to the end user as separate e-mail attachments.

`/* Extracting the winmail.dat */

   TNEFInitialize(tnef);

   tnef->Debug = verbose;

   if (TNEFParseFile(name, tnef) == -1) {

      printf("ERROR processing file\n");

   }

   processTnef(tnef);

   TNEFFree(tnef);

   /* Extraction done */`

[![](/advisory/AK20090601/001_evolution_tnef_with_two_attachments.png)](/advisory/AK20090601/001_evolution_tnef_with_two_attachments.png)

Figure 1: Evolution showing parsed TNEF stream containing two attachments.

### yTNEF

yTNEF processes TNEF files in a similar manner. It receives a file name from the command line, calls *TNEFParseFile()* that creates a struct *TNEFStruct* after which *ProcessTNEF()* is called. If *ProcessTNEF()* finds attachments it can process, these attachments will be saved locally. The *ProcessTNEF()* function is almost the same as the *processTnef()* function of the Evolution plugin.

`int main(int argc, char ** argv) {

   [...]

   for(i=1; i<argc; i++) {

      [...]

      TNEFInitialize(&TNEF);

      TNEF.Debug = verbose;

      if (TNEFParseFile(argv[ i], &TNEF) == -1) {

         printf("ERROR processing file\n");

         continue;

      }

      ProcessTNEF(TNEF);

      TNEFFree(&TNEF);

   }

}`

### Directory traversal

If a TNEF file is processed, both yTNEF and the Evolution plugin will save certain types of TNEF structures. Special processing functions are available for Contacts, Tasks & Appointments. These functions are called if the *Message Class* is set to a certain value.

`void processTnef(TNEFStruct *tnef) {

   [...]

   /* First see if this requires special processing. */

   /* ie: it's a Contact Card, Task, or Meeting request (vCal/vCard) */

   if (tnef->messageClass[0] != 0) {

      if (strcmp(tnef->messageClass, "IPM.Contact") == 0) {

         saveVCard(tnef);

      }

      if (strcmp(tnef->messageClass, "IPM.Task") == 0) {

         saveVTask(tnef);

      }

      if (strcmp(tnef->messageClass, "IPM.Appointment") == 0) {

         saveVCalendar(tnef);

         foundCal = 1;

      }

   }

   if ((filename = MAPIFindUserProp(&(tnef->MapiProperties),

            PROP_TAG(PT_STRING8,0x24))) != MAPI_UNDEFINED) {

      if (strcmp(filename->data, "IPM.Appointment") == 0) {

         /* If it's "indicated" twice, we don't want to save 2 calendar entries. */

         if (foundCal == 0) {

            saveVCalendar(tnef);

         }

      }

   }`

There is also code that treats TNEF structures with the *Message Class* set to *IPM.Microsoft Mail.Note*. In the Evolution plugin, this code is never called as the global variable *saveRTF* is set to zero. In case of yTNEF this global variable is controlled by the command line.

`if (strcmp(TNEF.messageClass, "IPM.Microsoft Mail.Note") == 0) {

   if ((saveRTF == 1) && (TNEF.subject.size > 0)) {

      // Description

      if ((filename=MAPIFindProperty(&(TNEF.MapiProperties),

            PROP_TAG(PT_BINARY, PR_RTF_COMPRESSED)))

         != MAPI_UNDEFINED) {

[...]`

After the structures mentioned before have been processed, all other attachments are also saved locally. The file names used to save the attachments are obtained from the TNEF data. In case of normal attachments, the code first looks if the TNEF data contains MAPI properties and if so, it will look for specific properties. If these exists, a file name is extracted from these properties. If the properties do not exist, the attachment's title is used. This title is also set through a TNEF structure. If this title is also not available, a default file name will be used instead.

`if ((RealAttachment == 1) || (saveintermediate == 1)) {

/* Ok, it's not an embedded stream, so now we */

/* process it. */

if ((filename = MAPIFindProperty(&(p->MAPI),

      PROP_TAG(30,0x3707)))

   == MAPI_UNDEFINED) {

   if ((filename = MAPIFindProperty(&(p->MAPI),

            PROP_TAG(30,0x3001)))

         == MAPI_UNDEFINED) {

      filename = &(p->Title);

   }

}

if (filename->size == 1) {

   filename = (variableLength*)malloc(sizeof(variableLength));

   filename->size = 20;

   filename->data = (char*)malloc(20);

   sprintf(filename->data, "file_%03i.dat", count);

}

if (filepath == NULL) {

   sprintf(ifilename, "%s", filename->data);

} else {

   sprintf(ifilename, "%s/%s", filepath, filename->data);

}

for(i=0; i<strlen(ifilename); i++)

   if (ifilename[ i] == ' ')

      ifilename[ i] = '_';

   if ((fptr = fopen(ifilename, "wb"))==NULL) {

      printf("ERROR: Error writing file to disk!");

   } else {

      if (object == 1) {

      fwrite(filedata->data + 16,

         sizeof(BYTE),

         filedata->size - 16,

         fptr);

      } else {

      fwrite(filedata->data,

         sizeof(BYTE),

         filedata->size,

         fptr);

      }

      fclose(fptr);

   }

}`

Before a new file is created, all spaces within the file name are replaced with the underscore character. No additional sanitation is performed on the file name. Because of this, it is possible to traverse outside of the temporary directory and create or overwrite any file with the privileges of the target user. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code for example by overwriting *~/.bashrc*.

### Buffer overflow

Beside the directory traversal, it is also possible to trigger a buffer overflow by supplying an overly long file name. This is possible, because the file name is copied in a fixed size buffer (256 bytes). In the Evolution plugin, this triggers a buffer overflow on the heap. In case of yTNEF the file name is copied in a buffer on the stack, thus allowing for a stack-based buffer overflow to occur.

Evolution plugin:

`void processTnef(TNEFStruct *tnef) {

   [...]

   ifilename = (char *) g_malloc(sizeof(char) * 256);

   [...]

      if (filepath == NULL) {

         sprintf(ifilename, "%s", filename->data);

      } else {

         sprintf(ifilename, "%s/%s", filepath, filename->data);

      }`

yTNEF:

`void ProcessTNEF(TNEFStruct TNEF) {

   [...]

   char ifilename[256];

   [...]

      if (filepath == NULL) {

         sprintf(ifilename, "%s", filename->data);

      } else {

         sprintf(ifilename, "%s/%s", filepath, filename->data);

      }`

### Proof of concept

The following Metasploit exploit module can be used to exploit one of the directory traversal vulnerabilities. In addition it can also be used to trigger one of the buffer overflow vulnerabilities that causes Evolution to crash.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-09-07 14:14:53 UTC  ``` Yorick Koster discovered multiple security issues in yTNEF and Evolution's TNEF plugin (based on yTNEF), which are described in oCERT-2009-013 advisory:    <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2009-013.html>    yTNEF, an open source filter program that decodes Transport Neutral   Encapsulation Format (TNEF) e-mail attachments, and the Evolution TNEF   attachment decoder plugin suffer from directory traversal and buffer   overflow vulnerabilities.    The vulnerabilities lead to arbitrary code execution with the privilege   of the target user running the decoders.    The directory traversal vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization   of the file name used for saving the attachments, as it is computed   directly from properties contained in the TNEF structure without checking   for conditions that allow to traverse outside the temporary directory   used for attachment storage. This leads to arbitrary code execution in   case the attacker crafts an attachment that would overwrite a file used   for execution (as an example the bashrc profile).    Additionally buffer and heap overflow vulnerabilities can be triggered by   passing a file name exceeding a fixed size of 256 bytes in the TNEF data   structure. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited.  Further details can be found in Yorick's advisory:   <http://www.akitasecurity.nl/advisory.php?id=AK20090601>  There's no official upstream fix for the issues.  Both yTNEF and Evolution's TNEF plugin are unmaintained according to oCERT's advisory.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2009-09-07 14:19:33 UTC  ``` Evolution's TNEF plugin requires libytnef.  This library is not available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, hence Evolution packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5 are not affected by this problem.  libytnef is available in Fedora, but we do not seem to build TNEF Evolution plugin in any current Fedora version (F10 - F12), so Fedora Evolution packages are unaffected too.  ytnef is currently on it's way to Fedora - see Review Request [bug #485403](show_bug.cgi?id=485403 "CLOSED ERRATA - Review Request: ytnef - Yerase's TNEF Stream Reader.").   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c2)  Vincent Danen    2009-10-27 21:46:35 UTC  ``` There still is no CVE for this issue, so I've requested one: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/10/27/5>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c3)  Vincent Danen    2009-10-28 14:08:43 UTC  ``` This has been given the name [CVE-2009-3721](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3721)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c4)  Vincent Danen    2010-03-09 20:56:50 UTC  ``` [CVE-2009-3721](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3721) is for the buffer overflow, [CVE-2009-3887](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3887) is for the directory traversal.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c5)  Vincent Danen    2010-04-09 20:42:51 UTC  ``` This issue did not affect Fedora previously, but it does now (Fedora 12 and higher):  * Thu Jul 02 2009 Matthew Barnes <mbarnes> - 2.27.3-4.fc12 - Add BR for libpst-devel and libytnef-devel (RH [bug #493049](show_bug.cgi?id=493049 "CLOSED RAWHIDE - Can't import pst-files in Evolution")).  There still does not seem to be an upstream fixes for either libytnef or evolution that I can see.  Debian removed libytnef from their distribution on 20100214 in order to correct this flaw.  No other vendor has provided a fix.  I'm not sure why [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c1) indicates that Fedora Evolution packages are unaffected.  F12 and higher are most definitely affected.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2010-04-12 15:50:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c5)) > I'm not sure why [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c1) indicates that Fedora Evolution packages are > unaffected.  F12 and higher are most definitely affected.  They were not built with ytnef plugin support at that time.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c18)  randall.hand    2014-08-04 17:43:22 UTC  ``` Fixed in newest version : github.com/Yeraze/ytnef   Validated by Yorick.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2014-08-05 09:16:08 UTC  ``` Additional links to expand on information from [comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=521662#c18):   [CVE-2009-3721](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-3721)  Upstream bug: <https://github.com/Yeraze/ytnef/issues/7>  Fixed as part of this pull request: <https://github.com/Yeraze/ytnef/pull/6>  There are unrelated changes as part of the above pull request.
