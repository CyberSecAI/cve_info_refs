Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-3531

**Vulnerable Software:** Universe CMS 1.0.6

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `vnews.php` file, specifically in the handling of the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in the `vnews.php` URL to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored in the database, such as user credentials.
* **Complete System Compromise:** With sufficient privileges, an attacker can potentially gain complete control of the database and, potentially, the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `vnews.php` file, using the `id` parameter to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable Universe CMS application.
* **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests, SQL syntax, and web application vulnerabilities.
* **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit script does not require prior authentication to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract the username and password hash from the `uni_users` table. The injected SQL code is as follows:
```sql
-1+union+select+1,2,3,4,concat(CHAR(60,117,115,101,114,62),login,CHAR(60,117,115,101,114,62),CHAR(60,112,97,115,115,62),password,CHAR(60,112,97,115,115,62)),6+from+uni_users
```
This query injects an SQL statement that selects the `login` and `password` fields from the `uni_users` table, concatenating the results within HTML tags.  The script then parses the response to extract the user and password hash.
