[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)

## Packages

* [firefox-3.5](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.5) -
* [xulrunner-1.9.1](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9.1) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a user

were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0159](/security/CVE-2010-0159))

Orlando Barrera II discovered a flaw in the Web Workers implementation of

Firefox. If a user were tricked into posting to a malicious website, an

attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0160](/security/CVE-2010-0160))

Alin Rad Pop discovered that Firefox's HTML parser would incorrectly free

memory under certain circumstances. If the browser could be made to access

these freed memory objects, an attacker could exploit this to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2009-1571](/security/CVE-2009-1571))

Hidetake Jo discovered that the showModalDialog in Firefox did not always

honor the same-origin policy. An attacker could exploit this to run

untrusted JavaScript from other domains. ([CVE-2009-3988](/security/CVE-2009-3988))

Georgi Guninski discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be

bypassed by utilizing a crafted SVG image. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to read data

from other domains. ([CVE-2010-0162](/security/CVE-2010-0162))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.10

* [xulrunner-1.9.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.1)
  -
  [1.9.1.8+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.1/1.9.1.8%2Bbuild1%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1)
* [firefox-3.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.5)
  -
  [3.5.8+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox-3.5/3.5.8%2Bbuild1%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any

applications that use xulrunner to effect the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [firefox-3.0](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.0) -
* [xulrunner-1.9](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a user

were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could

cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0159](/security/CVE-2010-0159))

Orlando Barrera II discovered a flaw in the Web Workers implementation of

Firefox. If a user were tricked into posting to a malicious website, an

attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0160](/security/CVE-2010-0160))

Alin Rad Pop discovered that Firefox's HTML parser would incorrectly free

memory under certain circumstances. If the browser could be made to access

these freed memory objects, an attacker could exploit this to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2009-1571](/security/CVE-2009-1571))

Hidetake Jo discovered that the showModalDialog in Firefox did not always

honor the same-origin policy. An attacker could exploit this to run

untrusted JavaScript from other domains. ([CVE-2009-3988](/security/CVE-2009-3988))

Georgi Guninski discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be

bypassed by utilizing a crafted SVG image. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to read data

from other domains. ([CVE-2010-0162](/security/CVE-2010-0162))

[testcase sets window.dialogArguments](attachment.cgi?id=389157)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=389157&action=edit)

This issue was reported to security@m.o by Microsoft Vulnerability Research. Credit should go to Hidetake Jo and Microsoft Vulnerability Research.
I can confirm in Firefox 3.5 that the properties of window.dialogArguments are accessible by script across domains. I will attach the testcases shortly. From the email:

General mechanism for Cross-site scripting
It appears that Firefox 3.5 permits cross-domain initialization of window.dialogVariables. This behavior is unlike that of IE and Safari, and would allow exploit of XSS in web pages which assume that the page's dialogVariable can't be initialized in this way.
Technical details of exploit:
1. Find a page on the internet that is reading and using value from window.dialogArguments.
2. On evil.com create a page that calls window.showModalDialog (<http://victim.com/page.xx> <<http://victim.com/page.xx>> , ...);
2a. This allows you to initialize the window.dialogArguments on the victim domain.
3. Lure victim to the exploit page on evil.com
Finder(s):
Hidetake Jo and Microsoft Vulnerability Research.
Type of Issue:
Cross-domain initialization of window.dialogArguments enabling XSS exploits
Product(s) and version(s) that contain the bug:
Firefox 3.5
The finders have not tested against other versions of Firefox or against platforms other than Windows Vista Sp1
Special configuration requirements:
No special hardware or configuration is needed. The PoC has been demonstrated on a system with Windows Vista Sp1 + latest security updates (as of July 2009)

This makes our behavior match IE's where we don't pass any arguments if the URI of the dialog is not same origin with the caller. This copies some ugly URI related code from the window watcher which I'd like to avoid, but I haven't found a cleaner way yet...

Hrm. Is there a reason for doing it that way? Wouldn't it make more sense to store the principal the arguments come from as part of SetNewArguments and then do a check any time we're actually binding the arguments on the inner window, against the principal of said inner window? That would make sure that the arguments are set on an inner if and only if we're same-origin with it anyway (and hence could have just set it ourselves). Is there an obvious problem with that, other than needing a signature change on SetNewArguments to take the principal?

Can we not examine the principal of the modal window after ShowAsModal returns and clear the returnValue if it's not same-origin with the opener principal?
Seems like that would be the smart thing to do anyway, in case the modal window gets navigated to another origin which then sets returnValue.
That said, if the modal origin is different, will caller even be able to get returnValue?

Ah, right. I sort of forgot that we actually have a window by that point.

Said getting happens in C++ (in ShowModalDialog) and is the return value from that function, so yes.

[Updated fix.](attachment.cgi?id=394965&action=diff)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=504862&attachment=394965)

This does what bz suggested, it stores the principal where the arguments came from, and checks when the dialog is dismissed whether the caller can access the last loaded document in the dialog before getting the return value out of it. Making those changes got a bit nasty. I had to pass the principals along with the arguments, which meant changing the interface nsIScriptGlobalObject which is what had the SetNewArguments() method, which IMO doesn't belong in that interface at all. So since I was changing that interface anyways, I decided to move that method to nsPIDOMWindow, and rename it to SetArguments(), as there's nothing new about the arguments AFAICT. Getting things to work right in the nsGlobalWindow where we create new inner windows and migrate arguments from one to another was fun too.
But this patch does work, fixes the security bug and some other bad bugs in this code as well, and I think this is the way we'd want to go here for now.

Attached patch

[Additional change required for this to pass mochitest](attachment.cgi?id=404118&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=404118&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=504862&attachment=404118)

This is needed in addition to the previous patch for this to pass our tests. The reason for this is that there's a difference in the order of events when we're opening a modal dialog whose URL is a javascript: URI vs not. In the javascript: URI case we end up executing the JS in the URI before we've called SetNewDocument() on the global window, so a call to GetDialogArguments() can happen before the arguments are moved from the outer window to the inner window, whereas in the regular case where the content of a loaded URI asks for the dialog arguments we've already moved them to the inner.
This stuff really needs cleaning up at some point. Ideally we wouldn't attempt to share members with the dialog argument code we use for XUL dialogs, which I suspect would simplify this code a fair bit, or we should make some saner decisions regarding the time of availability of these arguments, etc. But for now, I'd just like to land this to get this blocker out of the way...

So with that last patch, if called on an outer we won't forward to the inner, right? That seems wrong somehow. Wouldn't we want to only skip forwarding if we have no inner?
I wonder whether it would make sense to have javascript: URIs trigger inner window creation before executing script. I'm a little surprised they don't already! But that can be a separate bug.

After talking this over with bz (and sorting out some confusion regarding whether we need any additional changes at all), I think this is the way to go here. This makes it so that when opening a modal dialog and calling SetArguments() on it we make sure that we at that point set the arguments on the inner window if it has already been created. This passes mochitest.

Talked this over with Johnny. We need to backout this fix across all branches and respin both releases without it. (This \*should\* be causing a leak on 1.9.0, per him, but isn't for some reason.)
Johnny, please back this out on... 1.9.1, 1.9.0, GECKO1916\_20091130\_RELBRANCH (hg), and GECKO190\_20091130\_RELBRANCH (cvs).

Yeah, but I don't think I can do that before I understand this leak, as there is no evidence on 1.9.2 of a leak like the one we see in 1.9.1 with this patch.

The leaks are due to [bug 508774](/show_bug.cgi?id=508774 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsGlobalModalWindow traverses mArguments twice"), which was fixed on trunk before 1.9.2 branched, but after 1.9.1.

Al, I have problems to reproduce this issue with Firefox 3.5.7. Given the revoked flags we have backed-out the fix for 3.5.7 and the failure should be visible. Can you please verify it with 3.5.8pre?

The first testcase repros cleanly in 1.9.1.7 but the second one ("testcase reads window.dialogArguments from other domain") returns "undefined" for both values. This is the fixed behavior. The first testcase does the same in 1.9.1.8 (and no longer displays the dialog about injection).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-04

## XSS due to window.dialogArguments being readable cross-domain

Announced
February 17, 2010
Reporter
Hidetake Jo, TippingPoint ZDI
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.18
* Firefox 3.5.8
* Firefox 3.6
* SeaMonkey 2.0.3

### Description

Security researcher **Hidetake Jo** of Microsoft
Vulnerability Research reported that the properties set on an object
passed to `showModalDialog` were readable by the document
contained in the dialog, even when the document was from a different
domain. This is a violation of the same-origin policy and could
result in a website running untrusted JavaScript if it assumed
the `dialogArguments` could not be initialized by another
site.

An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative, also independently reported this issue to Mozilla.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Mozilla Firefox was upgraded to version 3.5.8, fixing various bugs and security issues.
On openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1 Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 3.0.18.
On openSUSE 11.2 Mozilla Seamonkey was updated to version 2.0.2.
Following security issues have been fixed:
MFSA 2010-01 / CVE-2010-0159: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser
engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes
showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume
that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.
MFSA 2010-02 / CVE-2010-0160: Security researcher Orlando Barrera II reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that Mozilla's implementation of Web
Workers contained an error in its handling of array data types when processing
posted messages. This error could be used by an attacker to corrupt heap memory
and crash the browser, potentially running arbitrary code on a victim's
computer.
MFSA 2010-03 / CVE-2009-1571: Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia
Research reported that the HTML parser incorrectly freed used memory when
insufficient space was available to process remaining input. Under such
circumstances, memory occupied by in-use objects was freed and could later be
filled with attacker-controlled text. These conditions could result in the
execution or arbitrary code if methods on the freed objects were subsequently
called.
MFSA 2010-04 / CVE-2009-3988: Security researcher Hidetake Jo of Microsoft
Vulnerability Research reported that the properties set on an object passed to
showModalDialog were readable by the document contained in the dialog, even
when the document was from a different domain. This is a violation of the
same-origin policy and could result in a website running untrusted JavaScript
if it assumed the dialogArguments could not be initialized by another site.
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative, also
independently reported this issue to Mozilla.
MFSA 2010-05 / CVE-2010-0162: Mozilla security researcher Georgi Guninski
reported that when a SVG document which is served with Content-Type:
application/octet-stream is embedded into another document via an <embed> tag
with type="image/svg+xml", the Content-Type is ignored and the SVG document is
processed normally. A website which allows arbitrary binary data to be uploaded
but which relies on Content-Type: application/octet-stream to prevent script
execution could have such protection bypassed. An attacker could upload a SVG
document containing JavaScript as a binary file to a website, embed the SVG
document into a malicious page on another site, and gain access to the script
environment from the SVG-serving site, bypassing the same-origin policy.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart the Mozilla browser after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
