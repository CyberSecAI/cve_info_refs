# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)

* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-53

## Local downloaded file tampering

Announced
October 27, 2009
Reporter
Jeremy Brown
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.15
* Firefox 3.5.4

### Description

Security researcher **Jeremy Brown** reported that the
file naming scheme used for downloading a file which already exists in
the downloads folder is predictable. If an attacker had local access
to a victim's computer and knew the name of a file the victim intended
to open through the Download Manager, he could use this vulnerability
to place a malicious file in the world-writable directory used to save
temporary downloaded files and cause the browser to choose the
incorrect file when opening it. Since this attack requires local
access to the victim's machine, the severity of this vulnerability was
determined to be low.

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

On 09/03/09, Jeremy Brown reported a security vulnerability in the download manager / file handling code to security@mozilla.org.
Mozilla Firefox 3.x Download Manager Local Exploit
Jeremy Brown 07-24-2009
TESTED
Ubuntu Linux 9.04 (Jaunty) + Mozilla Firefox 3.0.12 -> Fully Exploitable
Windows XP Professional SP3 + Mozilla Firefox 3.5.1 -> Partially Exploitable
When downloading files through Firefox and choosing the "Open with" option, Firefox will create a temporary file
in the form of RANDOM.part ("RANDOM" is random alphanumeric characters and ".part" is the extension). When the
download completes, Firefox saves the completed file in the "/tmp" directory as its original filename and opens
it with the program's handler (for example, Ark for compressed archives, VLC for .mp3, WINE for .exe, etc).
Now, what if there is already a file with an identical filename in the temporary file directory? Firefox uses
the scheme of saving and opening the completed download as "/tmp/file-#.zip", where "file" is the file's name,
"-#" is a dash and the next available number in order, and ".zip" is of course the file's extension. So if
"/tmp/file.zip" already exists and the user tries to download a file with the same name, Firefox saves and opens
the newly downloaded file as "/tmp/file-1.zip". That scheme looked suspicious to me, and raised a couple good
questions.
1) What is the maximum number in the filename?
2) What happens when it reaches that maximum number?
Testing has proved that 9999, for example "/tmp/file-9999.zip", is the maximum number Firefox will use to deal
with identical "Open with" filenames. Instead of using "/tmp/file-10000.zip", Firefox will just use the original
identical file instead of the one it was supposed to download and open. That can get dangerous when local users
can write to "/tmp" just like everybody else :)
To exploit this situation, we need to know the filename that will be downloaded ahead of time. Then it is just
a matter of creating the excess files, placing our "replacement" file (with the identical filename) in "/tmp",
and waiting for the target user to use the "Open with" option to download and open a file of our choosing. We
wouldn't even nessesarily have to know "ahead of time". According to how long it would take to complete the
download (remember Firefox is writing to "/tmp/RANDOM.part" until its finished downloading), we could do our
business while the file is still downloading (again, as long as we know its filename).
There are many scenarios where we could leverage this vulnerability... here is one example.
\* Administrator is downloading openssh-5.2.tar.gz
\* We run the exploit to replace openssh-5.2.tar.gz with a modified version
\* Administrator installs our OpenSSH 5.2 with our \_modifications\_
For a bonus, the download history will still show the name of the site that supplied the original file, even
when the target user opened the attacker's file instead.
There are only two real conditions that have to be met for exploitation to succeed:
1. We need the ability to locally write in "/tmp" (shell, ftp, etc with write permissions for "/tmp")
2. The target user downloads and opens the filename using "Open with"
Firefox on Windows has slightly different results. I found during testing that when the download completes, the
right file will be opened. But, although unreliable, we were able to get the history of the file in download
manager to show the replacement file and it will be opened if the user chooses to open it from there.

Example exploitation:
linux@ubuntu:~$ ./ffdlx 2000 zip /home/linux/Desktop/test.zip
(target downloads 2000.zip from a website but opens test.zip instead)
exploit complete!

There's no really happy solution in [bug 369462](/show_bug.cgi?id=369462 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"Content-Disposition: attachment\" + text/html allows the downloaded file to read some parts of the user's filesystem"). This bug is easier to fix: increase the sequential-numbering limit to infinite or make downloads fail once there are too many sequentially named files.

Hmm. So testing this on Mac, here's what I see:
1) The file is NOT automatically opened in the helper application (as expected).
2) Double-clicking the file in download manager opens the wrong file (the one
that was placed by the attacker).
Is the behavior different on Linux or Windows? I don't see why it should be; nsExternalAppHandler::ExecuteDesiredAction bails out if the CreateUnique fails and doesn't run the helper app...

This is a different bug (don't have number handy) that has been around since forever. It's not trivial to solve, but it is solvable if we need to fix it for this.

I think the downloaded file still has a "ghost pointer" in the download manager list even though the temp file didn't get copied (because 10000 files named that way were already there).
CreateUnique returns NS\_ERROR\_FILE\_TOO\_BIG if a unique name can't be created... then in nsDownloadManager.cpp:
2723 // Make sure the suggested name is unique since in this case we don't
2724 // have a file name that was guaranteed to be unique by going through
2725 // the File Save dialog
2726 rv = target->CreateUnique(nsIFile::NORMAL\_FILE\_TYPE, 0600);
2727 NS\_ENSURE\_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
the error encounteres NS\_ENSURE\_SUCCESS, which causes the OpenWithApplication() method to abort, so the file isn't auto-launched (as bz said in [comment #7](/show_bug.cgi?id=514823#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - Incremental filename choosing scheme for duplicate filenames vulnerable (especially with the use of /tmp)")), but it appears that the file is still listed in the download manager.
Ultimately, the problem is that the download manager doesn't clean up after or properly handle this failure to copy from temp to target -- and instead just punts and points to whatever file already existed. This won't trigger an auto-run of the malicious file, but a user will probably double-click the file if it doesn't open automatically, so it's an inconsistency in what was downloaded versus what is pointed to by the list item.
Perhaps we should prompt for a new file name with a standard save-as dialog when we can't automatically rename the file. "file named X already exists, please choose a new name."
They could use the save-as dialog to force overwrite of the malicious copy, or they could pick a new name. Prompting will also alert the user something fishy is going on when they see the 10000 files in the directory (unless they remember downloading the file 10000 times).

Jeremy, I'm still on the "trying to understand what the bug is" part of things. Do you see something different from what I describe in [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=514823#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - Incremental filename choosing scheme for duplicate filenames vulnerable (especially with the use of /tmp)")? [Comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=514823#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Incremental filename choosing scheme for duplicate filenames vulnerable (especially with the use of /tmp)") makes it sound like you do...
I'll try to test this on Windows and Linux tomorrow.

"2) Double-clicking the file in download manager opens the wrong file (the one
that was placed by the attacker)." <-- vulnerability
Firefox should not open the replacement file at any time, not even when double clicked in the download history after the original file is downloaded, which also shows information making the user think that everything went as planned.
As per previous comments, if the renaming scheme is reached at max, then Firefox should either
A) Prompt to rename to another file and save as that filename
B) Throw an error thats there are too many temp files
C) Rename to an infinite scheme (gotta be careful, not recommended)
D) A combination of A, B, and/or C
Those are my thoughts...

Yes, yes. I agree with that, in case that wasn't clear. Is there another issue, or is that the only problem?
The reason I ask is because there are at least 3 different CreateUnique calls involved, in at least 2 different areas of the code. Depending on what we're trying to fix, the fix would involve different sets of them....

As far as I know, the renaming scheme for temporary files created using "Open With" is the vulnerability I have found. If there are any others that anyone else knows of, please comment here. Otherwise, a fix for this issue should be the main priority.

In case I wasn't clear, [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=514823#c13 "VERIFIED FIXED - Incremental filename choosing scheme for duplicate filenames vulnerable (especially with the use of /tmp)") only refers to temporary files created for use with helper applications. There are multiple different codepaths that do that, triggered by different actions. Some do correct error checking apparently (see [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=514823#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - Incremental filename choosing scheme for duplicate filenames vulnerable (especially with the use of /tmp)") item 1), right? Is there one that doesn't other than the "double-click in the download manager" codepath that we need to worry about?
Which is why I'd still like a straight answer to my question from [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=514823#c13 "VERIFIED FIXED - Incremental filename choosing scheme for duplicate filenames vulnerable (especially with the use of /tmp)")....

OK. I just tested on Linux, and the behavior I see is exactly the same as in [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=514823#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - Incremental filename choosing scheme for duplicate filenames vulnerable (especially with the use of /tmp)"). Therefore either [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=514823#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Incremental filename choosing scheme for duplicate filenames vulnerable (especially with the use of /tmp)") is incorrect when it talks about the two conditions for exploitability (need a third one, that being to double-click in the download manager when the file doesn't actually open) or there's something I'm missing in the steps to reproduce. I'm testing with FC9 and using a PDF file.

And the download manager double-click issue doesn't rely on overflowing the createUnique counter, as [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=514823#c8 "VERIFIED FIXED - Incremental filename choosing scheme for duplicate filenames vulnerable (especially with the use of /tmp)") says. If I have a /tmp/foo.pdf containing PDF A and I open a foo.pdf containing PDF B in the browser it gets saved as /tmp/foo-1.pdf and opened correctly. Now if I double-click in the download manager, I get PDF A opening (so /tmp/foo.pdf, not /tmp/foo-1.pdf).
I'm happy to go ahead and cancel the download on createUnique failure in ExecuteDesiredAction, just so we don't get into the social-engineering situation of the download manager showing the file and such; I'll attach a patch for this in a few mins. But it sounds like we need to solve the download manager problem no matter what, right? And again, is there another way to trigger the bug other than explicit double-click in the download manager? I haven't found one yet....

Hmm, this reminds me of [bug 478394](/show_bug.cgi?id=478394 "VERIFIED DUPLICATE - targetFile.path is not updated when the target file already exists") for some reason...

Good news and bad news. Canceling on failure to createUnique gives a totally useless "unknown error occurred" dialog and marks the download as failed in the download manager. So far so good. Double-clicking the failed entry in the download manager seems to redownload the file and save it to the original name (foo.pdf in my case). Double-clicking again opens that file. So this allows us to clobber existing files (undesirable), but does make sure that we only open the file we meant to download, sort of. I'm not sure what a better behavior would be for the download manager here.

It, and many other bugs are all a duplicate of [bug 301328](/show_bug.cgi?id=301328 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Download Manager opens the wrong file"). It's been a very long standing issue in the download manager.

@ [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=514823#c17 "VERIFIED FIXED - Incremental filename choosing scheme for duplicate filenames vulnerable (especially with the use of /tmp)"): Although I cannot confirm now, when I first was testing this bug I'm pretty confident that the file opened automatically, that is why I wrote the 2 conditions. But like I said, I cannot confirm that now. It does look like the user needs to double click in the download manager for this attack to complete.
1. The ability to write in the temporary file directory, "/tmp" by default on Linux (shell, ftp, etc with write permissions could be helpful for making this work remotely)
2. The target user chooses to download the file and chooses the "Open with" preference
3. The target user also has to double click the file in the download manager (in some testing the file automatically opened, but that can no longer be confirmed)
Sufficient?

You will want to call nsDownload::FailDownload. That will use the generic message if you pass an empty or NULL message.

Possibly, but I've got a number of blockers that got assigned to me while I was away last week. I think I've pretty much said what needs to be done for a patch in this bug, but someone should write a test which will probably be the most time-intensive part of this fix.

So, what exactly do we want/need fixed in the scope of this bug? I'll work on this, but I want to make sure I fully understand what we want/need fixed, and I don't find that terribly clear in the bug yet.Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

When a user uses the "Open With" option when download files with download manager, the file is stored in /tmp/file.zip. If the file is downloaded and saved more than one time, the scheme is file-1.zip, file-2.zip, etc. Once the scheme reaches file-10000.zip, the file is not saved and download manager shows file.zip as the last file downloaded. We do not want that to happen, because an attacker can exploit this scheme to get the target to open the attacker's file.zip, instead of the file the target downloaded.

Right - I got that much. My question is more about what/how we actually want to fix [this]. Do we just want to propagate the failure to create a unique file? Writing a test for this bug is not going to be fun :/

Shawn, what we need here is to make the download manager actually use the final filename the data ended up at. Right now it doesn't. That bites not only in cases when we fail to create the unique file; even if we succeed at it, the download manager opens the old existing file, as far as I can tell.

Right, but that's [bug 301328](/show_bug.cgi?id=301328 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Download Manager opens the wrong file") and as I recall (I talked to either you or biesi about it probably two years ago) it's non trivial to fix. Is there a stopgap we can do that's safe to take on all branches until the user experience gets better (like [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=514823#c22 "VERIFIED FIXED - Incremental filename choosing scheme for duplicate filenames vulnerable (especially with the use of /tmp)"))?

Is [bug 301328](/show_bug.cgi?id=301328 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Download Manager opens the wrong file") a security hole?

We could delete the file from the download manager on failure to create the file, I suppose. It's suboptimal UI, but would be a stopgap.
I believe [bug 301328](/show_bug.cgi?id=301328 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Download Manager opens the wrong file") is a security hole, yes, as much as this one is. If the attacker places its file in /tmp first and you open yours and then ever try to open it again via the download manager, you lose.

Well, there are lots of issues with the download manager UI such as if the file is replaced with a malicious one. We'll just see that the file exists, and try to open it.

So, does this make sense to have an automated test for the file creation behavior? The only way I can see doing this is keep calling CreateUnique until it fails for a file, then try to download that same file name. This seems like a potentially bad test strategy.
I can pretty easily write a test to make sure that the download manager fails appropriately though.

> such as if the file is replaced with a malicious one
I'd think a different user typically can't do that with a file in /tmp that you own. Is that not the case?

The user's permissions of the file would determine that. But there is no need for it to be taken into consideration for this attack; an attacker places their own files in /tmp before the target ever begins the download.

Looks to me like we already have coverage in the download manager that if we get a failure state, it gets marked as such in the UI (and shows a prompt) in <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/mozapps/downloads/tests/chrome/test_bug_412360.xul>

Just making sure, is this the right message to alert to the user?
"The download cannot be saved because an unknown error occurred. Please try again."
Failing to CreateUnique is probably going to fail if retried?

We can get a different string, but I'd like to do that in a follow-up so we can have one patch that applies to all branches if that's OK with you.

Note, we'd display this error for anything that ExecuteDesiredAction would fail on.

Sure. We can even make use of the nsresult aStatus given to FailDownload to figure out what message to show ;)

That depends on when this lands on the 1.9.0 and 1.9.1 branches. If [comment #57](/show_bug.cgi?id=514823#c57 "VERIFIED FIXED - Incremental filename choosing scheme for duplicate filenames vulnerable (especially with the use of /tmp)") can happen quickly and the patch is approved, it can probably make the upcoming Firefox 3.0.15/3.5.4 release train in late October. Otherwise, it'll be the next release after that. You can see our upcoming releases, code freeze dates, etc. at <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases>.
