{
  "Root cause": "The file naming scheme used by Firefox when downloading a file to the same location where a file of the same name already exists is predictable. When the sequence of file names reaches a certain limit, Firefox will use the original existing file instead of the newly downloaded file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Predictable file naming scheme.",
    "Insufficient error handling when creating unique file names.",
    "Download manager opens the original existing file when the newly downloaded file fails to save."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with local access to the victim's machine can replace a file the victim is about to download with a malicious file. When the victim tries to open the downloaded file, they will open the malicious file instead.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Attacker places a malicious file in the /tmp directory before the victim downloads a file of the same name.",
    "The victim downloads a file using the 'Open with' option."
    "The victim double-clicks the file in the download manager."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker requires local access to the victim's machine and the ability to write to the /tmp directory."
