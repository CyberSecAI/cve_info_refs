```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the `sPath` parameter in `prodler.class.php`. This allows an attacker to inject a URL, leading to Remote File Inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to `prodler.class.php`, injecting a malicious URL in the `sPath` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and control a remote server to host the malicious file."
