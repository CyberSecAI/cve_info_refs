Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-3611:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `backintime` application, when removing old backups (snapshots), changes the permissions of all files within the snapshot to mode `0777` (world-readable and writable) before deleting them. This is done recursively using `chmod -R a+rwx`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Permissions Handling:** The application uses `chmod -R a+rwx`, making all files and directories in the backup world-readable and writable.
*   **Shared File Permissions:** Files shared between different backups have their permissions changed by this process and this permission change will persist across backups.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The world-readable permissions allow any local user to read sensitive information contained in the backups.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The world-writable permissions allow any local user to modify or delete files in the backup.
*   **Time of Exposure:** The files are vulnerable for a period of time before deletion, and this period can be significant as the actual deletion may not occur immediately after the permission change.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data within backups.
*   **Data Integrity Compromise:** Modification or deletion of backup data, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** Although not directly a privilege escalation, the ability to modify backup files could be used as a step in a larger attack aimed at escalating privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** A local attacker (any user on the system) can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where `backintime` is used.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges. The vulnerability is exploited by the `backintime` application changing file permissions and leaving them world-accessible.
*   The attacker needs to be able to observe that a backup is being deleted to take advantage of the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The issue is present in `common/snapshots.py` in `backintime` versions before the fix.
*   The Debian bug report ([http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=543785](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=543785)) and related patch ([http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/b/backintime/backintime_0.9.26-3.diff.gz](http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/b/backintime/backintime_0.9.26-3.diff.gz)) provide specific details of the vulnerability and the fix which changes the permissions modification to only directories by using a find command and changing the permission change to `u+wx` rather than `a+rwx`.
*   The vulnerability is also tracked in Red Hat Bugzilla ([https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=520210](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=520210)), Gentoo Bugzilla ([http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=289047](http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=289047)), and Launchpad ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/backintime/+bug/434256](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/backintime/%2Bbug/434256)).
*   The vulnerability impacts Fedora 10, Fedora 11, and rawhide.
* The fix involves removing the `chmod -R a+rwx` command and using a find command to only change the directory permission to `u+wx`
