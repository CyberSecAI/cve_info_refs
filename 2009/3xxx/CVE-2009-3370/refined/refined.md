Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Firefox browser's form auto-fill feature (Satchel) not properly distinguishing between user-generated events and events synthesized by a web page.  Specifically, a malicious webpage could trigger the autocomplete dropdown and use synthesized key events (like cursor down) to select items, and then use left or right arrow keys to fill the selected value into the textbox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Untrusted Event Handling:** The primary weakness was that the autocomplete mechanism reacted to events that were not directly generated by the user. This allowed malicious websites to manipulate the auto-fill functionality programmatically.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The autocomplete feature stored sensitive information like form history, search queries, usernames, email addresses, and even credit card numbers. This information was accessible if the user had previously entered it into a form, and if the website did not disable autocomplete.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Theft:** A malicious website could extract sensitive information stored in the browser's auto-fill history by triggering the autocomplete popup, navigating it with synthesized keyboard events, and capturing the selected value.
*   **Privacy Violation:** User's private data like search history, usernames, email addresses, and credit card details could be exposed to third-party websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** A specially crafted web page could exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Synthesized Events:** The attacker leverages Javascript to generate fake mouse focus and key press events to manipulate the auto-fill function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a web page:** The attacker needs to host a malicious web page.
*   **User interaction:** The attack requires some level of user interaction. The user needs to visit the malicious page and, in some cases, may be tricked into holding down or repeatedly pressing arrow keys. The attacker may be able to automate this with focus management but the core filling of the field requires a user generated event according to the bug report.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The bug report ([Bug 511615](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=511615)) provides a detailed discussion of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, test cases, and the patches.
*   The vulnerability affected different form fields, like the Firefox search bar (`searchbar-history`), Google search fields (`q`), and other website form fields that didn't disable autocomplete.
*   The fix involved adding a check to event listeners to ignore untrusted events, ensuring only user-generated events trigger or affect autocomplete.
*  The fix was implemented in Firefox versions 3.0.15, 3.5.4 and later versions.
