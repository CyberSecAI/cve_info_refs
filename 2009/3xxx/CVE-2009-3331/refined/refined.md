Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the presence of multiple Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities in DDL CMS 1.0. This means the application is not properly sanitizing user-supplied input, specifically the `wwwRoot` parameter, allowing an attacker to include remote files in the application's execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files. This occurs because the application uses a user-controlled parameter (`wwwRoot`) in a file inclusion mechanism without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file (e.g., a PHP shell) the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system, allowing the attacker to steal data, install malware, or use the system as a launching point for other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through manipulated HTTP GET requests to specific PHP files within the DDL CMS application.
*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts URLs containing the vulnerable parameters (e.g., `wwwRoot`) with a link to a remote file under the attacker's control, typically containing malicious code.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable DDL CMS application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable PHP files and the `wwwRoot` parameter to inject the malicious URL.

**Vulnerable Files:**

The following files are vulnerable to RFI via the `wwwRoot` parameter:

*   `header.php`
*   `submit.php`
*   `submitted.php`
*   `autosubmitter/index.php`

**Exploit Example:**

The exploit involves sending a GET request to the vulnerable files with the `wwwRoot` parameter set to a URL pointing to a remote file (e.g., a shell script):
```
/header.php?wwwRoot=[Shell.txt?]
/submit.php?wwwRoot=[Shell.txt?]
/submitted.php?wwwRoot=[Shell.txt?]
/autosubmitter/index.php?wwwRoot=[Shell.txt?]
```

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, providing exact vulnerable paths and a basic exploit.
*   The exploit-db entry identifies the application version and provides a download link to the vulnerable code.

In summary, DDL CMS 1.0 suffers from multiple RFI vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to gain complete control over the affected system.
