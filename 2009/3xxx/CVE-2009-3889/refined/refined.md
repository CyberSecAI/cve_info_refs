{
  "CVE-2009-3889": {
    "Description": "The dbg_lvl file for the megaraid_sas driver in the Linux kernel has world-writable permissions, which allows local users to change the (1) behavior and (2) logging level of the driver by modifying this file.",
    "Root cause": "The dbg_lvl file within the sysfs interface for the megaraid_sas driver had incorrect permissions, making it world-writable.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect file permissions",
      "Inadequate access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can change the behavior and logging level of the megaraid_sas driver. This could lead to a denial of service or other unspecified impacts.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system where the vulnerable driver is loaded.",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs local user access to the system."
  }
