1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update fixes various security issues and some bugs in the SUSE
Linux Enterprise 9 kernel.
CVE-2009-4005: The collect\_rx\_frame function in
drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc\_usb.c in the Linux kernel allows attackers
to have an unspecified impact via a crafted HDLC packet that arrives
over ISDN and triggers a buffer under-read.
CVE-2009-3080: Array index error in the gdth\_read\_event function in
drivers/scsi/gdth.c in the Linux kernel allows local users to cause
a denial of service or possibly gain privileges via a negative event
index in an IOCTL request.
CVE-2010-0007: Missing CAP\_NET\_ADMIN checks in the ebtables netfilter
code might have allowed local attackers to modify bridge firewall
settings.
CVE-2009-4536: drivers/net/e1000/e1000\_main.c in the e1000 driver
in the Linux kernel handles Ethernet frames that exceed the MTU by
processing certain trailing payload data as if it were a complete
frame, which allows remote attackers to bypass packet filters via a
large packet with a crafted payload.
CVE-2009-3889: The dbg\_lvl file for the megaraid\_sas driver in the
Linux kernel has world-writable permissions, which allows local users
to change the (1) behavior and (2) logging level of the driver by
modifying this file.
CVE-2009-1883: The z90crypt\_unlocked\_ioctl function in the z90crypt
driver in the Linux kernel does not perform a capability check for
the Z90QUIESCE operation, which allows local users to leverage euid
0 privileges to force a driver outage.
CVE-2009-2903: Memory leak in the appletalk subsystem in the Linux
kernel, when the appletalk and ipddp modules are loaded but the
ipddp"N" device is not found, allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (memory consumption) via IP-DDP datagrams.
CVE-2009-3621: net/unix/af\_unix.c in the Linux kernel allows local
users to cause a denial of service (system hang) by creating an
abstract-namespace AF\_UNIX listening socket, performing a shutdown
operation on this socket, and then performing a series of connect
operations to this socket.
CVE-2009-3620: The ATI Rage 128 (aka r128) driver in the Linux
kernel does not properly verify Concurrent Command Engine (CCE)
state initialization, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly gain
privileges via unspecified ioctl calls.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update fixes various bugs and some security issues in the SUSE
Linux Enterprise 10 SP 3 kernel.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2009-3939: A sysctl variable of the megaraid\_sas driver was
world writable, allowing local users to cause a denial of service or
potential code execution.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.6 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3889: The dbg\_lvl file for the megaraid\_sas driver in the
Linux kernel before 2.6.27 has world-writable permissions, which
allows local users to change the (1) behavior and (2) logging level
of the driver by modifying this file.
This was already fine in SLES 10 SP3 GA due to a driver update of the
megaraid\_sas driver and is just listed for completeness here.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.6 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
CVE-2009-4005: The collect\_rx\_frame function in
drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc\_usb.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32-rc7
allows attackers to have an unspecified impact via a crafted HDLC
packet that arrives over ISDN and triggers a buffer under-read.
This requires the attacker to be able to send ISDN low level frames
to the host.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.2 (HIGH) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3080: A negative offset in a ioctl in the GDTH RAID driver
was fixed.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.2 (HIGH) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-4021: The fuse\_direct\_io function in fs/fuse/file.c in the
fuse subsystem in the Linux kernel might allow attackers to cause a
denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and OOPS) via vectors
possibly related to a memory-consumption attack.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-2903: Memory leak in the AppleTalk subsystem in the Linux
kernel when the AppleTalk and ipddp modules are loaded but the ipddp"N"
device is not found, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory consumption) via IP-DDP datagrams.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.1 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3621: net/unix/af\_unix.c in the Linux kernel allows local
users to cause a denial of service (system hang) by creating an
abstract-namespace AF\_UNIX listening socket, performing a shutdown
operation on this socket, and then performing a series of connect
operations to this socket.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3612 / CVE-2005-4881: The tcf\_fill\_node function in
net/sched/cls\_api.c in the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.x
before 2.6.32-rc5, and 2.4.37.6 and earlier, does not initialize a
certain tcm\_\_pad2 structure member, which might allow local users
to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via unspecified
vectors. NOTE: this issue existed because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2005-4881.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N)
CVE-2009-3620: The ATI Rage 128 (aka r128) driver in the Linux
kernel does not properly verify Concurrent Command Engine (CCE)
state initialization, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly gain
privileges via unspecified ioctl calls.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3726: The nfs4\_proc\_lock function in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c
in the NFSv4 client in the Linux kernel allows remote NFS servers
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic)
by sending a certain response containing incorrect file attributes,
which trigger attempted use of an open file that lacks NFSv4 state.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.8 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
The rio and sx serial multi port card drivers were disabled via a
modprobe blacklist due to severe bugs.
For a full list of changes, please read the RPM changelog.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing this update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=526068#c0)  Bryn M. Reeves    2009-09-28 16:23:45 UTC  ``` Description of problem: The megaraid_sas driver exposes a number of driver attributes in sysfs. Many of these are read-only, just export information from the driver and are world-readable.  A couple of attributes are writable and may be used to change the behaviour of the driver (e.g. setting debug logging levels, selecting poll vs. interrupt I/O mode etc).  Some of these writable attributes are mistakenly created with world-writable permissions, e.g. dbg_lvl and poll_mode_io:  rw-rw-rw- root root  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/dbg_lvl rw-rw-rw- root root  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/poll_mode_io  $ grep 'DRIVER_ATTR.*S_IWUGO' drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas.c  static DRIVER_ATTR(dbg_lvl, S_IRUGO|S_IWUGO, megasas_sysfs_show_dbg_lvl, static DRIVER_ATTR(poll_mode_io, S_IRUGO|S_IWUGO,  This would allow an unprivileged user to affect kernel driver behaviour and logging level.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 2.6.18-*.el5  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: (On a system with megaraid_sas loaded) 1. ls -l /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/dbg_lvl 2. ls -l /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/poll_mode_io     Actual results: rw-rw-rw- root root  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/dbg_lvl rw-rw-rw- root root  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/poll_mode_io  Expected results: rw------- root root  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/dbg_lvl rw------- root root  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/poll_mode_io  Additional info:  Upstream made the dbd_lvl permissions more restrictive:  commit 66dca9b8c50b5e59d3bea8b21cee5c6dae6c9c46 Author: Joe Malicki <jmalicki> Date:   Thu Aug 14 17:14:48 2008 -0400      [SCSI] megaraid_sas: remove sysfs dbg_lvl world writeable permissions          /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/dbg_lvl defaults to being     world-writable, which seems bad (letting any user affect kernel driver     behavior and logging level).          This turns off group and user write permissions, so that on typical     production systems only root can write to it.

## Details

It was discovered that the AX.25 network subsystem did not correctly

check integer signedness in certain setsockopt calls. A local attacker

could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

Ubuntu 9.10 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-2909](/security/CVE-2009-2909))

Jan Beulich discovered that the kernel could leak register contents to

32-bit processes that were switched to 64-bit mode. A local attacker

could run a specially crafted binary to read register values from an

earlier process, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-2910](/security/CVE-2009-2910))

Dave Jones discovered that the gdth SCSI driver did not correctly validate

array indexes in certain ioctl calls. A local attacker could exploit

this to crash the system or gain elevated privileges. ([CVE-2009-3080](/security/CVE-2009-3080))

Eric Dumazet and Jiri Pirko discovered that the TC and CLS subsystems

would leak kernel memory via uninitialized structure members. A local

attacker could exploit this to read several bytes of kernel memory,

leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3228](/security/CVE-2009-3228), [CVE-2009-3612](/security/CVE-2009-3612))

Earl Chew discovered race conditions in pipe handling. A local attacker

could exploit anonymous pipes via /proc/\*/fd/ and crash the system or

gain root privileges. ([CVE-2009-3547](/security/CVE-2009-3547))

Dave Jones and Francois Romieu discovered that the r8169 network driver

could be made to leak kernel memory. A remote attacker could send a large

number of jumbo frames until the system memory was exhausted, leading

to a denial of service. Ubuntu 9.10 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3613](/security/CVE-2009-3613)).

Ben Hutchings discovered that the ATI Rage 128 video driver did not

correctly validate initialization states. A local attacker could

make specially crafted ioctl calls to crash the system or gain root

privileges. ([CVE-2009-3620](/security/CVE-2009-3620))

Tomoki Sekiyama discovered that Unix sockets did not correctly verify

namespaces. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a system hang,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-3621](/security/CVE-2009-3621))

J. Bruce Fields discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly use the credential

cache. A local attacker using a mount with AUTH\_NULL authentication

could exploit this to crash the system or gain root privileges. Only

Ubuntu 9.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3623](/security/CVE-2009-3623))

Alexander Zangerl discovered that the kernel keyring did not correctly

reference count. A local attacker could issue a series of specially

crafted keyring calls to crash the system or gain root privileges.

Only Ubuntu 9.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3624](/security/CVE-2009-3624))

David Wagner discovered that KVM did not correctly bounds-check CPUID

entries. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system

or possibly gain elevated privileges. Ubuntu 6.06 and 9.10 were not

affected. ([CVE-2009-3638](/security/CVE-2009-3638))

Avi Kivity discovered that KVM did not correctly check privileges when

accessing debug registers. A local attacker could exploit this to

crash a host system from within a guest system, leading to a denial of

service. Ubuntu 6.06 and 9.10 were not affected. ([CVE-2009-3722](/security/CVE-2009-3722))

Philip Reisner discovered that the connector layer for uvesafb, pohmelfs,

dst, and dm did not correctly check capabilties. A local attacker could

exploit this to crash the system or gain elevated privileges. Ubuntu

6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3725](/security/CVE-2009-3725))

Trond Myklebust discovered that NFSv4 clients did not robustly

verify attributes. A malicious remote NFSv4 server could exploit

this to crash a client or gain root privileges. Ubuntu 9.10 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-3726](/security/CVE-2009-3726))

Robin Getz discovered that NOMMU systems did not correctly validate

NULL pointers in do\_mmap\_pgoff calls. A local attacker could attempt to

allocate large amounts of memory to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 6.06 and 9.10 were affected. ([CVE-2009-3888](/security/CVE-2009-3888))

Joseph Malicki discovered that the MegaRAID SAS driver had

world-writable option files. A local attacker could exploit these

to disrupt the behavior of the controller, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2009-3889](/security/CVE-2009-3889), [CVE-2009-3939](/security/CVE-2009-3939))

Roel Kluin discovered that the Hisax ISDN driver did not correctly

check the size of packets. A remote attacker could send specially

crafted packets to cause a system crash, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2009-4005](/security/CVE-2009-4005))

Lennert Buytenhek discovered that certain 802.11 states were not handled

correctly. A physically-proximate remote attacker could send specially

crafted wireless traffic that would crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 9.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-4026](/security/CVE-2009-4026), [CVE-2009-4027](/security/CVE-2009-4027))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change (except for Ubuntu 6.06)

the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires

you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you

might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to

update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel

version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system

upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

kernel security and bug fix update (RHSA-2010-0046)

Original Release Date: February 3, 2010

Last Revised: November 4, 2010

Number: ASA-2010-026

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

\* an array index error was found in the gdth driver. A local user could
send a specially-crafted IOCTL request that would cause a denial of service
or, possibly, privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3080](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3080.html) to this issue.

\* a flaw was found in the FUSE implementation. When a system is low on
memory, fuse\_put\_request() could dereference an invalid pointer, possibly
leading to a local denial of service or privilege escalation.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4021](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4021.html) to this issue.

\* a deficiency was discovered in the fasync\_helper()
implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to leverage a
use-after-free of locked, asynchronous file descriptors to cause a denial
of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4141](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4141.html) to this issue.

\* it was reported that the [RHSA-2009:1243](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1243.html)
update introduced two flaws in the routing implementation. If an attacker
was able to cause a large enough number of collisions in the routing hash
table (via specially-crafted packets) for the emergency route flush to
trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if the kernel routing cache was
disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be left behind after a route
lookup, leading to a kernel panic. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4272](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4272.html) to this issue.

\* the [RHSA-2009:0225](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0225.html) update introduced a rewrite attack flaw in the
do\_coredump() function. A local attacker able to guess the file name a
process is going to dump its core to, prior to the process crashing, could
use this flaw to append data to the dumped core file. This issue only
affects systems that have "/proc/sys/fs/suid\_dumpable" set to 2 (the
default value is 0). The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2006-6304](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2006-6304.html) to this issue.

The fix for [CVE-2006-6304](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2006-6304.html) changes the expected behavior: With suid\_dumpable
set to 2, the core file will not be recorded if the file already exists.
For example, core files will not be overwritten on subsequent crashes of
processes whose core files map to the same name.

\* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,
32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-2910](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-2910.html) to this issue.

\* the [RHBA-2008:0314](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2008-0314.html) update introduced N\_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV)
support in the qla2xxx driver, resulting in two new sysfs pseudo files,
"/sys/class/scsi\_host/[a qla2xxx host]/vport\_create" and "vport\_delete".
These two files were world-writable by default, allowing a local user to
change SCSI host attributes. This flaw only affects systems using the
qla2xxx driver and NPIV capable hardware. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3556](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3556.html) to this issue.

\* permission issues were found in the megaraid\_sas driver. The "dbg\_lvl"
and "poll\_mode\_io" files on the sysfs file system ("/sys/") had
world-writable permissions. This could allow local, unprivileged users to
change the behavior of the driver. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2009-3889](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3889.html) and [CVE-2009-3939](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3939.html) to these issues.

\* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the firewire-ohci driver
used for OHCI compliant IEEE 1394 controllers. A local, unprivileged user
with access to /dev/fw\* files could issue certain IOCTL calls, causing a
denial of service or privilege escalation. The FireWire modules are
blacklisted by default, and if enabled, only root has access to the files
noted above by default. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4138](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4138.html) to this issue.

\* a buffer overflow flaw was found in the hfs\_bnode\_read() function in the
HFS file system implementation. This could lead to a denial of service if a
user browsed a specially-crafted HFS file system, for example, by running
"ls". The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-4020](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-4020.html) to this issue.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2010%3A0046)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* an array index error was found in the gdth driver. A local user could

send a specially-crafted IOCTL request that would cause a denial of service
or, possibly, privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3080, Important)

* a flaw was found in the FUSE implementation. When a system is low on

memory, fuse\_put\_request() could dereference an invalid pointer, possibly
leading to a local denial of service or privilege escalation.
(CVE-2009-4021, Important)

* Tavis Ormandy discovered a deficiency in the fasync\_helper()

implementation. This could allow a local, unprivileged user to leverage a
use-after-free of locked, asynchronous file descriptors to cause a denial
of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-4141, Important)

* the Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team reported the RHSA-2009:1243

update introduced two flaws in the routing implementation. If an attacker
was able to cause a large enough number of collisions in the routing hash
table (via specially-crafted packets) for the emergency route flush to
trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if the kernel routing cache was
disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be left behind after a route
lookup, leading to a kernel panic. (CVE-2009-4272, Important)

* the RHSA-2009:0225 update introduced a rewrite attack flaw in the

do\_coredump() function. A local attacker able to guess the file name a
process is going to dump its core to, prior to the process crashing, could
use this flaw to append data to the dumped core file. This issue only
affects systems that have "/proc/sys/fs/suid\_dumpable" set to 2 (the
default value is 0). (CVE-2006-6304, Moderate)

The fix for CVE-2006-6304 changes the expected behavior: With suid\_dumpable
set to 2, the core file will not be recorded if the file already exists.
For example, core files will not be overwritten on subsequent crashes of
processes whose core files map to the same name.

* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,

32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. (CVE-2009-2910, Moderate)

* the RHBA-2008:0314 update introduced N\_Port ID Virtualization (NPIV)

support in the qla2xxx driver, resulting in two new sysfs pseudo files,
"/sys/class/scsi\_host/[a qla2xxx host]/vport\_create" and "vport\_delete".
These two files were world-writable by default, allowing a local user to
change SCSI host attributes. This flaw only affects systems using the
qla2xxx driver and NPIV capable hardware. (CVE-2009-3556, Moderate)

* permission issues were found in the megaraid\_sas driver. The "dbg\_lvl"

and "poll\_mode\_io" files on the sysfs file system ("/sys/") had
world-writable permissions. This could allow local, unprivileged users to
change the behavior of the driver. (CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, Moderate)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the firewire-ohci driver

used for OHCI compliant IEEE 1394 controllers. A local, unprivileged user
with access to /dev/fw\* files could issue certain IOCTL calls, causing a
denial of service or privilege escalation. The FireWire modules are
blacklisted by default, and if enabled, only root has access to the files
noted above by default. (CVE-2009-4138, Moderate)

* a buffer overflow flaw was found in the hfs\_bnode\_read() function in the

HFS file system implementation. This could lead to a denial of service if a
user browsed a specially-crafted HFS file system, for example, by running
"ls". (CVE-2009-4020, Low)

Bug fix documentation for this update will be available shortly from
www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/errata/RHSA-2010-0046/Kernel\_Security\_Update/
index.html

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=526788#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-10-01 19:10:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 363386](attachment.cgi?id=363386&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=363386&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch  An information leak was discovered in the kernel where a 32-bit process running in 64-bit mode could possibly read certain 64 bit registers. Quoting the upstream commit: <http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/10/1/164>      x86: Don't leak 64-bit kernel register values to 32-bit processes      While 32-bit processes can't directly access R8...R15, they can     gain access to these registers by temporarily switching themselves     into 64-bit mode.      Therefore, registers not preserved anyway by called C functions     (i.e. R8...R11) must be cleared prior to returning to user mode.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=526788#c4)  Chuck Ebbert    2009-10-06 12:02:21 UTC  ``` Official upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux%2Fkernel%2Fgit%2Ftorvalds%2Flinux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=24e35800cdc4350fc34e2bed37b>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=526788#c8)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-15 00:21:25 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.27.37-170.2.104.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/kernel-2.6.27.37-170.2.104.fc10>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=526788#c9)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-15 22:37:12 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.27.37-170.2.104.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

Message-ID: <4AFCFF1C.6090604@kernel.sg>
Date: Fri, 13 Nov 2009 14:39:24 +0800

Subject: CVE request: kernel: bad permissions on megaraid_sas sysfs files

The megaraid_sas driver exposes a number of driver attributes in sysfs.
Many of these are read-only, just export information from the driver and
are world-readable.

A couple of attributes are writable and may be used to change the
behaviour of the driver (e.g. setting debug logging levels, selecting
poll vs. interrupt I/O mode etc).

Some of these writable attributes are mistakenly created with
world-writable permissions, e.g. dbg_lvl and poll_mode_io.

This would allow an unprivileged user to affect kernel driver behaviour
and logging level.

Upstream made the dbd_lvl permissions more restrictive:
<http://git.kernel.org/linus/66dca9b8c50b5e59d3bea8b21cee5c6dae6c9c46>

The poll_mode_io pseudofile still has world-writable permissions
upstream. I'm getting my colleague to submit a patch.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=526068>

Thanks, Eugene

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update fixes a several security issues and various bugs in the
SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP 2 kernel.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2009-3939: A sysctl variable of the megaraid\_sas driver was
world writable, allowing local users to cause a denial of service
or potential code execution.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.6 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-4005: The collect\_rx\_frame function in
drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc\_usb.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32-rc7
allows attackers to have an unspecified impact via a crafted HDLC
packet that arrives over ISDN and triggers a buffer under-read.
This requires the attacker to be ISDN link-local.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.2 (HIGH) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3080: A negative offset in a ioctl in the GDTH RAID driver
was fixed.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.2 (HIGH) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-4021: The fuse\_direct\_io function in fs/fuse/file.c in the
fuse subsystem in the Linux kernel might allow attackers to cause a
denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and OOPS) via vectors
possibly related to a memory-consumption attack.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3889: The dbg\_lvl file for the megaraid\_sas driver in the
Linux kernel before 2.6.27 has world-writable permissions, which
allows local users to change the (1) behavior and (2) logging level
of the driver by modifying this file.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.6 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
CVE-2009-2903: Memory leak in the AppleTalk subsystem in the Linux
kernel when the AppleTalk and ipddp modules are loaded but the ipddp"N"
device is not found, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory consumption) via IP-DDP datagrams.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.1 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3621: net/unix/af\_unix.c in the Linux kernel allows local
users to cause a denial of service (system hang) by creating an
abstract-namespace AF\_UNIX listening socket, performing a shutdown
operation on this socket, and then performing a series of connect
operations to this socket.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3612 / CVE-2005-4881: The tcf\_fill\_node function in
net/sched/cls\_api.c in the netlink subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.x
before 2.6.32-rc5, and 2.4.37.6 and earlier, does not initialize a
certain tcm\_\_pad2 structure member, which might allow local users
to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via unspecified
vectors. NOTE: this issue existed because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2005-4881.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N)
CVE-2009-3620: The ATI Rage 128 (aka r128) driver in the Linux
kernel does not properly verify Concurrent Command Engine (CCE)
state initialization, which allows local users to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly gain
privileges via unspecified ioctl calls.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.9 (MEDIUM) (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3726: The nfs4\_proc\_lock function in fs/nfs/nfs4proc.c
in the NFSv4 client in the Linux kernel allows remote NFS servers
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic)
by sending a certain response containing incorrect file attributes,
which trigger attempted use of an open file that lacks NFSv4 state.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.8 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
CVE-2009-3613: The swiotlb functionality in the r8169 driver in
drivers/net/r8169.c in the Linux kernel allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (IOMMU space exhaustion and system crash)
by using jumbo frames for a large amount of network traffic, as
demonstrated by a flood ping.
CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.8 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
The rio and sx serial multi port card drivers were disabled via a
modprobe blacklist due to severe bugs.
For a full list of changes, please read the RPM changelog.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

# RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes security issues and several
bugs is now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
(RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the IPv6 Extension Header (EH) handling
implementation in the Linux kernel. The skb->dst data structure was not
properly validated in the ipv6\_hop\_jumbo() function. This could possibly
lead to a remote denial of service. (CVE-2007-4567)

The Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team reported two flaws in the routing
implementation. If an attacker was able to cause a large enough number of
collisions in the routing hash table (via specially-crafted packets) for
the emergency route flush to trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if
the kernel routing cache was disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be
left behind after a route lookup, leading to a kernel panic.
(CVE-2009-4272)

A flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in
the Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using packets larger
than the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in
partial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws
could also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.
(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538)

A flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel.
Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network cards
supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of
service. (CVE-2009-4537)

The x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current
Privilege Level (CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL). A user in a guest
could leverage these flaws to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or
possibly escalate their privileges within that guest. (CVE-2010-0298,
CVE-2010-0306)

A flaw was found in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation. Access
to the internal data structure pit\_state, which represents the data state
of the emulated PIT, was not properly validated in the pit\_ioport\_read()
function. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2010-0309)

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2006-6304, CVE-2009-2910,
CVE-2009-3080, CVE-2009-3556, CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, CVE-2009-4020,
CVE-2009-4021, CVE-2009-4138, and CVE-2009-4141; ntp issue CVE-2009-3563;
dbus issue CVE-2009-1189; dnsmasq issues CVE-2009-2957 and CVE-2009-2958;
gnutls issue CVE-2009-2730; krb5 issue CVE-2009-4212; bind issue
CVE-2010-0097; gzip issue CVE-2010-0001; openssl issues CVE-2009-2409 and
CVE-2009-4355; and gcc issue CVE-2009-3736.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* on systems with a large number of disk devices, USB storage devices may

get enumerated after "/dev/sdz", for example, "/dev/sdcd". This was not
handled by the udev rules, resulting in a missing "/dev/live" symbolic
link, causing installations from USB media to fail. With this update, udev
rules correctly handle USB storage devices on systems with a large number
of disk devices, which resolves this issue. (BZ#555083)

As RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from the KVM update
RHSA-2010:0088 have been included in this update:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0088.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=526068#c0)  Bryn M. Reeves    2009-09-28 16:23:45 UTC  ``` Description of problem: The megaraid_sas driver exposes a number of driver attributes in sysfs. Many of these are read-only, just export information from the driver and are world-readable.  A couple of attributes are writable and may be used to change the behaviour of the driver (e.g. setting debug logging levels, selecting poll vs. interrupt I/O mode etc).  Some of these writable attributes are mistakenly created with world-writable permissions, e.g. dbg_lvl and poll_mode_io:  rw-rw-rw- root root  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/dbg_lvl rw-rw-rw- root root  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/poll_mode_io  $ grep 'DRIVER_ATTR.*S_IWUGO' drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas.c  static DRIVER_ATTR(dbg_lvl, S_IRUGO|S_IWUGO, megasas_sysfs_show_dbg_lvl, static DRIVER_ATTR(poll_mode_io, S_IRUGO|S_IWUGO,  This would allow an unprivileged user to affect kernel driver behaviour and logging level.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 2.6.18-*.el5  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: (On a system with megaraid_sas loaded) 1. ls -l /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/dbg_lvl 2. ls -l /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/poll_mode_io     Actual results: rw-rw-rw- root root  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/dbg_lvl rw-rw-rw- root root  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/poll_mode_io  Expected results: rw------- root root  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/dbg_lvl rw------- root root  /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/poll_mode_io  Additional info:  Upstream made the dbd_lvl permissions more restrictive:  commit 66dca9b8c50b5e59d3bea8b21cee5c6dae6c9c46 Author: Joe Malicki <jmalicki> Date:   Thu Aug 14 17:14:48 2008 -0400      [SCSI] megaraid_sas: remove sysfs dbg_lvl world writeable permissions          /sys/bus/pci/drivers/megaraid_sas/dbg_lvl defaults to being     world-writable, which seems bad (letting any user affect kernel driver     behavior and logging level).          This turns off group and user write permissions, so that on typical     production systems only root can write to it.
