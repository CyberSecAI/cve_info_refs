{
  "CVE-2009-3555": {
    "root_cause": "The TLS/SSL protocol does not properly handle session renegotiation requests, allowing an attacker to inject data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attack",
      "Insecure session renegotiation",
       "Missing cryptographic binding between original and renegotiated TLS/SSL sessions."
    ],
    "impact": "A man-in-the-middle attacker can inject arbitrary data into an encrypted session, potentially impersonating a legitimate client or injecting malicious requests.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "Man-in-the-middle position on the network between the client and server."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the network traffic between the client and the server."
