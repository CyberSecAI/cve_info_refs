Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-3633:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization within the `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue` API function of TYPO3. This function is used to prepare values for insertion into JavaScript code, but the sanitization algorithm was inadequate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an unauthenticated XSS flaw. Because the `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue` function does not properly sanitize input, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   Defacing websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue` API function is used in both backend modules and frontend extensions. Therefore the vulnerability can be exploited without needing a valid backend login
*   Attackers could leverage the vulnerability by injecting malicious code where the vulnerable function processes user supplied input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker does not need a valid backend login. The vulnerability can be exploited on both frontend and backend.

**Affected Versions:**

*   TYPO3 versions 4.0.13 and below, 4.1.12 and below, 4.2.9 and below, 4.3.0beta1 and below.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered medium to high severity due to the potential impact and ability to be triggered without authentication.
*   The fix involves updating to TYPO3 versions 4.1.13, 4.2.10, or 4.3beta2 which contain the necessary patches to properly sanitize the input.
* The advisory mentions that the `t3lib_div::quoteJSvalue` is used in backend and frontend extensions, making the issue more critical.
