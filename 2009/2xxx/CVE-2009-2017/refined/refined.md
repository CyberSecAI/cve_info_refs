Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2017:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw in the `products.php` script of the Virtue Book Store application.
*   The vulnerability is triggered via the `cid` parameter passed in the GET request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `cid` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as admin usernames and passwords. In the provided exploit, the attacker retrieves the `id`, `login`, and `password` from the `admin` table.
*   **Complete database takeover:** While not demonstrated in the provided exploit, SQL injection vulnerabilities can potentially lead to complete database takeover depending on the database user permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `cid` parameter of a GET request to the vulnerable `products.php` page.
*   **Publicly Accessible:** The vulnerability is present in a publicly accessible web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges or network access is needed beyond normal HTTP connectivity.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit code provided demonstrates how to extract admin credentials using a `UNION SELECT` statement to combine the results of multiple queries and `concat` to return the results in one row.
* The provided exploit is written in PHP and is executed via CLI.
*   The provided exploit targets the `admin` table specifically, retrieving the `id`, `login`, and `password` columns.
*  The vendor is identified as "Virtue Book Store" from the exploit details, and the vulnerable URL is `http://www.virtuenetz.com/book/products.php?cid=[SQLI]`
