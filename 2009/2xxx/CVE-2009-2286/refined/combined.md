Hi,
version 1:1.5.2-5 that I released to unstable is suitable for stable
aswell. Prior to this bugfix unstable and stable both contained
version 1:1.5.2-4. Attached is a patch with the fix. Do you want me to
build it for stable aswell?

Thank you for getting in touch with us. Judging from the context in which this
bug manifests itself, I think releasing a DSA for it is overkill. It happens
when creating a new X-Face header, which is something you would do rarely,
mostly not with any random image you didn't check out before, always as an
unprivileged user and what can happen is a crash of the conversion which is
harly harmful. The security implications of this are very minor. Normally
there's a process to fix minor security issues through a stable point update
but I think this one is even too minor for that. It's great that testing and
unstable are fixed for the future, but I propose that we just leave it at
that and consider this case closed.

Thank you for getting sid/squeeze fixed quickly.

cheers,
Thijs

i would agree.  the implications (a user-initiated application crash on
invalid input) are so minor that this probably should not have been
tagged as a security concern nor given a CVE in the first place.
although, has the possibility of code injection been fully ruled out?

I don't know, but I would agree that the risk is small enough to drop
the matter and close the case.

It seems that the vulnerability was introduced by a Debian patch [1],
that somehow found its way into Fedora, as well. I cannot find the
relevant code in the Gentoo sources, nor does the PoC file cause any
abnormal behaviour in our "vanilla" compface.

Steven, maybe you want to update the CVE description to limit the scope
of the issue?

Thanks,
Alex

It seems that Fedora compface packages contain this patch since the
first import to Fedora:

<http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/compface/devel/compface-1.5.2-stack-smashing.patch>
