Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2009-1836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way browsers handle non-200 HTTP responses to a proxy CONNECT request when establishing an HTTPS connection through a proxy. Specifically, if a proxy returns a non-200 response (other than 407 for authentication), the browser might process the response body as if it came from the intended HTTPS server, rather than recognizing it as an error from the proxy itself. This can be exploited if an attacker controls the proxy or intercepts the communication with the proxy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Handling of Proxy Responses:** The browser doesn't properly validate the HTTP status code returned by the proxy in response to a CONNECT request for HTTPS. It treats non-200 responses (other than 407) as valid responses, leading to the processing of the response body.
*   **Lack of Origin Validation:** The browser fails to verify the origin of the content received from the proxy. This allows an attacker-controlled proxy to inject malicious content into the context of the targeted HTTPS website.
*   **Cookie Exposure:** As a result of the above weaknesses, the malicious content can execute Javascript, which can access cookies and other sensitive information associated with the targeted HTTPS site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the context of a legitimate HTTPS website.
*   **Data Theft:** The injected script can steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive data, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
*   **Phishing:** An attacker can create fake HTTPS content to trick the user into revealing sensitive information, like login credentials.
*   **Arbitrary Actions:** Attackers can use the compromised context to perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker intercepts the browser's CONNECT request to a proxy server.
*   **Compromised Proxy:** An attacker controls a proxy server used by the victim.
*   **Malicious Proxy:** The victim is tricked into using a malicious proxy controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept or control the communication between the browser and the proxy server (or control the proxy itself)
*   **Proxy Response Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the HTTP response that the malicious proxy sends back to the browser.

**Technical Details (from Bugzilla):**

*   The fix involves checking for a flag `SSLConnectFailed()` within the `nsHttpChannel::ProcessResponse()` function.
*   If `SSLConnectFailed()` is true (indicating a non-200 response from the proxy during HTTPS setup), the connection is treated as a network error.
*   A specific error code, `NS_ERROR_PROXY_CONNECTION_REFUSED`, is used to indicate a proxy related issue (rather than an issue with the target website).
*   The fix handles 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) responses separately to allow for proxy authentication.
*   The fix avoids rendering the response body from proxy servers when the connection fails.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content from `research.microsoft.com` includes a paper titled "Pretty-Bad-Proxy: An Overlooked Adversary in Browsersâ€™ HTTPS Deployments" which describes this type of attack in detail.
*   The bug report from Mozilla indicates that this issue was also identified and fixed in Chrome/Chromium.
*   The Bugzilla discussion reveals a consideration of displaying proxy error pages but this was determined to be insecure due to potential phishing attacks.
*   Later discussion suggests a need for a more robust fix that provides a secure way to display proxy messages to users in a non-exploitable manner.
*   The fix was backported to older versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey.

In summary, the vulnerability described is a man-in-the-middle attack exploiting the way browsers process HTTP proxy responses for HTTPS connections. It is an XSS issue because an attacker can inject javascript into the browser, which is very dangerous as it would be running in the context of the user's session with an https website, allowing the attacker to perform any actions the user could do themselves. The fix involves preventing the processing of response bodies from proxy servers when the SSL connection setup fails. The content is relevant to CVE-2009-1836.
