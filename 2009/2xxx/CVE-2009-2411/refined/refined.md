  "cve": "CVE-2009-2411",
  "description": "Matt Lewis discovered that Subversion performs insufficient input validation of svndiff streams. Malicious servers could cause heap overflows in clients, and malicious clients with commit access could cause heap overflows in servers, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution in both cases.",
  "affected_software": {
    "name": "Subversion",
     "versions": [
        "1.4.x",
        "1.5.x",
        "1.6.x"
     ]
  },
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation of svndiff streams",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow",
       "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution or denial of service",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious Subversion servers",
      "Malicious Subversion clients"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Malicious server: requires ability to serve crafted svndiff streams.",
      "Malicious client: Requires commit access to a vulnerable server."
    ],
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability affects both Subversion clients and servers. A malicious server can trigger a heap overflow on vulnerable clients during checkout or update operations. Conversely, a malicious client with commit access can cause a heap overflow on a vulnerable server."
