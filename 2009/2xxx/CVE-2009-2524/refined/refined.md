  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2009-2524": {
      "summary": "The Microsoft Windows Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is vulnerable to a denial of service. This is due to improper handling of malformed packets during NTLM authentication. An attacker could send specially crafted anonymous NTLM authentication requests, causing the LSASS service to stop responding and restart the computer.",
      "root_cause": "Integer underflow due to improper handling of malformed NTLM packets during authentication.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of malformed network packets",
        "Integer overflow/underflow"
       ],
      "impact": "Denial of service. Successful exploitation can cause the affected system to automatically reboot.",
      "attack_vector": "Network. An attacker can send a maliciously crafted packet during the NTLM authentication process.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can send the crafted NTLM packets.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending malformed packets during the NTLM authentication process which results in an integer underflow within LSASS. The issue affects Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 systems. It also affects Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems that have the KB968389 update (Extended Protection for Authentication) installed. Systems without KB968389 are not vulnerable. The fix ensures that LSASS handles specific values used in the authentication process correctly."
