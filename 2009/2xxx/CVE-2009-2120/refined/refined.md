Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to SQL injection flaws in TekBase All-in-One 3.1. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in the application. The provided exploits demonstrate the ability to inject SQL code through the `zahl` parameter in `admin.php` and the `y` parameter in `members.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, table names).
    - Potentially modify or delete data within the database.
    - Gain unauthorized access to the application's administrative functionality.
    - The examples demonstrate the ability to extract database table names and admin credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests by manipulating specific parameters (`zahl` and `y`) in the URLs of vulnerable pages (`admin.php` and `members.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - For the `admin.php` vulnerability, administrative access to the application is required.
   - For the `members.php` vulnerability, the attacker needs to be a member of the application.
   - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit examples use `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve data from the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` and potentially other tables.
- The exploit suggests that there are more vulnerabilities, but only two are demonstrated.
- The application is noted as closed-source.
