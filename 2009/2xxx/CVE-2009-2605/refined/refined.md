    {
      "root_cause": "The application uses unsanitized cookie data in an SQL query, leading to SQL injection.",

        "SQL Injection",
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Authentication Bypass"

      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP cookie manipulation"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to set HTTP cookies.",
       "details": "The vulnerability is located in `adminquery.php`. The script retrieves the admin username and password from the `trupuser` and `truppassword` cookies without proper sanitization. The values are then directly used in an SQL query. By setting the cookies with SQL injection payloads, such as `admin' or '1'='1`, an attacker can bypass the authentication check, thus granting them access to administrative functionalities. The exploit requires `magic_quotes_gpc` to be OFF."
