Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-2968:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Incomplete sanitization of user input in a support component of the VMware Studio web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to upload a file to an arbitrary directory within the VMware Studio virtual appliance. This is a classic directory traversal issue, where the software doesn't properly validate user-supplied paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker could upload malicious files to any location on the virtual appliance.
*   **Potential for further compromise:** This arbitrary file upload can be used to execute code, achieve remote command execution, or otherwise compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is present in the web interface of VMware Studio.
*   **User Input:** It is exploited by manipulating user input during file upload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need network access to the VMware Studio web interface.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable component:** The attacker would need to know which web component is vulnerable to exploit it.
*   **Ability to craft malicious upload requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send HTTP requests to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects the VMware Studio 2.0 public beta and is addressed in the GA release (build 1017-185256).
*   Virtual machines created using the vulnerable version are not directly affected.
