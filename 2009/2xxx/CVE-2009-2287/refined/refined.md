{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel fails to validate the cr3 register value provided by userspace via the KVM_SET_SREGS ioctl.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of user-supplied input.",
      "Trusting user-mode applications to provide valid kernel data."
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with the ability to manipulate /dev/kvm can cause a denial of service by providing an invalid cr3 value, which leads to a NULL pointer dereference within the kernel.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation through manipulation of /dev/kvm.",
      "Specifically, providing a bogus cr3 register value via the KVM_SET_SREGS ioctl."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access with the ability to manipulate /dev/kvm, commonly used for virtualization.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because KVM only validates the cr3 register value when set by the guest OS, not when set by the host's userspace via ioctl. This allows userspace to provide invalid values, triggering a NULL pointer dereference in `gfn_to_rmap()` when KVM attempts to activate the non-existent page table root."
