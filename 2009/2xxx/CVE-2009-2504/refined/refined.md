  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2009-2504",
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in GDI+ that can allow a malicious Microsoft .NET application to gain unmanaged code execution privileges. Microsoft .NET applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability.",
    "affected_components": [
      "GDI+",
      ".NET Framework"
    ],
    "root_cause": "This vulnerability is a result of an integer overflow in certain GDI+ APIs that are accessible from .NET Framework applications.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute code either in the context of the currently logged on user, or in the context of the service account associated with an application pool identity. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker could place a malicious Microsoft .NET Framework application on a network share and lure users on that network to execute this application; host a specially crafted Web site that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML Browser Application) and then convince a user to view the Web site; or, if a web hosting environment allows users to upload custom ASP.NET applications, an attacker user could upload a malicious ASP.NET application that uses this vulnerability.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious .NET application and convince users to execute the file. The attacker could also host a malicious website and convince users to access it.",
    "additional_details": "This vulnerability is related to how GDI+ manages buffers when certain .NET API calls are made.",
   "mitigations": [
    "It is very unlikely that an attacker could realistically influence a non-malicious .NET application to make the API calls to the vulnerable functions in the right way to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment this is sent in an e-mail message."
      ],
     "workarounds":[
         "Restrict access to gdiplus.dll.",
         "Disable XAML Browser Applications in Internet Explorer.",
         "Disable partially trusted .NET applications.",
         "Prevent RSClientPrint from running in Internet Explorer."
