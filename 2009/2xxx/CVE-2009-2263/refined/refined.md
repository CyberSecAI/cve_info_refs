{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'page' parameter of index.php.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by exploiting the LFI vulnerability.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'page' parameter in the URL of the index.php script to include directory traversal sequences and a file path, the attacker can force the application to read and display local files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific prior authentication is mentioned in the exploit details."
