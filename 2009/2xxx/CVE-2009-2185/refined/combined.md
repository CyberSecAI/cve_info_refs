| |  | | | --- | --- | | UpgradesRelease notice for Ingate Firewall® 4.8.1 and Ingate SIParator® 4.8.1  | Release name: | Ingate Firewall® 4.8.1 Ingate SIParator® 4.8.1 | | --- | --- |   The new version can be found [here](/Upgrades.php)  ```  Release notice for Ingate Firewall(R) 4.8.1 and Ingate SIParator(R) 4.8.1  Release name: Ingate Firewall(R) 4.8.1               Ingate SIParator(R) 4.8.1 Release date: November 26, 2009  The new version and User Manuals can be found at: http://www.ingate.com/Upgrades.php  This is a major release with many new features, bug fixes and security fixes. We recommend everybody to upgrade.  * General change  *** "Firewall" and "SIParator" product operation are now user-     selectable through web GUI, CLI and startup tool. [Tracking ID:     3507]. Switching between Firewall and SIParator is now user      configurable on the SIParator Type page in the Web GUI, or      through the Start-Up Tool.  * New SIP-related features  *** Embedded SIP Test Agent. Test calls are manually initiated or     scheduled for periodic tests. A call is considered successful if     200 OK is received and at least 4 media packets are sent and     received.  [Tracking ID: 4125]  *** Embedded SIP Test Agent - Echo Server. An echo server listening to     a configured address answers all incoming calls and echoes back     the media. Hosts/networks allowed to access the Echo Server are     configurable. This feature is intended for usage with the embedded     Test Agent or any other test tool.  [Tracking ID: 4129]  *** Estimated MOS values are calculated for RTP streams. A MOS value     (0-5) is estimated for each call and sent in the RADIUS STOP     ticket. The MOS values are estimated based on CODEC (type,     parameters) and packet loss (distribution taken into     account).      New RADIUS attributes:     - IG-Acct-Input-Last-Payload-Type  Number describing CODEC used     - IG-Acct-Output-Last-Payload-Type     - IG-Acct-Input-Reordered          No of re-ordered RTP packts     - IG-Acct-Output-Reordered     - IG-Acct-Input-Comfort-Noise      Comfort Noise used (yes/no)     - IG-Acct-Output-Comfort-Noise     - IG-Acct-Input-Codec-Name         Name of CODEC used (e.g PCMU)     - IG-Acct-Output-Codec-Name     - IG-Acct-Input-Jitter-Max         Maximum jitter during the call     - IG-Acct-Output-Jitter-Max     [Tracking ID: 4269]  *** Additional attributes in RADIUS accounting messages. The following     additional SIP headers in the initial SIP INVITE will be reported     by the Ingate:      - Remote-Party-Id     - P-Asserted-Identity     - Diversion      The value of the header field will be sent as "raw" unformatted data.      (In cases of several similar headers, the first will be reported.      [Tracking ID: 4458]  *** Wildcard patterns can be used for domains in DNS override. Only     patters starting with * are supported. [Tracking ID: 4226]  *** Rewriting FROM-header in the Dial-Plan. Rewrite of the From header     is enabled by adding a ";from=" parameter to the Forward To Reg     Expr field in the same way ";b2bua" can be used today.      The from parameter may contain references to Reg Expr sub-strings     in "Forward To", except the string may both reference sub strings     in "From Header", and Request-URI Reg Exprs. Sub strings of the     From header are referenced as $fx, x >= 0. And Request-URI sub     strings as $rx, x >= 0.      The from parameter may also contain the following references "$()":     - ruri.user     - ruri.host     - to.user     - to.host     - from.user     - from.host     - ip.      Where iface is the name of a network interface, i.e. one of eth0,     eth1 etc.      Examples:      1) Replace From domain with IP of interface eth1:        from="$(from.user)@$(ip.eth1)"      2) Replace From domain with example.com:        from="$(from.user)@example.com"     [Tracking ID: 2765]  *** "Refer-To replacement domain" is used in attended transfers     too. This was a new feature in 4.7.0, which replaces the domain in     Refer-To headers of REFER requests for unattended transfers. In     4.8 this behaviour can be used in attended transfers too.      The Refer-To headers of REFER for attended transfers normally     contain the remote target of a dialog which don't need this     setting. But some SIP devices use an AOR in the Refer-To header     for attended transfers.  [Tracking ID: 4394]  *** Wildcard matching of TLS certificates according to RFC 2818. It is     now supported to use wildcard matching of subjectAltName and CN in     TLS certificates. [Tracking ID: 4224]  *** Fake support of "privacy" option tag. "privacy" is added as a     supported options tag. And as a result the sip module will forward     requests containing "Proxy-Require: privacy". The headers     Remote-Party-ID and RPID-Privacy are forwarded by the proxy, but     otherwise ignored.      In the case of the B2BUA, both Proxy-Require and Remote-Party-ID     are removed (but RPID-Privacy is kept) before the requests are     forwarded.  [Tracking ID: 4460]  *** INFOs with Content-Type application/media_control+xml are ignored     by the B2BUA and responses with 200 (OK) are sent.  [Tracking ID:     4456]  *** 491 (Request Pending) to Re-INVITEs are delayed on one call leg,     if an outgoing Re-INVITE has been sent on the other leg. Instead     the Ingate will wait some time before responding to allow a pending     request on the other leg to complete.  [Tracking ID: 4384]  *** Improved interoperability between RFC 2543 and RFC 3264 peers     regarding onhold. Ingate complies with RFC 3264 and answers an SDP     containing "inactive" with an SDP containing "inactive" even if the     other peer didn't include the "inactive" (RFC 2543).  [Tracking     ID: 4390]  *** New re-INVITEs are now delayed until an ACK is received from       the previous re-INVITE.  [Tracking ID: 4229]  * Other new features  *** An SNMP trap is sent when time-limited licenses expire.     Tracking ID: 4263   * Fixed Security problems  *** Fixed two remotely exploitable bugs in the ASN.1 parser of     Openswan. This is CVE-2009-2185 and is fixed in Openswan 2.4.15.     [Tracking ID: 4356]  *** The Bonk attack (aka ping of death) was not satisfactorily      handled according to ICSA.     [Tracking ID: 4312]  *** Fixed man-in-the-middle vulnerability for SSL and TLS by     disabling renegotiations. This is CVE-2009-3555.     [Tracking ID: 4471]  * Fixed SIP-related bugs  *** The B2BUA unexpectedly changed the From URI when NAT:ing as an     alias address.  [Tracking ID: 4252]  *** The SIP module failed to start if a static route was configured to     a network behind a router on a VLAN unless the physical ethernet     interface also was configured with an IP address.  [Tracking ID:     4397]  *** Route header was not removed in retransmission of stateless ACK     (2xx) [Tracking ID: 4402]  * Fixed CLI-related bugs  *** The reboot-command uploaded via the GUI in a CLI file containing     "reboot --now" works as expected.  [Tracking ID: 4465]  * Other  *** The Mediator mode for the Ingate SIParator(R) has been removed and     is no longer supported.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : strongswan
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1957 CVE-2009-1958 CVE-2009-2185 CVE-2009-2661
Debian Bug     : 531612 533837 540144

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in strongswan, an
implementation of the IPSEC and IKE protocols.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2009-1957
CVE-2009-1958

The charon daemon can crash when processing certain crafted IKEv2
packets.  (The old stable distribution (etch) was not affected by
these two problems because it lacks IKEv2 support.)

CVE-2009-2185
CVE-2009-2661

The pluto daemon could crash when processing a crafted X.509
certificate.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.8.0+dfsg-1+etch2.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.4-5+lenny3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.2-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.

Upgrade instructions

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
