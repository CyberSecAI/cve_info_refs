Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2847:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided documents directly mention CVE-2009-2847 and describe an information leak vulnerability related to the `sigaltstack` function in the Linux kernel. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way the `do_sigaltstack` function in the Linux kernel copies the `stack_t` structure to user space. Specifically, on 64-bit systems, the kernel doesn't clear padding bytes within this structure. This padding can contain sensitive information residing on the kernel stack.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Leak:** The vulnerability results in the disclosure of uninitialized kernel stack data to user space. This could leak up to 4 bytes.
*   **Improper Padding Handling:** The kernel fails to properly handle padding bytes within the `stack_t` structure during the copy operation.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A local user can exploit this vulnerability to leak information from the kernel stack. This leaked information could potentially be used in further attacks.
*   **Loss of Privacy:** Sensitive information residing on the kernel stack is exposed to a local attacker, resulting in loss of privacy.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   **Local access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local user with the ability to make system calls.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system as a local user.
*   **System call access:** The attacker must be able to make the `sigaltstack` system call.
* **64-bit Architecture**: The vulnerability is specific to 64 bit systems due to the padding within the `stack_t` struct.

**Technical details and descriptions from content:**

*   **Red Hat Bugzilla (Bug 515392):**  This entry confirms the vulnerability and includes links to the upstream fix. It also notes that the issue is an information leak in `sigaltstack`. It provides the upstream commit details.
*   **Openwall Mailing List:**  The email exchange discusses the vulnerability, including the fact that Ulrich Drepper identified the issue and that a fix was included in a certain Linux kernel version. It also mentions the vulnerability might affect 2.4 kernels.
*   **Exploit-DB:** Provides an exploit code (`sigaltstack-leak.c`) that demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability and leak kernel stack memory. The code also explicitly mentions that "Only 4 bytes of uninitialized kernel stack are leaked in the padding between stack_t's ss_flags and ss_size. The disclosure only affects affects 64-bit hosts."
*   **Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2009:1243):** The advisory mentions CVE-2009-2847 as a flaw found in the way the `do_sigaltstack()` function copies the `stack_t` structure to user space, resulting in a four-byte information leak.
*   **Ubuntu Security Notice:** USN-852-1 indicates that a vulnerability exists with the `sigaltstack`, and mentions it can allow a local attacker to send crafted calls to expose 4 bytes of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.
* **VMware Advisory:** VMSA-2009-0016 contains a large number of vulnerabilities including CVE-2009-2847. It mentions that updates to the ESX service console address a number of third-party components which includes the linux kernel and a description of what the update addresses.

In summary, the vulnerability is a local information leak due to improper handling of the `stack_t` structure within the `do_sigaltstack` function on 64-bit Linux kernels.
