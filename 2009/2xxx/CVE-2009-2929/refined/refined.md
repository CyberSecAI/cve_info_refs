The provided content from Exploit Database details multiple vulnerabilities in tgs CMS 0.x, and it includes the CVE ID 2009-2929. This confirms the content is related to the specified CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering web pages. Specifically, the `previous_page` parameter in `login.php` is vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Lack of input sanitization and output encoding.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts (JavaScript) into the web page viewed by other users. This could lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions performed on behalf of the victim.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Maliciously crafted URL with XSS payload injected into the `previous_page` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft URLs with malicious JavaScript code. Requires a victim to click on a link or browse to the crafted page.

**2. SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:**  User-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries in `index.php`. Vulnerable parameters include `tgs_language_id`, `tpl_dir`, `referer`, `user-agent`, `site`, `option`, `db_optimization`, `owner`, `admin_email`, `default_language`, and `db_host`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of parameterized queries or input sanitization for SQL statements.
*    **Impact:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database queries. This could allow them to read or modify sensitive data, potentially gain control of the database server, or conduct other database attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Maliciously crafted URLs with SQL injection payloads in the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to craft malicious SQL injection strings. No authentication required.

**3. Blind SQL/XPath Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** Similar to SQL injection, but the application does not return any output related to the query result. The attacker must infer results using techniques such as timing attacks. Vulnerable parameters are present in `frontpage_ception.php` including `cmd`, `s_dir`, `minutes`, `s_mask`, `test3_mp`, `test15_file1`, `submit`, `brute_method`, `ftp_server_port`, `userfile14`, `subj`, `mysql_l`, `action`, `userfile1`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** User-supplied input is not properly sanitized and is passed into SQL/XPath queries.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL/XPath statements. This could allow them to compromise the database and/or expose sensitive information.
*  **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted URLs with SQL/XPath injection payloads in the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to craft malicious SQL/XPath injection strings and perform timing attacks or analyze other side-channels. No authentication required.

**4. Source Code Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The source code of certain PHP files, including `index.php` (when `site=admin`) and `admin.php`, is directly accessible through the web server.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Inadequate access controls on server-side files.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can view the application's source code, which might contain sensitive information like database credentials, application logic, and other details useful for further attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to files via web server.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to access the files through the web server. No authentication is required.

In summary, this content provides detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, Blind SQL/XPath injection, and source code disclosure) within the tgs CMS 0.x application, along with example attack vectors and fixes.
