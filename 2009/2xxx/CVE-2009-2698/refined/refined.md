  "CVE-2009-2698": {
    "Root cause": "A flaw in the udp_sendmsg() implementation when using the MSG_MORE flag on UDP sockets.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The Linux kernel's udp_sendmsg() implementation doesn't properly handle the MSG_MORE flag on UDP sockets.",
      "This results in a NULL pointer dereference.",
      "Incorrect initialization of the sendpage operation within the proto_ops structure."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local, unprivileged user could cause a local denial of service or escalate their privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access is required.",
      "Exploitation involves a specially crafted sequence of calls to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to execute code locally on the vulnerable system."
