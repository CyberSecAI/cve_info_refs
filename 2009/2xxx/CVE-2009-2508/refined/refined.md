Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2508:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient session management validation in Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). Specifically, ADFS doesn't properly discard authentication credentials when a user logs off, leaving them available for reuse.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Session hijacking/spoofing: An attacker can reuse a previous user's authentication token to impersonate that user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could impersonate an authenticated user, gaining access to web resources as that user. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or actions taken on behalf of the compromised user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs access to a workstation and browser that was recently used by the targeted user to access a website using ADFS single sign-on.
- The attacker must obtain the authentication token from the browser's cache or other location where it may be accessible.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to a shared workstation such as an Internet kiosk where the victim previously logged into an ADFS-secured website.
- The attacker must be able to extract the authentication token from the browser.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability is specific to systems using ADFS for single sign-on.
- The attack is only possible before the session times out on the server (default 600 minutes). After this timeout, the token becomes invalid for reuse.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" in severity.
- The provided patch addresses the issue by properly discarding authentication credentials when a user logs off the network.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited before the release of the security bulletin.
