Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** flaw present in the `dit.cms` version 1.3. The application improperly handles user-supplied input in multiple locations, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*  The vulnerability exists because of the `register_globals = on` setting in PHP, which allows attacker-controlled parameters to directly overwrite application variables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI, where the application includes files based on user-controlled parameters.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `path`, `sitemap`, and `relPath` parameters, allowing for directory traversal attacks using `../` sequences and null byte injection.
*   **`register_globals = on`:** This PHP setting contributes to the vulnerability as it allows attacker-controlled parameters to directly overwrite application variables and influence code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive configuration files, source code, and other confidential data, like boot.ini in Windows systems.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** LFI vulnerabilities can sometimes be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on the server configuration and accessible files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attacker sends crafted HTTP GET requests to various vulnerable scripts within the `dit.cms` application.
*   **URL Parameters:** The attacker injects malicious file paths into the `path`, `sitemap`, and `relPath` parameters of the URL to trigger the inclusion vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable `dit.cms` application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Understanding of HTTP requests and how to manipulate URL parameters is required.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided PoCs demonstrate that the vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit examples provided use directory traversal (`../`) sequences along with a null byte injection (`%00`) to bypass any potential filtering mechanisms, although not explicitly mentioned if there were any filters present.
*   Multiple scripts within `dit.cms` are vulnerable, including those located in `/path/install/`, `/path/menus/`, and `/path/index/`.
*   The `register_globals` setting is deprecated and disabled by default in modern PHP versions. It highlights that the vulnerable application was developed using an insecure configuration of PHP.
