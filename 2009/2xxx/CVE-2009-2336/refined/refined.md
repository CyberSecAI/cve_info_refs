    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-2336",
      "description": "WordPress discriminates bad password from bad user logins, this reduces the complexity of a brute force attack on WordPress blogs login (CVE-2009-2335, BID 35584). The same user information disclosure happens when users use the forgotten mail interface to request a new password (CVE-2009-2336, same BID 35584). These information disclosures seem to be previously reported [6] but the WordPress team is refusing to modify them alleging *user convenience*.",
      "root_cause": "The application differentiates between invalid usernames and invalid passwords during the login process and password reset process, which provides an attacker with information to perform targeted attacks.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Information disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can determine valid usernames by observing the different responses from failed login attempts and during the password reset process. This reduces the complexity of a brute-force attack on WordPress logins.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Login page",
        "Password reset interface"
