The provided content is related to a vulnerability described as "Pretty-Bad-Proxy" (PBP).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that browsers' rendering modules, which operate above the HTTP/HTTPS layer, were not designed with the "Pretty-Bad-Proxy" (PBP) threat model in mind. This means that browsers may be susceptible to attacks that manipulate the rendered content even if the underlying HTTPS connection is secure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by a malicious proxy (PBP) that targets the browser's rendering modules. Specifically, PBP can:
*   Steal sensitive data from an HTTPS server.
*   Fake an HTTPS page.
*   Impersonate an authenticated user to access an HTTPS server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to a complete compromise of the end-to-end security guarantees of HTTPS, even when the cryptographic layer remains unbroken. This means an attacker could gain access to a user's sensitive data, potentially including login credentials or other personal information, by manipulating how the page is rendered.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious proxy that can sniff browser traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be positioned in the network such that they can act as a proxy and intercept the victim's browser traffic. The attacker does not need to break the underlying cryptographic scheme of HTTPS.
