        "field": "Root cause of vulnerability",
        "content": "The vulnerability is caused by an attempt to allocate a very large string buffer when handling long Unicode strings which leads to an uncaught exception on Windows, an unchecked malloc failure on Mac (in ATSUI system library), or an abort in system libraries (pango, glib, libc) on Linux. Specifically, on MacOS, `CTLineCreateWithAttributedString` fails, and the code dereferences a null pointer."

      {
        "field": "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present",
        "content": "The main vulnerability is a lack of proper handling when allocating very large strings in the browser, leading to a denial-of-service. On Mac, a lack of checks on memory allocation results leads to a crash within Apple's code (ATSUI). The issue arises during text processing, where an attempt is made to allocate a very large string which exceeds the available memory, resulting in a crash. There is also a possibility of unchecked `malloc` failure on the Mac."

      {
        "field": "Impact of exploitation",
        "content": "The primary impact is a denial-of-service, where the browser crashes or hangs, rendering it unusable. On Windows, Firefox terminates safely, though a crash occurs. On Mac, the browser crashes within system libraries. On Linux, the behavior varies from crashing to hanging/high CPU usage. While the vulnerability causes crashes, analysis by Mozilla concluded it did not allow for arbitrary code execution (not exploitable)."

        "field": "Attack vectors",
        "content": "The attack vector is through a web page containing a very long Unicode string processed by the browser, triggering the memory allocation failure. The exploit can be delivered through a website, and the browser will attempt to render the malicious content, resulting in the crash."

      {
        "field": "Required attacker capabilities/position",
        "content": "The attacker only needs to be able to create and host a web page containing the malicious, long unicode string. No special position or elevated privileges are needed. A user visiting the malicious website is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability."
