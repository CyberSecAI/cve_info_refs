Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-2855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `strListGetItem` function in `src/HttpHeaderTools.c` of Squid.
- This function is used to parse header values extracted using the `external_acl_type` with the format `%{header:<delimiter>member}`.
- The issue arises when the specified `<delimiter>` is not a comma (`,`). The code incorrectly handles this case.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Infinite loop:** When a non-comma delimiter is used in the `external_acl_type` header extraction, the `strListGetItem` function enters an infinite loop of calls to the `strcspn` function.
- **Incorrect delimiter handling:** The code uses `strcspn` to parse header fields expecting a comma as a delimiter, even when a different delimiter is specified by the user in the configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop consumes excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. The Squid process becomes unresponsive and stops processing legitimate requests.
- **100% CPU usage:**  The vulnerability causes the Squid process to utilize 100% of the CPU, further exacerbating the DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted HTTP request:** Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the Squid proxy server.
- **`external_acl_type` configuration:** The vulnerability is only exploitable if the Squid configuration includes an `external_acl_type` directive that uses the  `%{header:<delimiter>member}` format with a non-comma delimiter.
- **Header Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the HTTP request headers to insert values that will trigger the infinite loop when parsed by `strListGetItem`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the targeted Squid proxy server.
- **Knowledge of Squid configuration:**  The attacker needs to know if the target squid instance is configured to use `external_acl_type` with a header extraction that includes a non-comma delimiter. This is often used to extract cookie details.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability affects various versions of Squid, including 2.7, 2.6 and possibly older versions due to the nature of the vulnerable code.
- The vulnerability is not related to authentication mechanisms directly but rather how headers are parsed during access control using external ACLs.
- The original report was made against Squid 2.7, but the issue was found to be present across various versions due to the way header parsing was implemented.
- Patches have been released upstream and backported to older versions, including Debian stable distributions.
- Red Hat rated the issue as having a low severity, but some users experienced severe DoS conditions in production systems.
- A sample test case involves using a helper script, `external_acl_type` and a specially crafted header with a non-comma delimiter in the `squidclient` request to trigger the loop.
