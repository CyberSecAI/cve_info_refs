Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerabilities in MIM:InfiniX 1.2.003:

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, the `month` and `year` GET parameters in `index.php?mode=calendar` and search form data are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple locations, including GET parameters `month`, `year`  and search form data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as database version, username, and potentially table names.
*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers can retrieve admin credentials (username and password) stored in the database, potentially gaining full control of the application.
*   **Data Manipulation:** While not explicitly demonstrated, SQL injection could allow an attacker to modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** By manipulating the `month` and `year` GET parameters in the URL when `mode=calendar`.
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** By injecting malicious SQL code into the search form's input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication.
*   The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting must be set to `off` for the exploitation to be successful.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit examples provided use `UNION ALL SELECT` to append attacker-controlled data to the results of the original query.
*   The provided exploits demonstrate how to retrieve the database version, database name, user and password from the `admin` table.
*  The exploit suggests the vulnerability may also exist in earlier versions of the software (<=?).
*   The vulnerability was reported and fixed quickly, with a patch released on 2009-04-28.
*  The exploit mentions a specific dork `"Developed by rbk"` that could help find vulnerable instances.
