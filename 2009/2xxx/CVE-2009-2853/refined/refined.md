Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2853:

**Summary:**

CVE-2009-2853 refers to a vulnerability in WordPress where direct requests to certain files in the `wp-admin` directory could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. This vulnerability was addressed in WordPress versions 2.8.3, 2.5.1-11+lenny1, and 2.0.10-1etch4.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper access control checks in several PHP files located in the `wp-admin` directory. These files were intended to be included by other WordPress components and not accessed directly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Direct File Access:** The vulnerability arises from the ability to directly access PHP files that should only be included by WordPress, bypassing the intended access control mechanisms.
*   **Missing `ABSPATH` check:** Specifically, the files lacked a check to ensure that the `ABSPATH` constant was defined. This constant is defined when WordPress is loaded correctly, and its absence indicates that the file was accessed directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** As described in the Debian Security Advisory, the vulnerability allows remote attackers to "gain privileges via certain direct requests." This implies that by directly accessing these files, an attacker might be able to perform actions they would not normally have authorization for. The specific impact would depend on the functions within the directly accessed file.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Direct access to these files could expose sensitive information or functionality that should be restricted to authorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit this by crafting direct HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHP files within the `wp-admin` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress instance.
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker would need to know the paths of the vulnerable files within the `wp-admin` directory.

**Technical Details (from Changesets):**

The provided changeset diffs show that the fix involved adding the following code to the top of the vulnerable files:

```php
// don't load directly
if ( !defined('ABSPATH') )
    die('-1');
```

This code checks if the `ABSPATH` constant is defined, and if not (indicating direct access), terminates the script execution, preventing unauthorized access.

**Affected Files:**

The following files were patched:

*   `wp-admin/admin-footer.php`
*   `wp-admin/edit-attachment-rows.php`
*   `wp-admin/edit-category-form.php`
*   `wp-admin/edit-form-advanced.php`
*   `wp-admin/edit-form-comment.php`
*   `wp-admin/edit-link-category-form.php`
*   `wp-admin/edit-link-form.php`
*   `wp-admin/edit-page-form.php`
*   `wp-admin/edit-post-rows.php`
*   `wp-admin/edit-tag-form.php`

**Additional Notes**

*   The fix was applied to both the main development branch (trunk) and the 2.8 branch as seen in the provided changeset logs.
*   The vulnerability is described in the Debian security advisory (DSA 1871-1), which indicates its severity.
*   The WordPress 2.8.3 security release addressed this issue along with others.
