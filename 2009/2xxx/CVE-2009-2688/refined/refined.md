These flaws, located in the glyphs-eimage.c file within the tiff_instantiate, png_instantiate, and jpeg_instantiate functions, can lead to heap-based buffer overflows when processing specially crafted TIFF, PNG, and JPEG files, respectively. The bug report also includes patches from Gentoo, which were integrated into Fedora updates. The severity is considered medium.",
