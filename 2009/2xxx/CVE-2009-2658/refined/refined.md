{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The znc IRC proxy did not properly process certain DCC requests, specifically when handling filenames in DCC SEND commands.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory Traversal vulnerability due to insufficient checks on filenames during DCC file transfers."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers could upload arbitrary files to locations on the server where ZNC had write access, potentially overwriting existing files or introducing new files.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through maliciously crafted DCC SEND requests. The attacker sends a DCC request with a filename that contains directory traversal characters (e.g., '../').",
    "required_capabilities": "A valid ZNC user account was sufficient to exploit the vulnerability. No admin privileges were required."
