```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses unsanitized user-supplied data in SQL queries and does not validate user input, leading to various vulnerabilities including SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Blind SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection via the `user_enter`, `enter_login`, and `enter_parol` cookies within the `/index.php` file
    - SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `topic` parameter in the `/message.php` file.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS via the `topic` parameter in `/message.php` and via the `v_variant1` parameter in `/add_voting.php`.
    - User Deletion Vulnerability: The application allows arbitrary user deletion using the `del_user_id` parameter in `/admin/edit_user.php`.
    - Path Disclosure: The application discloses file paths through multiple include files.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Arbitrary SQL queries can be executed leading to data exfiltration, manipulation, or complete database compromise.
    - Malicious scripts can be injected into the page, potentially leading to account compromise, session hijacking, or redirection to malicious sites.
    - Arbitrary user accounts can be deleted from the database.
    - File paths can be disclosed which may help an attacker gain further information about the server infrastructure.
- Attack vectors:
    - HTTP GET requests with crafted parameters
    - HTTP POST requests with crafted parameters and body.
    - Manipulation of cookies.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    - No authentication is required for exploiting most of the vulnerabilities. For the user deletion vulnerability, admin access is assumed to be obtained via the Blind SQL injection vulnerability.
