# RHSA-2012:1537 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: jasperreports-server-pro security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1537)

## Topic

An updated jasperreports-server-pro package that fixes one security issue
and various bugs is now available.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

JasperReports Server is a reporting server.

A flaw was found in the way the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser processed the
SYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using the
Apache Xerces2 Java Parser, would lead to a denial of service (application
hang due to excessive CPU use). (CVE-2009-2625)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Adding a user to any ROLE caused an unexpected exception. (BZ#730712)
* Previously, the jasperreports-server-pro RPM spec file contained the

"%{dist}" tag on the "Release" line. To comply with the packaging and
naming guidelines, the tag has been changed to "%{?dist}" with this update.
(BZ#868927)

* In some cases reports were opened with an incorrect list of

Entity/Entities. (BZ#842687)

Note: The jasperreports-server-pro package replaces rhevm-reports-server
from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0.

Users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these
issues.

## Solution

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Overview

Oracle products and components are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service.

The [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2009](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpuoct2009.html) addresses 16 vulnerabilities in various Oracle products and components. The document provides information about affected components, access and authorization required for successful exploitation, and the impact from the vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Oracle has associated CVE identifiers with the vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update. If significant additional details about vulnerabilities and remediation techniques become available, we will update the [Vulnerability Notes Database](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/).

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information.

### Solution

Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2009](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpuoct2009.html). Note that this document only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for previously known issues are not listed.

## Minimize business risk across the entire SDLC

Every business is a software business. Whether you’re selling it directly to your customers or relying on it to run your operations, Black Duck helps you protect your bottom line by building trust in your software—at the speed your business demands.

![<p>Your software is assembled as well as created. It includes more than open source and proprietary code. To build software users can trust, you must address the security of everything that goes into it.</p>](/_jcr_content/root/synopsyscontainer/imagetextcta_1741576_1272199214.coreimg.svg/1725661318771/sig-secure.svg "Secure your software supply chain")

## Secure your software supply chain

Building applications that users can trust requires securing everything that goes into it. Comply with supply chain requirements through comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management and eliminate risks throughout the application development life cycle.

**[Protect every aspect of your software](/solutions/software-supply-chain-security.html)**

![<p>Transforming your business through software requires speed and agility. Orchestrating and correlating your tests ensures that security doesn’t slow you down, even across multiple tools and vendors.</p>](/_jcr_content/root/synopsyscontainer/imagetextcta_1741576.coreimg.svg/1725661338119/sig-achieve.svg "Build security into DevOps")

## Build security into DevOps

Transforming your business through software requires speed and agility. Maintain productivity with easy, developer-friendly solutions integrated and optimized for the needs of DevSecOps.

**[Deliver secure, high-quality code faster](/solutions/devsecops.html)**

![<p>Secure software requires more than just tools. You need to align your people, processes, and technology to address security risks based on your organization’s unique policies and business objectives.</p>](/_jcr_content/root/synopsyscontainer/imagetextcta_1741576_663562323.coreimg.svg/1725661358397/sig-build.svg "Manage AppSec risk at enterprise scale")

## Manage AppSec risk at enterprise scale

Managing risk at scale requires you to rein in tool sprawl and centralize policies and reporting to enable a single view of risk. Shift application security everywhere so you can improve your risk posture and your AppSec program’s total cost of ownership.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1984-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                        Giuseppe Iuculano
January 30, 2010                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Packages       : libxerces2-java
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2009-2625
Debian Bug     : 548358

It was discovered that libxerces2-java, a validating XML parser for Java,
does not properly process malformed XML files.
This vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service while parsing
a malformed XML file.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.1-1+etch1.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.1-2+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.1-4.1, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxerces2-java package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-openjdk packages that fix several security issues and a
bug are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
contains the software and tools that users need to run applications written
using the Java programming language.

A flaw was found in the way the XML Digital Signature implementation in the
JRE handled HMAC-based XML signatures. An attacker could use this flaw to
create a crafted signature that could allow them to bypass authentication,
or trick a user, applet, or application into accepting untrusted content.
(CVE-2009-0217)

Several potential information leaks were found in various mutable static
variables. These could be exploited in application scenarios that execute
untrusted scripting code. (CVE-2009-2475)

It was discovered that OpenType checks can be bypassed. This could allow a
rogue application to bypass access restrictions by acquiring references to
privileged objects through finalizer resurrection. (CVE-2009-2476)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way the JRE processes XML. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to supply crafted XML that would lead
to a denial of service. (CVE-2009-2625)

A flaw was found in the JRE audio system. An untrusted applet or
application could use this flaw to gain read access to restricted System
properties. (CVE-2009-2670)

Two flaws were found in the JRE proxy implementation. An untrusted applet
or application could use these flaws to discover the usernames of users
running applets and applications, or obtain web browser cookies and use
them for session hijacking attacks. (CVE-2009-2671, CVE-2009-2672)

An additional flaw was found in the proxy mechanism implementation. This
flaw allowed an untrusted applet or application to bypass access
restrictions and communicate using non-authorized socket or URL connections
to hosts other than the origin host. (CVE-2009-2673)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the JRE processes JPEG
images. An untrusted application could use this flaw to extend its
privileges, allowing it to read and write local files, as well as to
execute local applications with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2009-2674)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the JRE unpack200 functionality. An
untrusted applet or application could extend its privileges, allowing it to
read and write local files, as well as to execute local applications with
the privileges of the user running the applet or application. (CVE-2009-2675)

It was discovered that JDK13Services grants unnecessary privileges to
certain object types. This could be misused by an untrusted applet or
application to use otherwise restricted functionality. (CVE-2009-2689)

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way private Java variables
were handled. An untrusted applet or application could use this flaw to
obtain information from variables that would otherwise be private.
(CVE-2009-2690)

Note: The flaws concerning applets in this advisory, CVE-2009-2475,
CVE-2009-2670, CVE-2009-2671, CVE-2009-2672, CVE-2009-2673, CVE-2009-2675,
CVE-2009-2689, and CVE-2009-2690, can only be triggered in
java-1.6.0-openjdk by calling the "appletviewer" application.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* the EVR in the java-1.6.0-openjdk package as shipped with Red Hat

Enterprise Linux allowed the java-1.6.0-openjdk package from the EPEL
repository to take precedence (appear newer). Users using
java-1.6.0-openjdk from EPEL would not have received security updates since
October 2008. This update prevents the packages from EPEL from taking
precedence. (BZ#499079)

All users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Based on the above -^ I would vote for separate CVE identifier for expat flaw
(and its embedded copies in dozen of packages):

<https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280615#c8>
<https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280615#c10>

To remember sounding of CVE-2009-2625:
---------------------------------------

Apache Xerces2 Java, as used in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK
and JRE 6 before Update 15 and JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update 20, and
in other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(infinite loop and application hang) via malformed XML input, as
demonstrated by the Codenomicon XML fuzzing framework.

Argumentation for new CVE id:
-----------------------------
a, CVE-2009-2625 doesn't mention expat (just "other products", this could
    be fixed though)
b, The impact differs on Apache Xerces2 Java (infinite loop and application
    hang, 100% cpu use -- have checked unpatched java-1.6.0-openjdk) and in expat
    (clean crash) - gdb output attached for both testcases.

Steve, Josh, which way would be easier to follow?
i, mention expat in CVE-2009-2625, change impact to DoS (crash)
    via malformed XML file, which triggers UTF-8 parser crash? or
ii. assign new CVE id for expat (and its embedded copies) with
     clean impact description and note that crash happens in UTF-8
     parser?

Opinions, ACKs, NACKs appreciated.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hello Steven,

are you going to assign a new identifier for expat updatePosition crash?
It seems to me the outcome of this discussion is that the issues
discovered in 2009 by the Codenomicon XML fuzzing and in 2008 by Peter
Valchev are identical, and that the CVE-2009-2625 wording is limited to
the infinite loop in a Java codebase. As a supporting factor,
CVE-2009-2625 is used by many to identify only the Java issues
(with Mandriva being an exception).

- libmozhelper-1\_0-0/mozilla-xulrunner190
The Moblin web browser engine was updated to the Firefox equivalent
version 3.5.9.
Following security issues were fixed in 3.5.9:
MFSA 2010-16: Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability
bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
References
Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, and Jesse Ruderman reported crashes in the
browser engine that affected Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6. (CVE-2010-0173)
Jesse Ruderman and Ehsan Akhgari reported crashes that affected all
supported versions of the browser engine. (CVE-2010-0174)
MFSA 2010-17 / CVE-2010-0175:
Security researcher regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day
Initiative that a select event handler for XUL tree items could be called
after the tree item was deleted. This results in the execution of
previously freed memory which an attacker could use to crash a victim's
browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-18 / CVE-2010-0176: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the way elements are
inserted into a XUL tree optgroup. In certain cases, the number of
references to an element is under-counted so that when the element is
deleted, a live pointer to its old location is kept around and may later
be used. An attacker could potentially use these conditions to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2010-19 / CVE-2010-0177: Security researcher regenrecht reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative an error in the implementation of the
window.navigator.plugins object. When a page reloads, the plugins array
would reallocate all of its members without checking for existing
references to each member. This could result in the deletion of objects
for which valid pointers still exist. An attacker could use this
vulnerability to crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the
victim's machine.
MFSA 2010-20 / CVE-2010-0178: Security researcher Paul Stone reported
that a browser applet could be used to turn a simple mouse click into a
drag-and-drop action, potentially resulting in the unintended loading of
resources in a user's browser. This behavior could be used twice in
succession to first load a privileged chrome: URL in a victim's browser,
then load a malicious javascript: URL on top of the same document
resulting in arbitrary script execution with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2010-21 / CVE-2010-0179: Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4
reported that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module in the Firebug add-on was
exposing an underlying chrome privilege escalation vulnerability. When
the XMLHttpRequestSpy object was created, it would attach various
properties of itself to objects defined in web content, which were not
being properly wrapped to prevent their exposure to chrome privileged
objects. This could result in an attacker running arbitrary JavaScript
on a victim's machine, though it required the victim to have Firebug
installed, so the overall severity of the issue was determined to be
High.
MFSA 2010-22 / CVE-2009-3555: Mozilla developers added support in the
Network Security Services module for preventing a type of
man-in-the-middle attack against TLS using forced renegotiation.
Note that to benefit from the fix, Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 3.5 users
will need to set their security.ssl.require\_safe\_negotiation preference
to true. Firefox 3 does not contain the fix for this issue.
MFSA 2010-23 / CVE-2010-0181: phpBB developer Henry Sudhof reported that
when an image tag points to a resource that redirects to a mailto: URL,
the external mail handler application is launched. This issue poses no
security threat to users but could create an annoyance when browsing a
site that allows users to post arbitrary images.
MFSA 2010-24 / CVE-2010-0182: Mozilla community member Wladimir Palant
reported that XML documents were failing to call certain security checks
when loading new content. This could result in certain resources being
loaded that would otherwise violate security policies set by the browser
or installed add-ons.
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.1
- libopenssl-devel
This update adds support for RFC5746 TLS renegotiations to address
vulnerabilities tracked as (CVE-2009-3555).

newer Mozilla-based products and ported them to the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch
so they can be utilized by Thunderbird 2 and SeaMonkey 1.1.
Paul Fisher reported a crash when joined to an Active Directory server
under Vista or Windows 7 and using SSPI authentication.
(CVE-2010-0161)
Ludovic Hirlimann reported a crash indexing some messages with

Carsten Book reported a crash in the JavaScript engine
(CVE-2009-3075)
Josh Soref reported a crash in the BinHex decoder used on non-Mac
platforms.
(CVE-2009-3072)
monarch2000 reported an integer overflow in a base64 decoding function
(CVE-2009-2463)
MFSA 2009-68 / CVE-2009-3983: Security researcher Takehiro Takahashi of
the IBM
X-Force reported that Mozilla's NTLM implementation was vulnerable to
reflection attacks in which NTLM credentials from one application could be
forwarded to another arbitary application via the browser. If an attacker
could get a user to visit a web page he controlled he could force NTLM
authenticated requests to be forwarded to another application on behalf
of the user.
MFSA 2009-62 / CVE-2009-3376:
Mozilla security researchers Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm reported that
when downloading a file containing a right-to-left override character
(RTL) in the filename, the name displayed in the dialog title bar
conflicts with the name of the file shown in the dialog body. An attacker
could use this vulnerability to obfuscate the name and file extension of
a file to be downloaded and opened, potentially causing a user to run an
executable file when they expected to open a non-executable file.
MFSA 2009-59 / CVE-2009-0689:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the
execution of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus
be leveraged by the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
Update: The underlying flaw in the dtoa routines used by Mozilla appears to
be essentially the same as that reported against the libc gdtoa routine by
Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
MFSA 2010-06 / CVE-2009-3385:
Security researcher Georgi Guninski reported that scriptable plugin
content, such as Flash objects, could be loaded and executed in SeaMonkey
mail messages by embedding the content in an iframe inside the message.
If a user were to reply to or forward such a message, malicious
JavaScript embedded in the plugin content could potentially steal the
contents of the message or files from the local filesystem.
MFSA 2009-49 / CVE-2009-3077:
An anonymous security researcher, via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative,
reported that the columns of a XUL tree element could be manipulated in a
particular way which would leave a pointer owned by the column pointing
to freed memory. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to
crash a victim's browser and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

to CVE-2009-2625, or other recent XML parser flaws. Therefore our take
is that it should have a distinct CVE entry.

### Overview

Oracle products and components are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service.

The [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2010](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpujan2010.html) addresses 24 vulnerabilities in various Oracle products and components. The document provides information about affected components, access and authorization required for successful exploitation, and the impact from the vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Oracle has associated CVE identifiers with the vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update. If significant additional details about vulnerabilities and remediation techniques become available, we will update the [Vulnerability Notes Database](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/).

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information.

### Solution

Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2010](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpujan2010.html). Note that this document only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for previously known issues are not listed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=515890#c0)  Marc Schoenefeld    2009-08-06 09:09:04 UTC  ``` A security vulnerability in the JNLPAppletLauncher may impact users of the Sun JDK and JRE. Non-current versions of the JNLPAppletLauncher may be re-purposed with an untrusted Java applet to write arbitrary files on the system of the user downloading and running the untrusted applet.  The JNLPAppletLauncher is a general purpose JNLP-based applet launcher class for deploying applets that use extension libraries containing native code.  <http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-263490-1>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=515890#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-06 20:38:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Extras for RHEL 4   Extras for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1199 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1199.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=515890#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-06 20:42:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Extras for RHEL 4   Extras for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1200 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1200.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=515890#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-12 18:15:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Extras for RHEL 4   Extras for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1582 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1582.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=515890#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-11 13:43:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.1  Via RHSA-2009:1662 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1662.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=515890#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-01-14 16:32:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.3  Via RHSA-2010:0043 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0043.html>   ``` |  |

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- php5
php5 has been updated to fix problems with SSL certificate
validation and overflows in the exif and gd modules
(CVE-2009-3291,CVE-2009-3292, CVE-2009-3293, CVE-2009-2687).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- newt
A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way newt used to process
content, to be rendered in text dialog box. Local attacker could issue
a specially-crafted text dialog box rendering request (direct or via
custom application), leading to denial of service (application crash)
or, potentially, to execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running the application (CVE-2009-2905).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- rubygem-actionpack
This update improves the escaping in the helper code of Ruby on
Rails to protect against XSS attacks (CVE-2009-3009) and an
information leak (CVE-2009-3086).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.1
- rubygem-activesupport
This update improves the escaping in the helper code of Ruby on
Rails to protect against XSS attacks (CVE-2009-3009) and an
information leak (CVE-2009-3086).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.1
- java-1\_4\_2-ibm
IBM Java 1.4.2 was updated to SR13 FP1.
It fixes following two security issues:
CVE-2009-2625: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with parsing XML data might allow a remote client to create a
denial-of-service condition on the system that the JRE runs on.
CVE-2008-5349: A vulnerability in how the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) handles certain RSA public keys might cause the JRE to consume
an excessive amount of CPU resources. This might lead to a Denial of
Service (DoS) condition on affected systems. Such keys could be
provided by a remote client of an application.
This issue affects the following security providers:
IBMJCE, IBMPKCS11Impl and IBMJCEFIPS.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11
- postgresql
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in PostgrSQL
- CVE-2009-3229: allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial
of service
- CVE-2009-3230: allows remote authenticated users to gain higher
privileges
- CVE-2009-3231: when using LDAP authentication with anonymous
binds, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an
empty password
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- samba
samba's make\_connection\_snum() handles certain input incorrectly,
which may lead to disclosure of the root directory (CVE-2009-2813).
Additionally an information disclosure vulnerability in mount.cifs
has been fixed (CVE-2009-2948) as well as a DoS condition
(CVE-2009-2906).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- phpMyAdmin
phpMyAdmin has been updated to version 2.11.9.6 to fix a cross-site
scripting (XSS) issue (CVE-2009-3696) and an SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2009-3697).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3, openSUSE 11.0
- viewvc
Update of viewvc to version 1.0.9 fixes a cross-site scripting (XSS)
problem and enhances filtering of illegal characters when displaying
error messages (CVE-2009-3618, CVE-2009-3619).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

## Topic

Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBEAP) 4.3 packages that fix
multiple security issues, several bugs, and add enhancements are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as JBEAP 4.3.0.CP07.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the market leading platform for
innovative and scalable Java applications; integrating the JBoss
Application Server, with JBoss Hibernate and JBoss Seam into a complete,
simple enterprise solution.

This release of JBEAP for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 serves as a
replacement to JBEAP 4.3.0.CP06.

These updated packages include bug fixes and enhancements which are
detailed in the Release Notes, available shortly from:
<http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/>

The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

A missing check for the recommended minimum length of the truncated form of
HMAC-based XML signatures was found in xml-security. An attacker could use
this flaw to create a specially-crafted XML file that forges an XML
signature, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication that is based on
the XML Signature specification. (CVE-2009-0217)

Swatej Kumar discovered cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws in the JBoss
Application Server Web Console. An attacker could use these flaws to
present misleading data to an authenticated user, or execute arbitrary
scripting code in the context of the authenticated user's browser session.
(CVE-2009-2405)

A flaw was found in the way the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser processed the
SYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using the
Apache Xerces2 Java Parser, would lead to a denial of service (application
hang due to excessive CPU use). (CVE-2009-2625)

An information leak flaw was found in the twiddle command line client. The
JMX password was logged in plain text to "twiddle.log". (CVE-2009-3554)

An XSS flaw was found in the JMX Console. An attacker could use this flaw
to present misleading data to an authenticated user, or execute arbitrary
scripting code in the context of the authenticated user's browser session.
(CVE-2009-1380)

Warning: Before applying this update, please backup the JBEAP
"server/[configuration]/deploy/" directory, and any other customized
configuration files.

All users of JBEAP 4.3 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 are advised to upgrade
to these updated packages.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- silc-toolkit
An update of slic-toolkit fixes a stack-based overflow that could be
triggered by encoding an ASN.1 OID (CVE-2008-7159) and several
format string bugs (CVE-2009-3051, CVE-2008-7160).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- open-iscsi

to spoof SSL servers (CVE-2009-2408).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- openldap2
openldap did not properly handle embedded NUL characters in X.509
certificates when comparing host names. Attackers could exploit that
to spoof SSL servers (CVE-2009-2408).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- cyrus-imapd
This update of cyrus-imapd fixes a buffer overflow that occurs in snprintf()
due to incorrectly calculating the size of the destination buffer.
(CVE-2009-2632)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
This update of java-1\_6\_0-openjdk fixes the following issues:
- CVE-2009-2670: OpenJDK Untrusted applet System properties access
- CVE-2009-2671,CVE-2009-2672: OpenJDK Proxy mechanism information leaks
- CVE-2009-2673: OpenJDK proxy mechanism allows non-authorized socket
connections
- CVE-2009-2674: Java Web Start Buffer JPEG processing integer overflow
- CVE-2009-2675: Java Web Start Buffer unpack200 processing integer overflow
- CVE-2009-2625: OpenJDK XML parsing Denial-Of-Service
- CVE-2009-2475: OpenJDK information leaks in mutable variables
- CVE-2009-2476: OpenJDK OpenType checks can be bypassed
- CVE-2009-2689: OpenJDK JDK13Services grants unnecessary privileges
- CVE-2009-2690: OpenJDK private variable information disclosure
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1
- postgresql
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in PostgrSQL
- CVE-2009-3229: allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial
of service
- CVE-2009-3230: allows remote authenticated users to gain higher
privileges
- CVE-2009-3231: when using LDAP authentication with anonymous
binds, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an
empty password
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- IBMJava2-JRE/java-1\_4\_2-ibm
IBM Java 1.4.2 was updated to SR13 FP1 to fix the following security
issues:
CVE-2009-2625: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with parsing XML data might allow a remote client to create a
denial-of-service condition on the system that the JRE runs on.
CVE-2008-5349: A vulnerability in how the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) handles certain RSA public keys might cause the JRE to consume
an excessive amount of CPU resources. This might lead to a Denial of
Service (DoS) condition on affected systems. Such keys could be
provided by a remote client of an application.
This issue affects the following security providers: IBMJCE,
IBMPKCS11Impl and IBMJCEFIPS.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLES9, SLE11
- wireshark
Specially crafted packets could crash the OPC UA dissector in
Wireshark (CVE-2009-3241)
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- freeradius
This update of freeradius fixes a remote denial-of-service bug in
function rad\_decode() which can be triggered by zero-length
Tunnel-Password attributes to make radiusd crash (CVE-2009-3111).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3, SLE10-SP2, SLES9
- dovecot
An update of dovecot fixes two buffer overflows in the sieve plug-in
(CVE-2009-2632, CVE-2009-3235)
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

c. Third party library update for ntp.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
this advisory.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant
for ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in this component (column 4) if a solution is available.

d. Service Console update for ntp

Service Console package ntp updated to version ntp-4.2.2pl-9el5\_3.2
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
The Service Console present in ESX is affected by the following
security issues.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
NTP authentication is not enabled by default on the Service Console.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A
malicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an
ntpq request that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ntpq
command.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0159 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in the Service Console (column 4) if a solution is available.

When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721

g. Updated Service Console package bind

Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5
The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these
issues.

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)

j. Updated Service Console package gnutls

Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5\_3.5
A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The IBM Java 6 JRE/SDK was updated to Service Release 6, fixing
various bugs and security issues.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2009-2676: A security vulnerability in the JNLPAppletLauncher
might impact users of the Sun JDK and JRE. Non-current versions of
the JNLPAppletLauncher might be re-purposed with an untrusted Java
applet to write arbitrary files on the system of the user downloading
and running the untrusted applet.
The JNLPAppletLauncher is a general purpose JNLP-based applet launcher
class for deploying applets that use extension libraries containing
native code.
CVE-2009-2493: The Java Runtime Environment includes the Java Web
Start technology that uses the Java Web Start ActiveX control to
launch Java Web Start in Internet Explorer. A security vulnerability
in the Active Template Library (ATL) in various releases of Microsoft
Visual Studio, which is used by the Java Web Start ActiveX control,
might allow the Java Web Start ActiveX control to be leveraged to
run arbitrary code. This might occur as the result of a user of the
Java Runtime Environment viewing a specially crafted web page that
exploits this vulnerability.
CVE-2009-2670: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment audio
system might allow an untrusted applet or Java Web Start application
to access system properties.
CVE-2009-0217: A vulnerability with verifying HMAC-based XML digital
signatures in the XML Digital Signature implementation included with
the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) might allow authentication to be
bypassed. Applications that validate HMAC-based XML digital signatures
might be vulnerable to this type of attack.
Note: This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an untrusted applet
or Java Web Start application.
CVE-2009-2671
CVE-2009-2672: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with
the SOCKS proxy implementation might allow an untrusted applet or
Java Web Start application to determine the user name of the user
running the applet or application.
A second vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with the
proxy mechanism implementation might allow an untrusted applet or
Java Web Start application to obtain browser cookies and leverage
those cookies to hijack sessions.
CVE-2009-2673: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with
the proxy mechanism implementation might allow an untrusted applet
or Java Web Start application to make non-authorized socket or URL
connections to hosts other than the origin host.
CVE-2009-2674: An integer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing JPEG images might allow an untrusted
Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example,
an untrusted application might grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or run local applications that are accessible to
the user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-2675: An integer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with unpacking applets and Java Web Start applications
using the unpack200 JAR unpacking utility might allow an untrusted
applet or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet might grant itself permissions to read and write local files
or run local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-2625: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) with parsing XML data might allow a remote client to create a
denial-of-service condition on the system that the JRE runs on.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of IBM Java after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi,
the upstream patch for CVE-2009-2625 for xerces-j2 is  java-only [1] and
unrelated to fixes in other native C parsing libraries.
