{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `pixaria.image.php` script of Pixaria Gallery 2.3.5. The script takes a `file` parameter, which is base64 encoded, and decodes it to include and display the content of an arbitrary local file, leading to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization or validation of the input, allowing a malicious user to access sensitive files on the server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Insufficient input validation",
    "Base64 encoding is not sufficient to protect against LFI"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server's file system. This may expose sensitive information, such as configuration files, database credentials, or other application-specific data. This can lead to further attacks, such as privilege escalation, data theft, or complete compromise of the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `pixaria.image.php` script. The `file` parameter of the GET request is used to specify the local file to include. The attacker crafts a malicious base64 encoded file path and sends it as a parameter. The vulnerable script will then decode the malicious path and display the content of the file in the response.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They also require knowledge of the server's file structure to specify the file they want to access. No special privileges on the target server are required."
