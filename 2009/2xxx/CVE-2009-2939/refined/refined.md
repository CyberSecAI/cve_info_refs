Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-2939:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions set on the `/var/spool/postfix/pid` directory by the `postinst` script during the installation of Postfix on Debian and Ubuntu systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Directory Permissions:** The `postinst` script grants write access to the `postfix` user for the `/var/spool/postfix/pid` directory, which is owned by `root` group. This should have been readable, but not writable by the `postfix` user.
*   **Symlink Vulnerability:** The write access granted to the `postfix` user allows them to create symlinks within the directory. This can be used to overwrite arbitrary files outside the directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A local attacker (specifically a user with the privileges of the `postfix` user) can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files on the system by creating malicious symlinks inside `/var/spool/postfix/pid`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have local access to the system with the privileges of the `postfix` user.
*   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker creates malicious symlinks inside `/var/spool/postfix/pid` that point to files they wish to overwrite elsewhere on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user with the privileges of the `postfix` user.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create symlinks and access the file system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is somewhat mitigated by the use of chroot in Debian and Ubuntu, which restricts the locations to which the attacker can create a symlink. However, this does not fully eliminate the risk.
*   The provided content includes a patch that modifies the permissions to prevent the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Wietse Venema.
