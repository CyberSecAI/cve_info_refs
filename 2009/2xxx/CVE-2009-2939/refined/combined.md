Package        : postfix
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-2939 CVE-2011-0411 CVE-2011-1720

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Postfix, a mail transfer
agent.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-2939
        The postinst script grants the postfix user write access to
        /var/spool/postfix/pid, which might allow local users to
        conduct symlink attacks that overwrite arbitrary files.

CVE-2011-0411
        The STARTTLS implementation does not properly restrict I/O
        buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert
        commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext
        command that is processed after TLS is in place.

CVE-2011-1720
        A heap-based read-only buffer overflow allows malicious
        clients to crash the smtpd server process using a crafted SASL
        authentication request.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.5-1.1+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.1-1+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postfix packages.

Subject: Insecure pid directory permissions for postfix on Debian / Ubuntu

Wietse Venema discovered that Debian and Ubuntu set the permissions of
/var/spool/postfix/pid to be postfix:root 0755. This allows the postfix
user to manipulate pid files and overwrite arbitrary files via symlink
attacks. Arbitrary file overwrites are somewhat mitigated when using
chroot, which is the default on Debian and Ubuntu.

Currently supported versions of Debian and Ubuntu that are affected are
(earlier versions are likely affected, but not checked):
Debian: 4.0 (Etch) and later
Ubuntu: 6.06 LTS (Dapper) and later

The patch is attached. This is CVE-2009-2939.
