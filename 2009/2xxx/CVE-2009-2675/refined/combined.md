1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- silc-toolkit
An update of slic-toolkit fixes a stack-based overflow that could be
triggered by encoding an ASN.1 OID (CVE-2008-7159) and several
format string bugs (CVE-2009-3051, CVE-2008-7160).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- open-iscsi
The iscsi\_discovery tool created predictable temporary files which
potentially allowed attackers to overwrite system files
(CVE-2009-1297).
Also some non-security bugs have been fixed:
- synchronize startup settings
- fix daemon segfault with CHAP
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE10-SP2, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- strongswan,freeswan,openswan
A previous fix for a flaw in the ASN.1 parser was incomplete and
had to be reworked (CVE-2009-2661).
This could lead to crashes of the pluto IKE daemon.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- mutt
mutt did not properly handle embedded NUL characters in X.509
certificates when comparing host names. Attackers could exploit that
to spoof SSL servers (CVE-2009-2408).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- openldap2
openldap did not properly handle embedded NUL characters in X.509
certificates when comparing host names. Attackers could exploit that
to spoof SSL servers (CVE-2009-2408).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- cyrus-imapd
This update of cyrus-imapd fixes a buffer overflow that occurs in snprintf()
due to incorrectly calculating the size of the destination buffer.
(CVE-2009-2632)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
This update of java-1\_6\_0-openjdk fixes the following issues:
- CVE-2009-2670: OpenJDK Untrusted applet System properties access
- CVE-2009-2671,CVE-2009-2672: OpenJDK Proxy mechanism information leaks
- CVE-2009-2673: OpenJDK proxy mechanism allows non-authorized socket
connections
- CVE-2009-2674: Java Web Start Buffer JPEG processing integer overflow
- CVE-2009-2675: Java Web Start Buffer unpack200 processing integer overflow
- CVE-2009-2625: OpenJDK XML parsing Denial-Of-Service
- CVE-2009-2475: OpenJDK information leaks in mutable variables
- CVE-2009-2476: OpenJDK OpenType checks can be bypassed
- CVE-2009-2689: OpenJDK JDK13Services grants unnecessary privileges
- CVE-2009-2690: OpenJDK private variable information disclosure
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1
- postgresql
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in PostgrSQL
- CVE-2009-3229: allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial
of service
- CVE-2009-3230: allows remote authenticated users to gain higher
privileges
- CVE-2009-3231: when using LDAP authentication with anonymous
binds, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an
empty password
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- IBMJava2-JRE/java-1\_4\_2-ibm
IBM Java 1.4.2 was updated to SR13 FP1 to fix the following security
issues:
CVE-2009-2625: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with parsing XML data might allow a remote client to create a
denial-of-service condition on the system that the JRE runs on.
CVE-2008-5349: A vulnerability in how the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) handles certain RSA public keys might cause the JRE to consume
an excessive amount of CPU resources. This might lead to a Denial of
Service (DoS) condition on affected systems. Such keys could be
provided by a remote client of an application.
This issue affects the following security providers: IBMJCE,
IBMPKCS11Impl and IBMJCEFIPS.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLES9, SLE11
- wireshark
Specially crafted packets could crash the OPC UA dissector in
Wireshark (CVE-2009-3241)
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- freeradius
This update of freeradius fixes a remote denial-of-service bug in
function rad\_decode() which can be triggered by zero-length
Tunnel-Password attributes to make radiusd crash (CVE-2009-3111).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3, SLE10-SP2, SLES9
- dovecot

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Advisory Details

August 5th, 2009
## Sun Java Pack200 Decoding Inner Class Count Integer Overflow Vulnerability

### ZDI-09-049ZDI-CAN-475

| CVE ID | [CVE-2009-2675](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2675) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Sun Microsystems](http://www.sun.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Java Runtime](http://java.sun.com/) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Sun Java Runtime. User interaction is required in that a target must visit a malicious web page or open a malicious JNLP file.  The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for handling Pack200 compressed JAR files. During decompression, several fields within a Pack200 header are trusted and used to calculate sizes for heap buffer allocations. By providing malicious values an attacker can create undersized heap buffers and subsequently overflow them. This can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user accessing the file or web page. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-263488-1> |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The Sun Java JRE /JDK 5 was updated to Update 20 fixing various
security issues.
CVE-2009-2670: The audio system in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
in JDK and JRE 6 before Update 15, and JDK and JRE 5.0 before Update
20, does not prevent access to java.lang.System properties by (1)
untrusted applets and (2) Java Web Start applications, which allows
context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading
these properties.
CVE-2009-2671: The SOCKS proxy implementation in Sun Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 before Update 15, and JDK and
JRE 5.0 before Update 20, allows remote attackers to discover the
user name of the account that invoked an untrusted (1) applet or (2)
Java Web Start application via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2009-2672: The proxy mechanism implementation in Sun Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 before Update 15, and JDK and
JRE 5.0 before Update 20, does not prevent access to browser cookies
by untrusted (1) applets and (2) Java Web Start applications, which
allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2009-2673: The proxy mechanism implementation in Sun Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 before Update 15, and JDK and JRE
5.0 before Update 20, allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
restrictions and connect to arbitrary sites via unspecified vectors,
related to a declaration that lacks the final keyword.
CVE-2009-2674: Integer overflow in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
in JDK and JRE 6 before Update 15 allows context-dependent attackers
to gain privileges via vectors involving an untrusted Java Web Start
application that grants permissions to itself, related to parsing of
JPEG images.
CVE-2009-2675: Integer overflow in the unpack200 utility in Sun Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 before Update 15, and JDK
and JRE 5.0 before Update 20, allows context-dependent attackers to
gain privileges via vectors involving an untrusted (1) applet or
(2) Java Web Start application that grants permissions to itself,
related to decompression.

modify arbitrary files via vectors involving an untrusted Java applet.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Sun Java and browsers running java plugins after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.

### Overview

Oracle products and components are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service.

The [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2009](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpuoct2009.html) addresses 16 vulnerabilities in various Oracle products and components. The document provides information about affected components, access and authorization required for successful exploitation, and the impact from the vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Oracle has associated CVE identifiers with the vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update. If significant additional details about vulnerabilities and remediation techniques become available, we will update the [Vulnerability Notes Database](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/).

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information.

### Solution

Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2009](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpuoct2009.html). Note that this document only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for previously known issues are not listed.

c. Third party library update for ntp.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
this advisory.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant
for ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0.

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

g. Updated Service Console package bind

Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5
The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
(column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these
issues.

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-2417 to this issue

j. Updated Service Console package gnutls

Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5\_3.5
A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-2730 to this issue
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-openjdk packages that fix several security issues and a
bug are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
contains the software and tools that users need to run applications written
using the Java programming language.

A flaw was found in the way the XML Digital Signature implementation in the
JRE handled HMAC-based XML signatures. An attacker could use this flaw to
create a crafted signature that could allow them to bypass authentication,
or trick a user, applet, or application into accepting untrusted content.
(CVE-2009-0217)

Several potential information leaks were found in various mutable static
variables. These could be exploited in application scenarios that execute
untrusted scripting code. (CVE-2009-2475)

It was discovered that OpenType checks can be bypassed. This could allow a
rogue application to bypass access restrictions by acquiring references to
privileged objects through finalizer resurrection. (CVE-2009-2476)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way the JRE processes XML. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to supply crafted XML that would lead
to a denial of service. (CVE-2009-2625)

A flaw was found in the JRE audio system. An untrusted applet or
application could use this flaw to gain read access to restricted System
properties. (CVE-2009-2670)

Two flaws were found in the JRE proxy implementation. An untrusted applet
or application could use these flaws to discover the usernames of users
running applets and applications, or obtain web browser cookies and use
them for session hijacking attacks. (CVE-2009-2671, CVE-2009-2672)

An additional flaw was found in the proxy mechanism implementation. This
flaw allowed an untrusted applet or application to bypass access
restrictions and communicate using non-authorized socket or URL connections
to hosts other than the origin host. (CVE-2009-2673)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the JRE processes JPEG
images. An untrusted application could use this flaw to extend its
privileges, allowing it to read and write local files, as well as to
execute local applications with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2009-2674)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the JRE unpack200 functionality. An
untrusted applet or application could extend its privileges, allowing it to
read and write local files, as well as to execute local applications with
the privileges of the user running the applet or application. (CVE-2009-2675)

It was discovered that JDK13Services grants unnecessary privileges to
certain object types. This could be misused by an untrusted applet or
application to use otherwise restricted functionality. (CVE-2009-2689)

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way private Java variables
were handled. An untrusted applet or application could use this flaw to
obtain information from variables that would otherwise be private.
(CVE-2009-2690)

Note: The flaws concerning applets in this advisory, CVE-2009-2475,
CVE-2009-2670, CVE-2009-2671, CVE-2009-2672, CVE-2009-2673, CVE-2009-2675,
CVE-2009-2689, and CVE-2009-2690, can only be triggered in
java-1.6.0-openjdk by calling the "appletviewer" application.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* the EVR in the java-1.6.0-openjdk package as shipped with Red Hat

Enterprise Linux allowed the java-1.6.0-openjdk package from the EPEL
repository to take precedence (appear newer). Users using
java-1.6.0-openjdk from EPEL would not have received security updates since
October 2008. This update prevents the packages from EPEL from taking
precedence. (BZ#499079)

All users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The IBM Java 6 JRE/SDK was updated to Service Release 6, fixing
various bugs and security issues.
Following security issues were fixed:
CVE-2009-2676: A security vulnerability in the JNLPAppletLauncher
might impact users of the Sun JDK and JRE. Non-current versions of
the JNLPAppletLauncher might be re-purposed with an untrusted Java
applet to write arbitrary files on the system of the user downloading
and running the untrusted applet.
The JNLPAppletLauncher is a general purpose JNLP-based applet launcher
class for deploying applets that use extension libraries containing
native code.
CVE-2009-2493: The Java Runtime Environment includes the Java Web
Start technology that uses the Java Web Start ActiveX control to
launch Java Web Start in Internet Explorer. A security vulnerability
in the Active Template Library (ATL) in various releases of Microsoft
Visual Studio, which is used by the Java Web Start ActiveX control,
might allow the Java Web Start ActiveX control to be leveraged to
run arbitrary code. This might occur as the result of a user of the
Java Runtime Environment viewing a specially crafted web page that
exploits this vulnerability.
CVE-2009-2670: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment audio
system might allow an untrusted applet or Java Web Start application
to access system properties.
CVE-2009-0217: A vulnerability with verifying HMAC-based XML digital
signatures in the XML Digital Signature implementation included with
the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) might allow authentication to be
bypassed. Applications that validate HMAC-based XML digital signatures
might be vulnerable to this type of attack.
Note: This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an untrusted applet
or Java Web Start application.
CVE-2009-2671
CVE-2009-2672: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with
the SOCKS proxy implementation might allow an untrusted applet or
Java Web Start application to determine the user name of the user
running the applet or application.
A second vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with the
proxy mechanism implementation might allow an untrusted applet or
Java Web Start application to obtain browser cookies and leverage
those cookies to hijack sessions.
CVE-2009-2673: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with
the proxy mechanism implementation might allow an untrusted applet
or Java Web Start application to make non-authorized socket or URL
connections to hosts other than the origin host.
CVE-2009-2674: An integer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing JPEG images might allow an untrusted
Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example,
an untrusted application might grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or run local applications that are accessible to
the user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-2675: An integer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with unpacking applets and Java Web Start applications
using the unpack200 JAR unpacking utility might allow an untrusted
applet or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet might grant itself permissions to read and write local files
or run local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-2625: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) with parsing XML data might allow a remote client to create a
denial-of-service condition on the system that the JRE runs on.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of IBM Java after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# Sun JDK/JRE: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200911-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Sun JDK and JRE allow for several attacks,
including the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/sun-jre-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.0.17** |

| Package | **app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.0.17** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.5.0.22**>= **1.6.0.17** |

### Background

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the Sun Java
implementation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below and
the associated Sun Alerts for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted JAR
archive, applet, or Java Web Start application, possibly resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. Furthermore, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of
Service affecting multiple services via several vectors, disclose
information and memory contents, write or execute local files, conduct
session hijacking attacks via GIFAR files, steal cookies, bypass the
same-origin policy, load untrusted JAR files, establish network
connections to arbitrary hosts and posts via several vectors, modify
the list of supported graphics configurations, bypass HMAC-based
authentication systems, escalate privileges via several vectors and
cause applet code to be executed with older, possibly vulnerable
versions of the JRE.

NOTE: Some vulnerabilities require a trusted environment, user
interaction, a DNS Man-in-the-Middle or Cross-Site-Scripting attack.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Sun JRE 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JRE 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JDK 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JDK 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.6.0.17"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.5.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.5.0.22"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.6.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JRE 1.4.x, Sun JDK 1.4.x, Blackdown JRE, Blackdown JDK and
precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.4.x users are strongly advised to unmerge
Java 1.4:

```
 # emerge --unmerge =app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jdk-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jdk
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jre
```

Gentoo is ceasing support for the 1.4 generation of the Sun Java
Platform in accordance with upstream. All 1.4 JRE and JDK versions are
masked and will be removed shortly.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
