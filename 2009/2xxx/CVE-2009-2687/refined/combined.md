Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- php5
php5 has been updated to fix problems with SSL certificate
validation and overflows in the exif and gd modules
(CVE-2009-3291,CVE-2009-3292, CVE-2009-3293, CVE-2009-2687).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- newt
A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way newt used to process
content, to be rendered in text dialog box. Local attacker could issue
a specially-crafted text dialog box rendering request (direct or via
custom application), leading to denial of service (application crash)
or, potentially, to execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running the application (CVE-2009-2905).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- rubygem-actionpack
This update improves the escaping in the helper code of Ruby on
Rails to protect against XSS attacks (CVE-2009-3009) and an
information leak (CVE-2009-3086).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.1
- rubygem-activesupport
This update improves the escaping in the helper code of Ruby on
Rails to protect against XSS attacks (CVE-2009-3009) and an
information leak (CVE-2009-3086).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.1
- java-1\_4\_2-ibm
IBM Java 1.4.2 was updated to SR13 FP1.
It fixes following two security issues:
CVE-2009-2625: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with parsing XML data might allow a remote client to create a
denial-of-service condition on the system that the JRE runs on.
CVE-2008-5349: A vulnerability in how the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) handles certain RSA public keys might cause the JRE to consume
an excessive amount of CPU resources. This might lead to a Denial of
Service (DoS) condition on affected systems. Such keys could be
provided by a remote client of an application.
This issue affects the following security providers:
IBMJCE, IBMPKCS11Impl and IBMJCEFIPS.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11
- postgresql
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in PostgrSQL
- CVE-2009-3229: allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial
of service
- CVE-2009-3230: allows remote authenticated users to gain higher
privileges
- CVE-2009-3231: when using LDAP authentication with anonymous
binds, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an
empty password
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- samba
samba's make\_connection\_snum() handles certain input incorrectly,
which may lead to disclosure of the root directory (CVE-2009-2813).
Additionally an information disclosure vulnerability in mount.cifs
has been fixed (CVE-2009-2948) as well as a DoS condition
(CVE-2009-2906).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- phpMyAdmin
phpMyAdmin has been updated to version 2.11.9.6 to fix a cross-site
scripting (XSS) issue (CVE-2009-3696) and an SQL injection
vulnerability (CVE-2009-3697).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3, openSUSE 11.0
- viewvc
Update of viewvc to version 1.0.9 fixes a cross-site scripting (XSS)
problem and enhances filtering of illegal characters when displaying
error messages (CVE-2009-3618, CVE-2009-3619).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Package        : php5
Vulnerability  : multiple issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-2626 CVE-2009-2687 CVE-2009-3291 CVE-2009-3292
Debian bugs    : 535888 540605 527560

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the PHP 5
hypertext preprocessor. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

The following issues have been fixed in both the stable (lenny)
and the oldstable (etch) distributions:

CVE-2009-2687 CVE-2009-3292

    The exif module did not properly handle malformed jpeg files,
    allowing an attacker to cause a segfault, resulting in a denial
    of service.

CVE-2009-3291

    The php_openssl_apply_verification_policy() function did not
    properly perform certificate validation.

No CVE id yet

    Bogdan Calin discovered that a remote attacker could cause a denial
    of service by uploading a large number of files in using multipart/
    form-data requests, causing the creation of a large number of
    temporary files.

    To address this issue, the max_file_uploads option introduced in PHP
    5.3.1 has been backported. This option limits the maximum number of
    files uploaded per request. The default value for this new option is
    50. See NEWS.Debian for more information.

The following issue has been fixed in the stable (lenny) distribution:

CVE-2009-2626

     A flaw in the ini_restore() function could lead to a memory
     disclosure, possibly leading to the disclosure of sensitive data.

In the oldstable (etch) distribution, this update also fixes a regression
introduced by the fix for CVE-2008-5658 in DSA-1789-1 (bug #527560).

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny4.

The oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.0+dfsg-8+etch16.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed in version 5.2.11.dfsg.1-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.

I originally found this issue by fooling around with the "zzuf" fuzzer, and reported a very similar bug in the "jhead" exif utility at <http://bugs.debian.org/530401>  Original image can be found at: <http://www.noloop.net/bugs/php/001-exif/hello.jpeg> Corrupted image can be found at: <http://www.noloop.net/bugs/php/001-exif/hello-s148.jpeg>   Reproduce code: --------------- <?php  var_dump(exif_read_data($_SERVER['argv'][1], array("FILE", "COMPUTED", "ANY_TAG") ));  Expected result: ---------------- Dump of exif data if possible, or FALSE (since the jpeg file is indeed corrupt)  Actual result: -------------- Segmentation fault.  Quick GDB dump: (gdb) run Starting program: /home/frode/temp/z/z3/php5.2-200905241830/sapi/cli/php /home/frode/temp/z/s.php /home/frode/temp/z/a-s6.jpeg  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault. 0x0808bcd3 in exif_process_IFD_in_JPEG (ImageInfo=0xbfc893b8,      dir_start=0x92f76c0 <Address 0x92f76c0 out of bounds>, offset_base=0x8ef76b8 "II*", IFDlength=15055,      displacement=30, section_index=3) at /home/frode/temp/z/z3/php5.2-200905241830/ext/exif/exif.c:1088 1088                    return (((uchar *)value)[1] << 8) | ((uchar *)value)[0]; (gdb) up #1  0x0808e6ca in exif_read_file (ImageInfo=0xbfc893b8, FileName=<value optimized out>,      read_thumbnail=<value optimized out>, read_all=0)     at /home/frode/temp/z/z3/php5.2-200905241830/ext/exif/exif.c:3221 3221            exif_process_IFD_in_JPEG(ImageInfo, CharBuf+offset_of_ifd, CharBuf, length/*-14*/, displacement, SECTION_IFD0 TSRMLS_CC);   Note the "dir_start" address being out of bounds, which causes the "((uchar *)value)[1]" to segfault. (The function names are a bit confusing, maybe it's because of method inlining?)   ``` PatchesPull RequestsHistoryAllCommentsChangesGit/SVN commitsRelated reports  **[2009-05-25 19:59 UTC] [iliaa@php.net](//people.php.net/iliaa)** ``` I am getting the following error messages, but no crash:  Warning: exif_read_data(hello-s148.jpeg): Illegal IFD size: x40000B + 2  + x0000*12 = x40000B > x007E in exif.php on line 2  Warning: exif_read_data(hello-s148.jpeg): Error reading from file:  got=x08B4(=2228) != itemlen-2=x1FFE(=8190) in exif.php on line 2  Warning: exif_read_data(hello-s148.jpeg): Invalid JPEG file in exif.php  on line 2    ``` **[2009-05-25 20:49 UTC] phpbug dot exif at sub dot noloop dot net** ``` That's odd. I'm getting 100% reproducible crash on both the latest 5.2 cvs snapshot, as well as the php build included in Debian Linux 5.0.1 (stable) (which is 5.2.6+some debian patches)  I'm using Linux 2.6.29.4, Debian 5.0.1, gcc version 4.3.2 (Debian 4.3.2-1.1) on an i686 (32bit) machine with 3gb ram.   To compile, I did:  './configure'  '--prefix=/home/frode/temp/z/zinst3' '--disable-all' '--enable-exif' make cli  Are you running on 64bit, or perhaps some other distro with a different version of gcc etc?  ``` **[2009-05-26 05:24 UTC] [scottmac@php.net](//people.php.net/scottmac)** ``` I can confirm here on OSX.  #0  0x00033397 in php_ifd_get16u (value=0x7100b1, motorola_intel=0) at /Users/scott/dev/php5_2/ext/exif/exif.c:1088 1088			return (((uchar *)value)[1] << 8) | ((uchar *)value)[0]; (gdb) bt #0  0x00033397 in php_ifd_get16u (value=0x7100b1, motorola_intel=0) at /Users/scott/dev/php5_2/ext/exif/exif.c:1088 #1  0x00037a01 in exif_process_IFD_in_JPEG (ImageInfo=0xbfffef8c, dir_start=0x7100b1 <Address 0x7100b1 out of bounds>, offset_base=0x3100a8 "II*", IFDlength=126, displacement=12, section_index=3) at /Users/scott/dev/php5_2/ext/exif/exif.c:3140 #2  0x00037d92 in exif_process_TIFF_in_JPEG (ImageInfo=0xbfffef8c, CharBuf=0x3100a8 "II*", length=126, displacement=12) at /Users/scott/dev/php5_2/ext/exif/exif.c:3221 #3  0x00037e92 in exif_process_APP1 (ImageInfo=0xbfffef8c, CharBuf=0x3100a0 "", length=134, displacement=4) at /Users/scott/dev/php5_2/ext/exif/exif.c:3246 #4  0x000384d2 in exif_scan_JPEG_header (ImageInfo=0xbfffef8c) at /Users/scott/dev/php5_2/ext/exif/exif.c:3385 #5  0x000393c4 in exif_scan_FILE_header (ImageInfo=0xbfffef8c) at /Users/scott/dev/php5_2/ext/exif/exif.c:3757 #6  0x0003a073 in exif_read_file (ImageInfo=0xbfffef8c, FileName=0x30d2d4 "hello-s148.jpeg", read_thumbnail=0, read_all=0) at /Users/scott/dev/php5_2/ext/exif/exif.c:3902   ``` **[2009-05-27 19:05 UTC] [jani@php.net](//people.php.net/jani)** ``` Verified with proper test script, this function never accepted array  parameters:  <?php exif_read_data( "[http://www.noloop.net/bugs/php/001-exif/hello-s148.jpeg"](http://www.noloop.net/bugs/php/001-exif/hello-s148.jpeg%22),  "FILE,COMPUTED,ANY_TAG" );  Same backtrace (just a bit different line numbers) with all branches.  ``` **[2009-05-28 12:49 UTC] [iliaa@php.net](//people.php.net/iliaa)** ``` On 64 bit linux I get no crash and no complaints from valgrind either.  ``` **[2009-05-28 14:04 UTC] [pajoye@php.net](//people.php.net/pajoye)** ``` This bug has been fixed in CVS.
