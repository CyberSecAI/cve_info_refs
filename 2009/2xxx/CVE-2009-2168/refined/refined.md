  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the username and password parameters retrieved from cookies or POST requests before using them in an SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can manipulate the 'username' and 'password' parameters through either cookies or POST requests.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application."
