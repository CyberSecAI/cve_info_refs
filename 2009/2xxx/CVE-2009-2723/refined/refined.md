      "source": "www.vmware.com_dccc8370_20250125_130614.html",
      "root_cause": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) prior to version 1.5.0_20.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities existed in earlier versions of the JRE."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted JAR archive, applet, or Java Web Start application, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. Furthermore, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service affecting multiple services via several vectors, disclose information and memory contents, write or execute local files, conduct session hijacking attacks via GIFAR files, steal cookies, bypass the same-origin policy, load untrusted JAR files, establish network connections to arbitrary hosts and posts via several vectors, modify the list of supported graphics configurations, bypass HMAC-based authentication systems, escalate privileges via several vectors and cause applet code to be executed with older, possibly vulnerable versions of the JRE.",

        "Specially crafted JAR archive",
         "Applet",

      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to open the malicious file or applet.",
        "additional_notes": "The provided document is part of a security advisory (VMSA-2009-0016) that addresses multiple security issues in third-party components, including JRE. The specific CVE-2009-2723 is related to JRE updates in VMware products. The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely only if the attacker has access to the Service Console network. The update to JRE version 1.5.0_20 addresses this and other security issues."
