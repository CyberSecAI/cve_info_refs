Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2822:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in the improper propagation of MAC address Access Control Lists (ACLs) to network extenders in AirPort Base Station configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how AirPort devices distribute MAC address-based access restrictions. Specifically, the MAC address ACLs configured on the base station were not correctly passed to network extenders. This creates a bypass of the intended access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthorized user can potentially connect to a restricted network, which should have been blocked by the MAC address ACLs. This could allow unauthorized access to network resources and sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves connecting to a network extender within the scope of the vulnerable AirPort network setup. This attack is possible due to the network extender not receiving the correct ACL settings from the base station.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within range of the network extender and possess a device with a MAC address not included in the base station's ACL but that can connect to the extender. They do not need to be authenticated to the main network itself, only the network extender.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Guido Lamberty.
- Apple released "AirPort Base Station Update 2010-001" to address this issue by improving the distribution of settings to network extenders.
- The affected systems include Mac OS X v10.5.7 or later, Windows 7, Vista, and XP.
