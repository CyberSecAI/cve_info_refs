The described behavior is unique to i586 (it does not occur on x86_64 systems).  Furthermore the bug only occurs when running the sssd daemonized (with the -D option). It does not manifest when running in debug mode.  Further investigation is needed.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=514057#c2)  Stephen Gallagher    2009-07-28 13:50:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 355410](attachment.cgi?id=355410 "Patch to ensure proper return from password check") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=355410&action=edit "Patch to ensure proper return from password check") Patch to ensure proper return from password check  Ok, I've tracked down the issue here. In the LOCAL authentication check, we evaluate whether the LOCAL backend has a password set for the user. It looks like there was a copy-paste error that resulted in us returning early from the authentication evaluation with a success code instead of an error code. I have now corrected it so that we explicitly set the return code to LDB_ERR_NO_SUCH_ATTRIBUTE when the password is missing.  Could someone from the security response team please review the attached patch? It should apply cleanly against the SSSD 0.4.1 SRPM sources in CVS.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=514057#c3)  Stephen Gallagher    2009-07-28 15:04:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 355424](attachment.cgi?id=355424&action=diff "Patch to ensure proper return from password check") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=355424&action=edit "Patch to ensure proper return from password check")  Patch to ensure proper return from password check  Replacing old patch with new one that lists CVE in the commit message.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=514057#c4)  Stephen Gallagher    2009-07-29 11:54:47 UTC  ``` Built in Koji, submitted for stable.  <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=124518>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=514057#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-07-29 21:32:04 UTC  ``` sssd-0.4.1-3.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
