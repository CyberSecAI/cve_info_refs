- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, and it does not adequately protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - SQL Injection: Unsanitized input in the `news/index.php` file's `id` parameter allows for SQL injection attacks.
    - XSS: Unsanitized input in `enrolments/step1.php`, `files/shared_list.php` (both logged-in and not), using `courseid` and `search`/`siteid` parameters respectively, allows for XSS attacks.
    - CSRF: Lack of proper CSRF protection in `login/logout.php` and `enrolments/step2.php` can lead to unauthorized actions if the user is tricked into performing requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - SQL Injection: An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or even take control of the server by injecting malicious SQL commands.
    - XSS: An attacker could inject malicious scripts that could be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions within the user's browser.
     - CSRF: An attacker could trick a logged-in user to logout or add/remove courses from their cart without their knowledge.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - SQL Injection: Sending a crafted GET request to `news/index.php` with the `id` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
    - XSS: Sending crafted GET/POST requests to vulnerable files (`enrolments/step1.php`, `files/shared_list.php`) with malicious javascript injected into parameters like `courseid`, `search` or `siteid`.
    - CSRF: An attacker could use an image, a redirection or a link to force a user to logout. Also, an attacker may be able to perform unauthorized actions on the user's cart, knowing the parameters `action`, `orderid` and `courseid`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - SQL Injection: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
    - XSS: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET/POST requests to vulnerable endpoints.
     - CSRF: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious link/image/redirection that the user will interact with while being authenticated to the application.
