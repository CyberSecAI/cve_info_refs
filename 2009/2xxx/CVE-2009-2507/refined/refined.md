Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2009-2507:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the Indexing Service's ActiveX control, specifically how it processes URLs. The ActiveX component does not properly handle specially crafted web content, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption caused by improper handling of URLs by the ActiveX control.
*   **ActiveX Control Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is located in a specific ActiveX component of the Indexing Service (ixsso.dll).
*   **Improper URL Handling:** The control fails to properly process malicious URLs, allowing for the exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
*   **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
*   **Malicious Actions:**  Attackers could install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new user accounts with full privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker gains the same user rights as the user browsing the malicious web page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker can create a malicious web page that, when visited by a user, attempts to load and execute the vulnerable binary through the Indexing Service COM object. This web page contains a script to load the vulnerable component.
*  **Email Attachments:** The malicious content could be delivered via an email attachment, tricking the user into opening it.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject the malicious code into compromised or user-content accepting websites.
*   **Drive-by Downloads:** If the user visits a website hosting the malicious content and the vulnerable Indexing Service is installed on their system, it is possible to execute code without requiring any further user interaction than visiting the site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing prior authentication.
*   **Web Hosting:** The attacker needs a way to host a malicious web page or inject malicious content into an existing website.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker must convince a user to either visit the malicious webpage or open the malicious attachment.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Indexing Service is a non-default component that must be manually installed by the administrator to be vulnerable.
*  The vulnerability can be exploited even if the Indexing Service is not actively running, as long as it has been installed.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way that the Indexing Service ActiveX control processes URLs.

**Mitigation and Workarounds:**

*   **Apply the official Microsoft update:** The primary solution is to apply the security update provided by Microsoft (MS09-057).
*   **Unregister ixsso.dll:** Unregistering the ixsso.dll will disable the Indexing Service ActiveX control
*    **Set the kill bit for the ActiveX control:** This prevents the Indexing Service ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer
*   **Increase Security Zones to "High" in Internet Explorer:** Prompting before running ActiveX controls and active scripting can reduce the risk.
*  **Disable Active Scripting:** Disable active scripting in Internet Explorer settings or setting it to prompt before running scripts
*  **Add Trusted Sites:** Adding trusted sites to Internet Explorer's trusted sites list can reduce prompts
