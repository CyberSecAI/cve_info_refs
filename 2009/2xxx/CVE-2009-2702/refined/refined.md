{
  "CVE-2009-2702": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of the NUL character ('\\0') within the Subject Alternative Name (subjectAltName) field of X.509 certificates by kdelibs' KSSL library.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The KSSL library in kdelibs fails to properly verify SSL certificates when a NUL character is embedded in the domain name within the subjectAltName field. This allows an attacker to create a malicious certificate that bypasses hostname verification.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to spoof arbitrary SSL servers. By presenting a crafted certificate with a NUL character in the subjectAltName, the attacker can intercept and potentially manipulate communications between the client and the legitimate server.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted X.509 certificate presented by a malicious server during an SSL/TLS handshake. The crafted certificate must be issued by a legitimate Certification Authority but contain a NUL character in the subjectAltName field to bypass verification.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between a client and a server, and be able to present a crafted certificate during the SSL/TLS handshake. The attacker must also obtain a certificate from a legitimate certificate authority."
