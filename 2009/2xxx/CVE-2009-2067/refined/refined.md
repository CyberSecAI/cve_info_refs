The provided content discusses a research paper titled "Pretty-Bad-Proxy: An Overlooked Adversary in Browsersâ€™ HTTPS Deployments". This paper is related to the security of HTTPS implementations in web browsers, which aligns with the scope of a CVE that would describe a vulnerability related to secure communications.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The paper highlights a class of vulnerabilities stemming from how browsers integrate HTTPS, specifically focusing on an adversary dubbed "Pretty-Bad-Proxy" (PBP). The core issue is that browsers' rendering modules are vulnerable when processing HTTPS content, even though the cryptographic aspects of HTTPS remain intact. The paper argues that browser design neglects these kinds of adversaries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-  The research identifies that a malicious proxy (PBP) can exploit vulnerabilities in the browser's rendering modules, operating *above* the HTTP/HTTPS layer.
- Specifically the vulnerabilities allow the attacker to:
    - **Steal sensitive data** from an HTTPS server.
    - **Fake an HTTPS page.**
    - **Impersonate an authenticated user** to access an HTTPS server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- The exploitation allows an attacker to bypass end-to-end security guarantees of HTTPS.
- Sensitive information can be stolen, users can be tricked with fake HTTPS pages, and attackers can gain unauthorized access to servers by impersonating valid users.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack is performed by a malicious proxy (PBP) that intercepts and manipulates traffic. The attacker must be in a position where they can sniff the browser's traffic, meaning the attacker is likely on the same network or able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs the capability to operate a malicious proxy that can intercept and manipulate HTTP/HTTPS traffic. This suggests the attacker must have some control over the network the victim is using, or have compromised network infrastructure. They don't necessarily need to break any cryptographic protocol to achieve the attack.
