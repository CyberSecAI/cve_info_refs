Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2009-2739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in FreeNAS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is specifically a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. This means that the application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the user's web browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a network connection. An attacker can inject the malicious script through various means, potentially including crafted URLs or form inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be remote (i.e., over the internet) and does not need prior authentication.
- The attack requires convincing the user to click a link or view a malicious file. The user interaction required is considered 'simple' as it involves actions that are generally not perceived as harmful.
- The exploit complexity is low, requiring little expertise to exploit the XSS.
