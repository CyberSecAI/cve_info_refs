  "cve": "CVE-2009-2463",
  "description": "Integer overflow in a base64 decoding function in Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.12 and Thunderbird allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.",
  "affected_versions": {
    "firefox": "< 3.0.12",
      "thunderbird": "< unspecified"
  },
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "An integer overflow exists in the base64 decoding function. Specifically the calculation of the destination buffer size could overflow, resulting in insufficient memory allocation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Memory Corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash) or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted base64 encoded string to vulnerable applications. The exact mechanism to trigger is not specified but the attack occurs during the base64 decode process itself.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to cause the vulnerable application to attempt to decode a specifically crafted base64 string."
  },
  "patch_details": {
      "fix": "The vulnerability was addressed by implementing checks to prevent integer overflows when calculating buffer sizes during base64 decoding. The fix also included an abort() call when an overflow is detected, preventing further execution in the presence of a potentially malformed size calculation.",
