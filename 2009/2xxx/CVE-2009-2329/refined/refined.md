    {
      "cve": "CVE-2009-2329",
      "vulnerability": "Blind SQL Injection",
      "description": "The application is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection via the 'user_enter' cookie. Specifically, when 'user_enter' is set to 'auto', the application directly uses the values of the 'enter_login' and 'enter_parol' cookies in an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.",
       "root_cause": "Insufficient input sanitization of cookie values used in a SQL query.",
        "weakness": "SQL Injection",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application, potentially as an administrator. The provided exploit demonstrates how to log in as an admin without knowing the credentials.",
       "attack_vector": "HTTP Cookie manipulation.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to set and modify HTTP cookies. No special position is needed."

        "root_cause":"Insufficient input sanitization of GET parameter value used in a SQL query.",
        "weakness": "SQL Injection",

By injecting JavaScript code into the 'v_variant1' POST parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser when that data is displayed to users.",
