How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Movable Type 4.26 Release Notes

> This version of Movable Type was released June 10, 2009.

Below are the highlighted fixes from Movable Type 4.26

* The method for parsing the categories within an mt:Entries tag has been fixed to allow categories with whitespace in the name and a logical operator, such as AND, OR, or NOT
* Fixes to a bug where the comment response did not return users to the entry
* Eliminated non-scaling queries from CMS: in-CMS search, clearing of expired sessions, system-wide commenter counts
* Low-level changes that should improve performance across the board: metadata saving, unnecessary reloading of config under FastCGI
* Fixes to the Backup/Restore functionality
* Database index changes to improve query speed
* Patches issue with blog search not searching all blogs if IncludeBlogs, ExcludeBlogs, and blog\_id parameters are omitted
* Adds new, optional config directives for greater control over RPT when processing large queues or long-running jobs
* Security fix for mt-wizard.cgi

The full svn changelog can be found at the following address: <http://icanhaz.com/426changelog>
