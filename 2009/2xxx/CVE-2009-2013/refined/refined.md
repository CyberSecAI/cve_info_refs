Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-2013

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw present in the `source_class` parameter of the `aps_browse_sources.php` script in Frontis version 3.9.01.24.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `source_class` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database Exposure: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive information from the database (e.g., user names, passwords, email addresses), or modify/delete existing data. The exploit code specifically targets retrieval of `user_name`, `user_pass`, and `user_email` from the `login_table`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `aps_browse_sources.php` script, including a crafted SQL injection payload within the `source_class` parameter.
- Publicly Accessible Script: The `aps_browse_sources.php` script, located at `/bin/aps_browse_sources.php`, appears to be accessible to the public.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web server hosting the Frontis application.
- Basic Web Knowledge: The attacker should possess knowledge of SQL injection techniques and the basic structure of HTTP requests.
- No authentication required for the vulnerable page.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit-db entry provides a working proof-of-concept URL that demonstrates the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable version is Frontis V3.9.01.24
