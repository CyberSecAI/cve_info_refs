  "CVE-2009-2419": {
    "description": "The provided data indicates that CVE-2009-2419 is related to a vulnerability in WebCore's loader component where Loader::Host objects were being manually managed (using new/delete) and could be deleted while a resource load delegate callback was still in progress. The fix involves making Loader::Host RefCounted and adding protectors to the callbacks.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Manual memory management of Loader::Host objects leading to use-after-free conditions when a Host object is deleted while still being used in a resource load delegate callback.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free",
        "Incorrect object lifecycle management"
      ],
      "impact": "A crash in WebCore::Loader::Host::servePendingRequests() or similar functions can occur if the Host object is deleted while it is in the middle of a resource load delegate callback, potentially leading to denial of service or unexpected behavior.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Web page loading",
         "Manipulating resource loading behavior via JavaScript to trigger specific callback sequences."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to load a web page with specific resource loading characteristics",
         "Trigger a resource load that deletes the host before the callback is finished."
      ],
        "additional_information": "The fix involves changing Loader::Host to be RefCounted and adding protectors (RefPtr) in the callbacks to ensure the Host object is not deleted prematurely. A test case was added `http/tests/loading/deleted-host-in-resource-load-delegate-callback.html` to reproduce and verify the fix. Additionally, an earlier attempt to fix this `ProcessingResource` was removed."
