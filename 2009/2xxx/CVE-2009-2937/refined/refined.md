Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-2937:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-submitted feed content within the Planet and Planet Venus feed aggregator software. Specifically, the software fails to properly sanitize the `src` attribute of `<img>` elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Malicious code, in the form of JavaScript, can be injected through the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to inject and execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML code within the context of a user's browser when they view the aggregated feed.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Feed Content:** An attacker can introduce malicious HTML (specifically an `<img>` tag with a `javascript:` URI in the `src` attribute) into a feed that is consumed by Planet/Planet Venus.
*   **Feed Aggregation:** When Planet/Planet Venus processes this feed, the malicious code is not properly sanitized and is included in the generated output.
*   **User Access:** When a user accesses the output generated by Planet/Planet Venus, the malicious code is executed by their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Submit Feeds:** An attacker needs the capability to submit or influence the content of a feed that is processed by Planet or Planet Venus. This could be a feed they control or a compromised feed.
*   **No Direct Server Access:** The attacker does not require direct access to the Planet/Planet Venus server. The attack is performed via the content of the feed.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Specific Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerability exists in the sanitization logic of the `planet/sanitize.py` file for Planet, and in the sanitization within `scrub.py` for planet-venus where it didn't properly strip the javascript URI.
*   **Patch:** The fix involves stripping the javascript code from the src and href attributes.
*   **Case Insensitivity:** The patch initially needed to be updated to be case-insensitive to catch all variations of "javascript:".
*   **CDATA Handling:** Further discussion arose regarding issues with how CDATA sections were handled, indicating that the original patch was not fully comprehensive.
*   **Multiple Instances:** Both `planet` and `planet-venus` were found vulnerable, requiring separate patches.
*   **Debian:** Debian Bug Reports #546178 (planet) and #546179 (planet-venus) track the issues and fixes in Debian.
