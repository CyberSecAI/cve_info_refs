How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Venus Updates

---

2009-09-09T15:23:52Z

I’ve [updated](http://intertwingly.net/code/venus/index.atom) planet [Venus](http://www.intertwingly.net/code/venus/).  Summary of the changes:

* Updated to the latest [httplib2](http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/).
* Updated to the latest [html5lib](http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/).
* Replaced calls to [feedparser’s sanitizer](http://www.feedparser.org/docs/html-sanitization.html) with [html5lib’s sanitizer](http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Sanitization_rules).
* Eliminated [md5](http://docs.python.org/library/md5.html) deprecation warning when running with Python 2.6.

While I’m dog-fooding this myself, it might be wise to wait a few days to see what bugs shake out before upgrading.  When the bugs are shaken out the result should be more secure (example: HTML5lib will sanitize URI schemes), and should also fix [Mozilla bug 514534](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=514534) without the need to resort to the `application/xhtml+xml` mime type, which causes [other problems](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=514653).

Bug reports should go to the [mailing list](http://lists.planetplanet.org/mailman/listinfo/devel).

Style     # attributes are parsed, and a restricted set, # specified by     # ALLOWED_CSS_PROPERTIES and ALLOWED_CSS_KEYWORDS, are allowed through.     # attributes in ATTR_VAL_IS_URI are scanned, and only URI schemes specified     # in ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS are allowed.     #     #   sanitize_html('<script> do_nasty_stuff() </script>')     #    => &lt;script> do_nasty_stuff() &lt;/script>     #   sanitize_html('<a href="javascript: sucker();">Click here for $100</a>')     #    => <a>Click here for $100</a>   So is this a bug against the planet pkg or filed against fedora infrastructure's planet instance?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=522802#c4)  seth vidal    2009-09-11 16:39:28 UTC  ``` I see where venus has the ability to pass it through the better filter but appears to not be doing that.

*** Please type your report below this line ***

The planet feed aggregator attempts to remove malicious content from
user-submitted feeds.  It does a great job, but fails to sanitize

  <img src="javascript:alert(1);" >

At least Opera will execute this code.

The package in Lenny is vulnerable and should require a
security update.  Fixed packages are available from:

 <http://www.steve.org.uk/tmp/planet/lenny/>

This is the patch I used, written by upstream:

Justification: user security hole
Severity: grave

*** Please type your report below this line ***

The planet feed aggregator attempts to remove malicious content from
user-submitted feeds.  It does a great job, but fails to sanitize
this input:

  <img src="javascript:alert(1);" >

At least Opera will execute this code.

The packages in Etch and Lenny are vulnerable and should require a
security update.  Fixed packages are available from:

Hi,

I have prepared  yesterday a package for Lenny  including this patch. At
the moment, I'm waiting for a reply from the debian-security team.

Concerning  unstable and  testing fixes,  I plan  to remove  planet from
unstable ASAP because there has not  been any new upstream release for 3
years  now.  I  have already  contacted  the ftpmaster  and Noah  Slater
(maintainer of planet-venus which replaces planet).

Thank you very much for the patch and bug report.

Regards,
Arnaud Fontaine

  Did you see the followup discussion from Secunia about another
 planet-problem, relating to the handling of CDATA ?

  (To be honest if I were to re-do the patch now I'd probably
 do it the other way round : Make sure "src"starts with http:
 to cover other cases too.)

No I didn't, I could not find this discussion, could you please point it
me out?   As soon as all these  issues will have been  addressed, I will
prepare  a  package (debian-security  team:  please  do  not upload  the
package for now).

As  the debian-security  team has  not replied  yet, maybe  it  is still
possible to update the patch?

 Basically it comes down to CDATA and the handling of <description>

 This is the comment I received:

--
 please find attached the two reproducers for the CDATA thing. poc1.xml
 is not correctly filtered while poc2.xml is filtered, although they are
 nearly identical.

 If you edit the newly patched function to print the k and v values,
 you'll see that the attributes aren't passed through.

Please update this through -proposed-updates, we're
currently swamped with more severe issues.

Unfortunately, I  don't have so  much time at  the moment to be  able to
provide a new patch.  Would you have time to do it?  If you really can't
make it, I will try to do it anyway.

BTW, planet  has now been removed  from unstable, so this  is only about
fixing the oldstable and stable packages.

Thank you very much for your help fixing this bug.

Cheers,
Arnaud

I have not uploaded it yet  because, as mentioned in the bug report, the
patch doesn't fix all the cases. I  don't have time to look at it, but I
can upload the package if another patch is proposed.

Hi all,

this bug report already has a proposed patch by Steve Kemp (15/09/2009).
Can this be fixed in a security update for the people running (old)stable?

As explained before, the patch proposed does not completely fix the
problem and unfortunately I haven't had time yet to look at it. As planet
is not available anymore in testing/unstable because it has been
deprecated in favor of planet-venus, I would recommend switching to
planet-venus.
