{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application has insufficient input sanitization which allows for Local File Inclusion and SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files via LFI, and potentially gain access to user data via SQL injection.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET request with a manipulated 'newlang' parameter",
    "HTTP GET request with a manipulated 'opcao' and 'CodigoDisciplina' parameter"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."
