The provided content discusses a research paper titled "Pretty-Bad-Proxy: An Overlooked Adversary in Browsersâ€™ HTTPS Deployments". This paper is relevant to the CVE as it describes vulnerabilities related to how browsers handle HTTPS traffic and rendering, which can be exploited by a malicious proxy.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the neglect in the design of modern browsers, specifically in how they handle the rendering of content received over HTTPS, making them susceptible to attacks by a malicious proxy (Pretty-Bad-Proxy or PBP).
*   The core issue lies in the browser's trust of the content it receives after the HTTPS connection is established, neglecting that a malicious proxy could alter the content before it's rendered, even though the underlying cryptographic protection of HTTPS remains unbroken.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Browsers' rendering modules are vulnerable to manipulation by a PBP, operating above the HTTP/HTTPS layer.
*   These vulnerabilities allow a malicious proxy to compromise the end-to-end security guarantees provided by HTTPS.
*   Specific vulnerabilities include:
    *   Stealing sensitive data from an HTTPS server.
    *   Faking an HTTPS page to mislead users.
    *   Impersonating an authenticated user to access an HTTPS server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive information transmitted over HTTPS.
*   **Phishing/Spoofing:** Attackers can fake HTTPS pages, potentially leading to credential theft or other malicious activities.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can impersonate authenticated users to gain unauthorized access to HTTPS servers and resources.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A malicious proxy positioned between the user's browser and the HTTPS server. This proxy doesn't break the cryptographic part of HTTPS; instead, it manipulates the data after decryption and before rendering in the browser.
*   The paper notes that these vulnerabilities are exploitable in "many realistic network environments where attackers can sniff the browser traffic"
*  The attack occurs by manipulating the browser's rendering process, which happens after the secure HTTPS connection has been established.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to control or have access to a network proxy through which the victim's browser traffic passes.
*   The attacker doesn't need to break the cryptographic protocols of HTTPS.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept, modify, and forward the traffic between the user's browser and the web server.
* The attacker needs to have control over the proxy to inject malicious code.

The paper highlights that all major browsers and a large number of websites were affected by these vulnerabilities and that browser vendors have confirmed these vulnerabilities and are in the process of patching them.
