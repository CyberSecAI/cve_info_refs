How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## About

### Zoph (Zoph Organizes Photos) is a web based digital image presentation and management system. In other words, a photo album.

#### No cloud needed

Zoph is built with PHP and MySQL. You can run it on your own webserver or you can use third-party webhosting. The important part is that **you** are in control. No cloud needed.

#### Organize your photos

Many people store their photos in the digital equivalent of a shoe box: lots of directories with names like 'Holiday 2008', 'January 2005' or even 'Photos034'. Like shoe boxes, this is a great way to put your photos away, but not such a great way to find them back or even look at them. Zoph can help you to store your photos and keep them organized.

#### *All* of your photos

While most photo album projects are primarily targeted at showing your photos to others, Zoph is primarily targeted at keeping your photos organized for yourself, giving you granular control over what you'd like to show to others, on a per-album or even a per-photo basis.

#### Zoph is open source

Zoph is open source, free software, licensed under the [GNU GPL v2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html). Development is done using Git, via the [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com) site.

If you want to help with the development of Zoph, you are invited to fork the [GitLab project](http://gitlab.com/zoph-project/zoph). Even if you're not *fluent* in PHP, you can probably help!
