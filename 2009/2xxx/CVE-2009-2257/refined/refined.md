      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-2257",
      "is_related": true,
      "root_cause": "The Netgear DG632 router's web interface, which uses a script called `webcm` for authentication, can be bypassed to access files directly.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Authentication bypass",
        "Direct access to files without authentication"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can access sensitive files and data on the router without needing to authenticate, which can lead to information disclosure.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Directly accessing files by their path, bypassing the `webcm` script.",
        "Specifying path traversal sequences in the `nextpage` parameter of `webcm` to enumerate files and directories."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. No authentication is required for the bypass."
