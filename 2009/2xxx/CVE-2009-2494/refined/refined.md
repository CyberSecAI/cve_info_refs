  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A type mismatch vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL). The ATL header allows reading a variant from a stream and leaving the variant type with an invalid variant. When deleting the variant, it is possible to free unintended areas in memory that could be controlled by an attacker.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of data streams in ATL",
       "Type mismatch leading to memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the local user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "Web-based attacks: An attacker could host a malicious website containing a specially crafted ActiveX control designed to exploit the vulnerability, and convince users to visit it. This includes compromised websites or those that host user-provided content/ads.",
       "Email/IM links: Attackers could trick users into clicking links in emails or instant messages that redirect to the malicious site."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage with a malicious ActiveX control and convince the user to visit the site. Requires knowledge of ATL vulnerabilities and memory corruption techniques.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability stems from a bug in a private ATL header file used in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, not the public ATL version distributed with Visual Studio. The vulnerability is caused by a bug in the ATL header that could allow reading a variant from a stream and leaving the variant type read with an invalid variant. When deleting the variant, it would be possible to free unintended areas in memory that could be controlled by an attacker, resulting in inconsistent memory contents and execution of malicious code. The vulnerability affects ActiveX controls built with the vulnerable ATL methods which may not correctly validate information.",
