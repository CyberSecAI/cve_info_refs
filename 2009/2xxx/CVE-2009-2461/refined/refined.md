Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The primary root cause lies in the lack of proper input validation and the use of unsafe functions in both `mimetex` and `mathtex` applications. Specifically:
    *   `mimetex`:  Uses `strcpy` without bounds checking, leading to buffer overflows. Additionally, certain directives (\environ, \input, \counter) are not properly sanitized before execution.
    *   `mathtex`:  Passes unsanitized HTTP query string input to subprocesses, enabling command injection. It also suffers from stack-based buffer overflows and insecure temporary file handling.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stack-based Buffer Overflows:** Both `mimetex` and `mathtex` suffer from multiple stack-based buffer overflows, primarily due to the use of `strcpy` without checking the length of the input. Specifically, a vulnerable `strcpy` in `rastpicture()` function of `mimetex` is identified. There are also overflows in `mathtex` related to string operations.
    *   **Command Injection:**  `mathtex` is vulnerable to command injection because it uses unsanitized input from HTTP query strings as command arguments. The `getdirective()` function extracts input and uses it in `strreplace()` and `strcat()` operations that compose a shell command, without sanitizing the input.
    *   **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** `mathtex` uses deterministic file paths and the `fopen()` function without `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` flags, making it susceptible to file-related attacks.
    *   **Unsafe Directives:** In `mimetex`, the `\environ`, `\input`, and `\counter` directives are not suitable for exposure to commands from the internet, implying a potential for abuse if not properly sanitized.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow remote attackers to achieve:
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Through buffer overflows and command injection, attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable software.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Buffer overflows could lead to application crashes, causing a denial of service.
    *   **Other attacks:** Insecure temp file handling can allow for other types of attacks, though these aren't specified.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can send crafted HTTP requests containing oversized TeX expressions or malicious input in the query string. This input is processed by the vulnerable applications, triggering the described vulnerabilities.
    *   **Specifically crafted TeX expressions:** A crafted TeX expression such as the one provided, which includes excessive 'A' characters, can overflow the `pream` buffer in `mimetex`. In mathtex, the `\density` or `\dpi` directives within the query string can inject arbitrary commands if not sanitized.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable `mimetex` or `mathtex` CGI scripts.
    *   **Knowledge of vulnerabilities:** Attackers need to have knowledge of the specific vulnerabilities and how to trigger them through crafted inputs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `oCERT` advisory mentions that the initial fixes provided by the maintainer were incomplete, and further vulnerabilities were found in the updated packages before a complete fix was made available.
*   The discussion thread reveals the maintainer's initial reaction to the vulnerability report, which was later followed by cooperation.
*   The advisory highlights the difficulty in assigning affected versions due to the maintainer's versioning approach.

**In summary, the vulnerabilities are located in the mimetex and mathtex applications and are caused by a combination of unsafe coding practices, especially around handling untrusted inputs.** Attackers can leverage these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests, leading to remote code execution or denial of service.
