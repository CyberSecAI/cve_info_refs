    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an unchecked buffer in the TIFF processing by GDI+.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ allocates memory.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow remote code execution. An attacker could take complete control of an affected system. The attacker could then install programs, view/change/delete data or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a specially crafted TIFF file.  Attack vectors include a web-based attack scenario, a email attack scenario, or by hosting a malicious image on a network share and then convincing a user to browse to the folder in Windows Explorer.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted TIFF file.  In a web-based scenario, an attacker would need to host a web site with a crafted TIFF file.  In an e-mail scenario, the attacker must convince a user to open a crafted email or office document with a specially crafted TIFF file. In a file share attack, the attacker would have to convince the user to browse to a network share where the crafted file is located."
