- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Mahara did not properly apply permission checks when saving a view, even though it did check permissions before listing available artifacts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to insufficient permission checks during the saving of view.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to other users' artifacts that the attacker should not have access to.
- **Attack vectors:**  A user creates a 'view' and includes artifacts they don't have explicit access to.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to create and save 'views' within Mahara.
