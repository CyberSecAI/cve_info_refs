Vulnerability: Blind SQL Injection

Root cause: The Open Biller 0.1 application is vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection via the 'username' POST parameter in the login form. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

Attack Vector: By crafting a malicious POST request to the login page (index.php) with a specially crafted 'username' parameter, an attacker can inject SQL code that will be executed by the database. The vulnerability is blind, meaning the attacker cannot directly see the output of the injected SQL queries. Instead, the attacker must infer the results by observing the application's behavior (e.g., whether the login is successful or not).

Impact: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and password hashes. In this specific exploit, the attacker is able to retrieve the admin username and password hash from the 'users' table.

Weakness: Input validation failure.

Required attacker capabilities: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. Magic quotes need to be turned off.
