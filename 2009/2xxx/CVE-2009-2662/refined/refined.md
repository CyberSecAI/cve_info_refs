Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2662:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
The provided content includes a bug report in Bugzilla with the alias `CVE-2009-2662`. The summary of the bug is "TM: Crash [@ memcpy]", indicating a memory-related issue within the JavaScript engine's TraceMonkey component, and the crash occurs within the `memcpy` function. This aligns with the description of CVE-2009-2662.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an improper memory allocation within the TraceRecorder::snapshot function of the JavaScript engine.  Specifically, `alloca` was used to allocate memory on the stack, which could lead to stack overflow crashes when large amounts of memory were needed.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Stack Overflow:** The primary weakness is the use of `alloca` for memory allocation which is vulnerable to stack overflows.  The stack size is limited, and if the required allocation size becomes too large, it can overwrite the stack, leading to a crash.
    - **Memory Corruption**: The stack overflow causes a crash in memcpy, where data is written outside the allocated buffer which could potentially lead to memory corruption.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Crash:** The most immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the application using the vulnerable JavaScript engine. The crash occurs within the `memcpy` function.
   - **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The bug report explicitly mentions that the crash is exploitable with a "User Mode Write AV starting at MSVCR80D!memcpy". User mode write access violations that are not near NULL are exploitable, meaning that the stack overflow vulnerability has the potential to be leveraged to overwrite critical data on the stack and execute arbitrary code.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker can craft a malicious web page with JavaScript code that triggers the vulnerable code path, leading to a crash or potentially to arbitrary code execution. The provided bug report notes that several websites trigger this issue, providing practical attack vectors.
   - **JavaScript Execution:** The vulnerability is triggered when the JavaScript engine is executing JavaScript code that involves tracing and recording, and requires a large temporary buffer.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Web Server:** The attacker needs to host the malicious web page on a web server.
    - **Victim interaction**: The attacker needs the victim to visit the malicious web page using a browser with the vulnerable javascript engine.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report highlights the difficulty of reproducing the crash consistently, as it's dependent on the content and data processing within the JavaScript engine.
*   The vulnerability exists in versions of Firefox prior to 3.5.2 and has been fixed by replacing `alloca` with allocation from the cx->tempPool.
*   The bug report mentions duplicate issues, indicating the widespread nature of the problem.
*   The fix included in the bug report provides a patch which allocates the required memory from the `cx->tempPool` rather than on the stack.
*   The bug report also points to a possible stack overrun which could be used for arbitrary code execution.
*   A reduced testcase was found which makes the bug reliably reproducible.
