  Available for: Mac OS X v10.6 through v10.6.2, Mac OS X Server v10.6 through v10.6.2

  Impact: A network user may be able to bypass system login restrictions

  Description: An implementation issue exists in the handling of system login restrictions for network accounts. If the network accounts allowed to log in to the system at the Login Window are identified by group membership only, the restriction will not be enforced, and all network users will be allowed to log in to the system. The issue is addressed through improved group restriction management in the Accounts preference pane. This issue only affects systems configured to use a network account server, and does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.6. Credit to Christopher D. Grieb of University of Michigan MSIS for reporting this issue.

# [Security hole found in Rails 2.3’s http\_authentication.rb](https://n8.tumblr.com/post/117477059/security-hole-found-in-rails-23s)

- A hole that I believe could be a MAJOR deal for anyone using digest authentication in Rails 2.3 with the new http\_authentication.rb code and who followed the simple Digest example from the rdoc, or the blog entry introducing it.

  [http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/½/this-week-in-edge-rails](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2009/1/2/this-week-in-edge-rails%C2%A0)

  The hole would allow anyone to get to a protected page simply by sending a nil username/password with the request or an “incorrect” username and no password.

  In other words, whatever you were trying to protect using this is completely exposed.

  If you are effected, you should immediately patch (patch included below) your Rails 2.3 installation or change your password procedure.

  To provide a concrete example:

  <http://authbroken.heroku.com/>

  Don’t even type a username and password.  Just hit enter.  You shouldn’t have gotten to that protected page, but you did.

  ————–

  This is based on the example from the rails blog,

  (which is based on a password\_procedure also found in the rdoc and tests for this):

  class PostsController < ApplicationController

  Users = {“dhh” => “secret”}

  before\_filter :authenticate

  def index

  render :text => “You needed a password to see this…"

  end

  private

  def authenticate

  realm = "Application"

  authenticate\_or\_request\_with\_http\_digest(realm) do |name|

  Users[name]

  end

  end

  end

  ————–

  Another concrete example is the test case I’ve included in the patch:

  test "authentication request with nil credentials” do

  @request.env[‘HTTP\_AUTHORIZATION’] = encode\_credentials(:username => nil, :password => nil)

  get :index

  assert\_response :unauthorized

  assert\_equal “HTTP Digest: Access denied.\n”, @response.body, “Authentication didn’t fail for request”

  assert\_not\_equal 'Hello Secret’, @response.body, “Authentication didn’t fail for request”

  end

  This test does not pass against Rails 2.3.2. The response is a 200, which means Rails 2.3 lets a user with a nil username and password to access the protected :index action.

  —————

  The problem stems from the example in the documentation:

  #       def authenticate

  #         authenticate\_or\_request\_with\_http\_digest(REALM) do |username|

  #           USERS[username]

  #         end

  #       end

  If a request comes in with a nil username (for example from http\_digest\_authentication\_test.rb: @request.env['HTTP\_AUTHORIZATION’] = encode\_credentials(:username => nil, :password => nil))

  USERS[nil] is going to return nil.

  The documentation after this example in the rdoc, states: “Returning +nil+ will cause authentication to fail.”  But that isn’t what happens.  Nil is returned from the password procedure (USERS[nil]) and then proceeds to match the nil password that was sent in with the request.  So the validate method succeeds even though no user was actually matched against.

  ————————

  This patch also contains the fix I believe I recommend based on the behavior the documentation stated would happen.  In other words, since the documentation states that the password validation should fail if the password procedure returns nil, I’ve changed the validate\_digest\_response to return false if the password\_procedure returns nil.

  <https://gist.github.com/d5fa1ce8be9dfe0d9d19>

  For the record, I’ve attempted to contact the Ruby on Rails security list as well as a couple members on the core team, but no action has yet been taken to resolve the issue.  I felt this was big enough deal that people should be alerted without further delay.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
