Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-2927

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `nFileId` parameter of the `DetailFile.php` script, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly uses the user-supplied input (`nFileId` parameter) in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Exposure: Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
- Data Modification/Deletion: An attacker could also modify or delete data within the database.
- System Takeover: In some cases, SQL injection vulnerabilities can be leveraged to execute operating system commands, leading to a full system takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack vector is an HTTP GET request targeting the `DetailFile.php` script with a crafted `nFileId` parameter containing SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web application.
- Knowledge of SQL Injection: The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax and injection techniques.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `admin_user_info` table, specifically `UserPass` and `UserName`.
- The attacker can inject SQL by manipulating the `nFileId` parameter, for example, by using `nFileId=-40+union+select+1,2,3,group_concat%28UserPass,0x3a,UserName%29,5,6+from+admin_user_info--`.

This exploit targets the `DS CMS 1.0` application and its `DetailFile.php` script, which is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `nFileId` parameter.
