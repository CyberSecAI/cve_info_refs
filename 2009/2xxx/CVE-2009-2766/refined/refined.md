Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors in DD-WRT's httpd server (web server):
    - **Lack of Metacharacter Handling:** The httpd.c code does not sanitize or properly handle metacharacters within the file variable when processing requests, allowing for command injection.
    - **Unauthenticated Command Execution:** The server executes the command specified in the crafted URL even before successful authentication. While output isn't visible without auth, the command executes anyway.
    - **Root Privileges:** The httpd server runs as root, meaning that injected commands are executed with root privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection via the `file` parameter within a crafted URL.
- **Unauthenticated Execution:** The code executes commands before checking user authentication.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize user-supplied input before passing it to the shell.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Root Access:** An attacker can achieve remote root access on the device.
- **Full System Compromise:** With root access, an attacker can completely control the router. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Network traffic interception
    - DNS manipulation
    - Botnet inclusion
    - Further attacks on connected devices
- **CSRF Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited via CSRF, potentially allowing for device compromise without any user interaction (other than visiting a malicious site).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP request to the router's web interface.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a URL containing the command to execute within the "file" path, specifically using the cgi-bin path. Example: `/cgi-bin/;command_to_execute`
- **CSRF:** The vulnerability can be exploited via Cross-Site Request Forgery, using a crafted link (like an image tag) on a forum or web page that forces a victim's browser to make the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface, either directly (if remote access is enabled) or indirectly (through CSRF).
- **No Authentication Required:**  The vulnerability is exploitable even without an authenticated session on the router.
- **Understanding of Shell Syntax:** The attacker must be able to craft shell commands to achieve their goals, using shell variables to overcome limitations imposed by the lack of whitespace handling.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit leverages the fact that the `httpd` process runs as root, and the server writes the user supplied input into a temporary executable file, then proceeds to execute it as root.
- The exploit can also bypass authentication, because the command execution happens before the auth check.
- The exploit can be triggered remotely using a CSRF attack.
- The lack of whitespace handling could be worked around by replacing whitespace with `$IFS`.
- The vulnerability was present in DD-WRT's 24 sp1 firmware version.
- A temporary fix involves blocking access to any URL containing "cgi-bin" using firewall rules.
- DD-WRT developers patched the vulnerability in subsequent builds.
