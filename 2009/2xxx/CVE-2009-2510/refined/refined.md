  "CVE-2009-2510": {
    "description": "A spoofing vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI component when parsing ASN.1 information from X.509 certificates. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could impersonate another user or system.",
    "root_cause": "The Windows CryptoAPI incorrectly parses a null terminator as the end of any values identified by an Object Identifier (OID). This causes the CryptoAPI to only parse part of the actual value.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of null terminators in X.509 certificate parsing.",
      "Incorrect parsing of ASN.1 data."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker may be able to impersonate another user or system. Applications using the CryptoAPI to parse this data may return information to the user that could lead the user to make incorrect trust decisions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle attacks.",
       "Rogue website serving a malicious certificate with a null terminator in the Common Name (CN) field."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a Certificate Authority trusted by the client to sign a certificate containing a null terminator in the Common Name (CN) field. The attacker needs to set up a rogue website serving this certificate to a Windows computer.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability can be exploited by convincing a Certificate Authority to sign a certificate containing a null terminator in the Common Name (CN) field. The affected systems are primarily clients that browse HTTPS Web sites, or use X.509 certificates, for instance, to protect e-mail conversations."
