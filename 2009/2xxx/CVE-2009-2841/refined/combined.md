#### iOS 3.1.3 and iOS 3.1.3 for iPod touch

* **CoreAudio**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-0036

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.1.2, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.1.2

  Impact: Playing a maliciously crafted mp4 audio file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A buffer overflow exists in the handling of mp4 audio files. Playing a maliciously crafted mp4 audio file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking. Credit to Tobias Klein of trapkit.de for reporting this issue.

* **ImageIO**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2285

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.1.2, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.1.2

  Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted TIFF image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A buffer underflow exists in ImageIO's handling of TIFF images. Viewing a maliciously crafted TIFF image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This issue is addressed through improved bounds checking.

* **Recovery Mode**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2010-0038

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.1.2, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.1.2

  Impact: A person with physical access to a locked device may be able to access the user's data

  Description: A memory corruption issue exists in the handling of a certain USB control message. A person with physical access to the device could use this to bypass the passcode and access the user's data. This issue is addressed through improved handling of the USB control message.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-3384

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.1.2, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.1.2

  Impact: Accessing a maliciously crafted FTP server could result in an unexpected application termination, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution

  Description: Multiple input validation issues exist in WebKit's handling of FTP directory listings. Accessing a maliciously crafted FTP server may lead to information disclosure, unexpected application termination, or execution of arbitrary code. This update addresses the issues through improved parsing of FTP directory listings. Credit to Michal Zalewski of Google Inc. for reporting these issues.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2841

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.1.2, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.1.2

  Impact: Mail may load remote audio and video content when remote image loading is disabled

  Description: When WebKit encounters an HTML 5 Media Element pointing to an external resource, it does not issue a resource load callback to determine if the resource should be loaded. This may result in undesired requests to remote servers. As an example, the sender of an HTML-formatted email message could use this to determine that the message was read. This issue is addressed by generating resource load callbacks when WebKit encounters an HTML 5 Media Element.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.10

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.9.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [libwebkit-1.0-2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit)
  -
  [1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/webkit/1.2.5-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that

use WebKit, such as Epiphany and Midori, to make all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# About the security content of Safari 4.0.4

This document describes the security content of Safari 4.0.4.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see "[How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620)."

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see "[Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222)."

#### Safari 4.0.4

* **ColorSync**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2804

  Available for: Windows 7, Vista, XP

  Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted image with an embedded color profile may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: An integer overflow exists in the handling of images with an embedded color profile, which may lead to a heap buffer overflow. Opening a maliciously crafted image with an embedded color profile may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. The issue is addressed by performing additional validation of color profiles. This issue does not affect Mac OS X v10.6 systems. The issue has already been addressed in Security Update 2009-005 for Mac OS X 10.5.8 systems. Credit: Apple.

* **libxml**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2414, CVE-2009-2416

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Windows 7, Vista, XP

  Impact: Parsing maliciously crafted XML content may lead to an unexpected application termination

  Description: Multiple use-after-free issues exist in libxml2, the most serious of which may lead to an unexpected application termination. This update addresses the issues through improved memory handling. The issues have already been addressed in Mac OS X 10.6.2, and in Security Update 2009-006 for Mac OS X 10.5.8 systems.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2842

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.1 and v10.6.2, Mac OS X Server v10.6.1 and v10.6.2, Windows 7, Vista, XP

  Impact: Using shortcut menu options within a maliciously crafted website may lead to the disclosure of local information

  Description: An issue exists in Safari's handling of navigations initiated via the "Open Image in New Tab", "Open Image in New Window", or "Open Link in New Tab" shortcut menu options. Using these options within a maliciously crafted website could load a local HTML file, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. The issue is addressed by disabling the listed shortcut menu options when the target of a link is a local file.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2816

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.1 and v10.6.2, Mac OS X Server v10.6.1 and v10.6.2, Windows 7, Vista, XP

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may result in unexpected actions on other websites

  Description: An issue exists in WebKit's implementation of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Before allowing a page from one origin to access a resource in another origin, WebKit sends a preflight request to the latter server for access to the resource. WebKit includes custom HTTP headers specified by the requesting page in the preflight request. This can facilitate cross-site request forgery. This issue is addressed by removing custom HTTP headers from preflight requests. Credit: Apple.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-3384

  Available for: Windows 7, Vista, XP

  Impact: Accessing a maliciously crafted FTP server could result in an unexpected application termination, information disclosure, or arbitrary code execution

  Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in WebKit's handling of FTP directory listings. Accessing a maliciously crafted FTP server may lead to information disclosure, unexpected application termination, or execution of arbitrary code. This update addresses the issues through improved parsing of FTP directory listings. These issues do not affect Safari on Mac OS X systems. Credit to Michal Zalewski of Google Inc. for reporting these issues.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2841

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6.1 and v10.6.2, Mac OS X Server v10.6.1 and v10.6.2

  Impact: Mail may load remote audio and video content when remote image loading is disabled

  Description: When WebKit encounters an HTML 5 Media Element pointing to an external resource, it does not issue a resource load callback to determine if the resource should be loaded. This may result in undesired requests to remote servers. As an example, the sender of an HTML-formatted email message could use this to determine that the message was read. This issue is addressed by generating resource load callbacks when WebKit encounters an HTML 5 Media Element. This issue does not affect Safari on Windows systems.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=525791#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-09-25 18:32:41 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way WebKit used to handle media elements (audio and video tags). A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted document, requesting loading of sub-resources (such as remote URLs), which would be normally disallowed by the callback function(s).  Upstream patch: --------------- <http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/49480>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=525791#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-09-25 18:53:16 UTC  ``` This issue affects latest versions of WebKit package, as shipped with Fedora release of 10 and 11 (WebKit-1.1.0-0.16.svn40351.fc10 and WebKit-1.1.1-1.fc11).   This issue affects latest versions of qt package, as shipped with Fedora release of 10 and 11 (qt-4.5.2-3.fc10 and qt-4.5.2-3.fc11).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=525791#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-11-13 13:46:56 UTC  ``` Public now via:   <http://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/apple-patches-critical-safari-vulnerabilities-111109>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=525791#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-11-13 13:57:19 UTC  ``` Comment related to latest Fedora Qt and WebKit updates and this CVE id: ------------------------------------------------------------------------  While the latest versions of Qt and WebKit packages, as shipped with relevant Fedora releases might be vulnerable to this flaw, the patch for this issue was not committed yet, as it needs further review and testing. Once it was proven to be safe, it will be included into current versions of Qt and WebKit packages, as shipped with Fedora.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=525791#c19)  Fedora Update System    2010-07-13 07:38:47 UTC  ``` qt-4.6.3-8.fc13 has been pushed to the Fedora 13 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=525791#c20)  Fedora Update System    2010-07-13 07:42:30 UTC  ``` qt-4.6.3-8.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
