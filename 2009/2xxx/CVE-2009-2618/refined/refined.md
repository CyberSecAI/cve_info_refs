Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection in the `pollID` parameter of the MD-Pro survey module. This occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not directly output the results of the SQL query, making it a "blind" SQL injection. This means an attacker needs to infer the database's content by observing the application's response to crafted queries.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `pollID` parameter before using it in SQL queries, allowing arbitrary SQL code to be injected.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by injecting SQL queries, as demonstrated with the `substring(@@version,1,1)=5` example. This can include database version, schema information, and other stored data.
    *   Full database compromise could be possible, depending on database privileges.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `modules.php` file, specifically targeting the `Surveys` module and the `results` operation, or the `NS-Polls` module and the `index` file. The malicious SQL code is injected via the `pollID` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft effective queries.
    *   **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker requires knowledge of the path to the MD-Pro installation.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability appears exploitable without prior authentication.
