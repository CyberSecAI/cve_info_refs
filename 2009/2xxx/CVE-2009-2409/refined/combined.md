The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Background

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the Sun Java
implementation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below and
the associated Sun Alerts for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted JAR
archive, applet, or Java Web Start application, possibly resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. Furthermore, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of
Service affecting multiple services via several vectors, disclose
information and memory contents, write or execute local files, conduct
session hijacking attacks via GIFAR files, steal cookies, bypass the
same-origin policy, load untrusted JAR files, establish network
connections to arbitrary hosts and posts via several vectors, modify
the list of supported graphics configurations, bypass HMAC-based
authentication systems, escalate privileges via several vectors and
cause applet code to be executed with older, possibly vulnerable
versions of the JRE.

NOTE: Some vulnerabilities require a trusted environment, user
interaction, a DNS Man-in-the-Middle or Cross-Site-Scripting attack.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Sun JRE 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JRE 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JDK 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JDK 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.6.0.17"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.5.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.5.0.22"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.6.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JRE 1.4.x, Sun JDK 1.4.x, Blackdown JRE, Blackdown JDK and
precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.4.x users are strongly advised to unmerge
Java 1.4:

```
 # emerge --unmerge =app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jdk-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jdk
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jre
```

Gentoo is ceasing support for the 1.4 generation of the Sun Java
Platform in accordance with upstream. All 1.4 JRE and JDK versions are
masked and will be removed shortly.

# OpenSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200912-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL might allow remote attackers to conduct
multiple attacks, including the injection of arbitrary data into encrypted
byte streams.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.8l-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.8l-r2** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenSSL:

* Marsh Ray of PhoneFactor and Martin Rex of SAP independently
  reported that the TLS protocol does not properly handle session
  renegotiation requests (CVE-2009-3555).
* The MD2 hash algorithm is no longer considered to be
  cryptographically strong, as demonstrated by Dan Kaminsky. Certificates
  using this algorithm are no longer accepted (CVE-2009-2409).
* Daniel Mentz and Robin Seggelmann reported the following
  vulnerabilities related to DTLS: A use-after-free flaw (CVE-2009-1379)
  and a NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2009-1387) in the
  dtls1\_retrieve\_buffered\_fragment() function in src/d1\_both.c, multiple
  memory leaks in the dtls1\_process\_out\_of\_seq\_message() function in
  src/d1\_both.c (CVE-2009-1378), and a processing error related to a
  large amount of DTLS records with a future epoch in the
  dtls1\_buffer\_record() function in ssl/d1\_pkt.c
  (CVE-2009-1377).

### Impact

A remote unauthenticated attacker, acting as a Man in the Middle, could
inject arbitrary plain text into a TLS session, possibly leading to the
ability to send requests as if authenticated as the victim. A remote
attacker could furthermore send specially crafted DTLS packages to a
service using OpenSSL for DTLS support, possibly resulting in a Denial
of Service. Also, a remote attacker might be able to create rogue
certificates, facilitated by a MD2 collision. NOTE: The amount of
computation needed for this attack is still very large.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8l-r2"
```

Package        : openssl, openssl097
Vulnerability  : cryptographic weakness
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-2409

Certificates with MD2 hash signatures are no longer accepted by OpenSSL,
since they're no longer considered cryptographically secure.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8g-15+lenny5.

For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8c-4etch9 for openssl and version 0.9.7k-3.1etch5 for
openssl097.
The OpenSSL 0.9.8 update for oldstable (etch) also provides updated
packages for multiple denial of service vulnerabilities in the
Datagram Transport Layer Security implementation. These fixes were
already provided for Debian stable (Lenny) in a previous point
update. The OpenSSL 0.9.7 package from oldstable (Etch) is not
affected. (CVE-2009-1377, CVE-2009-1378, CVE-2009-1379,
CVE-2009-1386 and CVE-2009-1387)

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8k-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2010-02-09
Updated:
2010-02-09
# RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes security issues and several
bugs is now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
(RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the IPv6 Extension Header (EH) handling
implementation in the Linux kernel. The skb->dst data structure was not
properly validated in the ipv6\_hop\_jumbo() function. This could possibly
lead to a remote denial of service. (CVE-2007-4567)

The Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team reported two flaws in the routing
implementation. If an attacker was able to cause a large enough number of
collisions in the routing hash table (via specially-crafted packets) for
the emergency route flush to trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if
the kernel routing cache was disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be
left behind after a route lookup, leading to a kernel panic.
(CVE-2009-4272)

A flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in
the Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using packets larger
than the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in
partial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws
could also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.
(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538)

A flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel.
Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network cards
supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of
service. (CVE-2009-4537)

The x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current
Privilege Level (CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL). A user in a guest
could leverage these flaws to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or
possibly escalate their privileges within that guest. (CVE-2010-0298,
CVE-2010-0306)

A flaw was found in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation. Access
to the internal data structure pit\_state, which represents the data state
of the emulated PIT, was not properly validated in the pit\_ioport\_read()
function. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2010-0309)

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2006-6304, CVE-2009-2910,
CVE-2009-3080, CVE-2009-3556, CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, CVE-2009-4020,
CVE-2009-4021, CVE-2009-4138, and CVE-2009-4141; ntp issue CVE-2009-3563;
dbus issue CVE-2009-1189; dnsmasq issues CVE-2009-2957 and CVE-2009-2958;

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* on systems with a large number of disk devices, USB storage devices may

get enumerated after "/dev/sdz", for example, "/dev/sdcd". This was not
handled by the udev rules, resulting in a missing "/dev/live" symbolic
link, causing installations from USB media to fail. With this update, udev
rules correctly handle USB storage devices on systems with a large number
of disk devices, which resolves this issue. (BZ#555083)

As RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from the KVM update
RHSA-2010:0088 have been included in this update:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0088.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=510197#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-08 10:31:13 UTC  ``` In his upcoming Blackhat paper and presentation Dan Kaminsky highlights some more issues he has found relating to SSL hash collisions and related vulnerabilities.  The first issue is the discovery that a widely-trusted Certificate Authority root certificate is self-signed using a MD2 hash.  If an attacker can mint a fake intermediate certificate which has the same MD2 hash then they could use this on a malicious site (or during a man-in-the-middle attack) to present a fake SSL certificate that would be accepted as if it was authentic.  It turns out that there are not many valid MD2 hash certificates around any more, and the main one that exists is at the trusted root level anyway (and there is actually no need for a crypto library to verify the self-signature on a trusted root).  So most vendors have chosen to address this issue by disabling MD2 completely for certificate verification.  There is no immediate panic to address this issue as in order for it to be exploited the attacker would need to create the MD2 collision with the root certificate, something that is as of today a significant amount of effort (even with a highly distributed effort it's a bit outside what is feasible).  So for upstream OpenSSL we have disabled MD2 support completely.  This was done in two stages; the first was a patch in June 2009 (<http://marc.info/?l=openssl-cvs&m=124508133203041&w=2>) that removed the check of a trusted root self-signed certificate.  Then MD2 was disabled in July, (<http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=18381>).  Although there have not yet been any upstream releases containing these fixes, future OpenSSL 0.9.8 (after 0.9.8k), and OpenSSL 1.0.0 releases will contain this fix.  The GnuTLS library has for some time meant to have disabled MD2 support, although due to a broken patch it wasn't actually disabled correctly until the start of 2009.  So this is addressed in GnuTLS versions 2.6.4 and above, and 2.7.4 and above. (<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2008-12/msg00011.html>)  The NSS library since version 3.12.3 (April 2009) has disabled MD2 by default (although legacy applications can turn it back on using an environment variable "NSS_ALLOW_WEAK_SIGNATURE_ALG" if they need to).  Mozilla Firefox since version 3.5 has used this NSS version and therefore MD2 is disabled (<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=471539#c58>)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=510197#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-08 10:37:10 UTC  ``` GnuTLS notes:  Since 2.6.4 and 2.7.4 MD2 hasn't been allowed by default in a chain. It actually was implemented earlier, but the code was broken, so when backporting it'll need several patches.  They also disabled MD5, but if we backport this we do not want to disable MD5 since it will definately break existing things  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnutls-devel/2008-12/msg00011.html>  * Version 2.7.4 (released 2009-01-07) also * Version 2.6.4 (released 2009-02-06)  ** libgnutls: deprecate X.509 validation chains using MD5 and MD2 signatures.

Cox    2009-07-08 19:35:47 UTC  ``` In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Firefox (and related packages) use the system version of NSS.  Therefore as the NSS library is updated to remove MD2 this will cascade into Firefox and related applications.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=510197#c5)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-20 09:01:32 UTC  ``` NSS was rebased today by errata RHBA-2009:1161 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to address other issues.  This therefore disables MD2 in Firefox and related packages.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=510197#c10)  Mark J.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : nss
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-2404 CVE-2009-2408 CVE-2009-2409

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Network Security
Service libraries. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-2404

   Moxie Marlinspike discovered that a buffer overflow in the regular
   expression parser could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-2408

   Dan Kaminsky discovered that NULL characters in certificate
   names could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks by tricking the user
   into accepting a rogue certificate.

CVE-2009-2409

   Certificates with MD2 hash signatures are no longer accepted
   since they're no longer considered cryptograhically secure.

The old stable distribution (etch) doesn't contain nss.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-0lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

# USN-810-1: NSS vulnerabilities

4 August 2009

NSS vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [nss](/security/cves?package=nss) -

## Details

Moxie Marlinspike discovered that NSS did not properly handle regular

expressions in certificate names. A remote attacker could create a

specially crafted certificate to cause a denial of service (via application

crash) or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2009-2404](/security/CVE-2009-2404))

Moxie Marlinspike and Dan Kaminsky independently discovered that NSS did

not properly handle certificates with NULL characters in the certificate

name. An attacker could exploit this to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack

to view sensitive information or alter encrypted communications.

([CVE-2009-2408](/security/CVE-2009-2408))

Dan Kaminsky discovered NSS would still accept certificates with MD2 hash

signatures. As a result, an attacker could potentially create a malicious

trusted certificate to impersonate another site. ([CVE-2009-2409](/security/CVE-2009-2409))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.04

* [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.9.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.9.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.04.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any applications that

use NSS, such as Firefox, to effect the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
