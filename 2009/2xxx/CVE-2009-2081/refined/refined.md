{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes a file based on user-controlled input from the `module` GET parameter without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to information disclosure or code execution if they can include a file containing malicious code.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `module` GET parameter in the `help.php` file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The vulnerability is triggered when magic_quotes_gpc is off and register_globals is on."
