Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of secure file access control in the `cvs.php` script of OCS Inventory NG. The script allows unauthenticated users to specify a file path through the `log` parameter, which is then directly used in `file_exists()` and `file()` functions without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal issue. By manipulating the `log` parameter, an attacker can access files outside the intended directory.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring any authentication.
- **Insecure File Handling:** The application directly uses user-supplied input in file operations, creating a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** Attackers can read any file on the hosting system that the webserver user has access to. This could include sensitive configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `cvs.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OCS Inventory NG server.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and web parameters.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet in `cvs.php` is:
```php
} elseif (isset($_GET['log'])){
    if (file_exists($_GET['rep'].$_GET['log'])){
        $tab = file($_GET['rep'].$_GET['log']);
        while(list($cle,$val) = each($tab)) {
            $toBeWritten  .= $val."\r\n";
        }
        $filename=$_GET['log'];
    }
}
```
- The `$_GET['log']` parameter is directly used in the `file_exists()` and `file()` functions, making it possible to perform directory traversal by providing a relative or absolute file path (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) as the value of the `log` parameter. The `$_GET['rep']` also looks like it could be an attack vector, but the examples show that it is not used when the log parameter is used.

**Example Exploit:**
- `http://example.org/ocsreports/cvs.php?log=/etc/passwd`
