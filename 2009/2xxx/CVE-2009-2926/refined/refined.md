{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the 'competition' parameter within the show_matchs.php script and the 'pageno' parameter in persons.php.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing them to bypass authentication, read sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames, passwords, emails), modify database contents, or potentially gain further access to the server.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests to show_matchs.php with a crafted 'competition' parameter",
    "HTTP GET requests to persons.php with a crafted 'pageno' parameter"
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No prior authentication is required."
