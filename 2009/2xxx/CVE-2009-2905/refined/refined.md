  "CVE-2009-2905": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way newt processes content that is to be displayed in a text dialog box.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (application crash) or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application using the newt library.",
      "Attack vectors": "A local attacker could issue a specially-crafted text dialog box display request (direct or via a custom application).",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system."

    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from how Newt processes content for display in a text dialog box, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow during text reflowing.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow due to incorrect width calculation during text reflowing in textbox.c.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by triggering the overflow with a crafted text dialog box.",
      "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted text dialog box display request, either directly or via a custom application.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker with the ability to execute code on the target system."
