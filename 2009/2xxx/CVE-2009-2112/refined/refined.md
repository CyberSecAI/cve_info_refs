Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the `page_bottom.php` file of PHPFK 7.03. The application improperly handles user-supplied input in the `_FORUM[settings_design_style]` parameter, which allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files.

* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    * **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application does not properly sanitize user input, specifically the `_FORUM[settings_design_style]` parameter. This allows an attacker to specify a path to a local file on the server, leading to its inclusion and execution within the script's context.

* **Impact of exploitation:**
    * **Arbitrary File Reading:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can read any file on the server that the web server process has access to. This can include sensitive files like configuration files, database credentials, and source code.
    * **Potential for further attacks:** Reading sensitive configuration files could provide attackers with further information to escalate their attacks.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information about the server can be disclosed.

* **Attack vectors:**
    * **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `path/include/page_bottom.php` script.
    * **Manipulated parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `_FORUM[settings_design_style]`, which is manipulated to include a local file.
    * **Null Byte Injection:** The exploit uses `%00` to terminate the file path, potentially bypassing sanitization logic by tricking the application into only processing part of the supplied file path, thereby including the attacker-specified file.

* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    * **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    * **No Authentication:** The exploit described in the content does not require any prior authentication.
    * **Understanding of the Application's File Structure:** The attacker needs to know or guess a valid path to a file on the server.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided exploit utilizes a null byte injection (`%00`) which is a common technique to bypass file extension checks, or other sanitization measures.
