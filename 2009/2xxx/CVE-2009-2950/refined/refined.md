Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2009-2950:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content from `ubuntu.com`, `lists.opensuse.org`, and `bugzilla.redhat.com` directly mentions CVE-2009-2950 and describes a vulnerability in OpenOffice.org related to GIF file processing. The `www.openoffice.org` content also provides details on the GIF related issue. The US-CERT advisory also refers to the same issue in its list of Oracle vulnerabilities, and the Gentoo security advisory also confirms it's presence. Therefore, these entries are directly related to this CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

   - **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
      - Heap overflow in the GIF LZW decompression code within OpenOffice.org. Specifically, `GIFLZWDecompressor::GIFLZWDecompressor (source/filter.vcl/lgif/decode.cxx)` does not handle certain lengths correctly during LZW decompression.
      - The vulnerability arises when OpenOffice.org parses GIF files. This can occur with standalone GIF files or GIFs embedded within other OpenOffice.org documents (e.g. ODF).

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
      - Heap overflow vulnerability.
      - Integer overflow during XPM image import.

   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
      - Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org. An attacker could execute commands with the user's level of permissions.
       -Potential for privilege escalation, if user has administrative rights.
      -  The possibility of memory corruption.
      - Bypassing of security controls for VBA macros.
        
   - **Attack Vectors:**
      -  Users opening a specially crafted GIF file (or a document containing a malicious GIF) provided by an attacker.
      - Files can be transferred to the user by network or by email.
      - Malicious files can be present on a website controlled by attacker.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      - Ability to create specially crafted GIF files.
       - Ability to entice the user to open a malicious GIF file or document that has a malicious GIF embedded in it.
        - Can be achieved via email or compromised/controlled websites

**3. Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

   - The `ubuntu.com` content provides information on the specific package versions that address the vulnerability in various Ubuntu releases.
   - The `lists.opensuse.org` content includes information on the affected OpenSUSE versions, as well as the CVSS v2 Base Score of 9.3, indicating a critical severity level. It also provides checksums of updated packages.
    - It clarifies which SUSE products are also affected by the issue.
    - Identifies which openoffice packages are affected specifically.
   - The `www.openoffice.org` content acknowledges "Frank Reißner and Sebastian Apelt from siberas" for reporting the issue, and specifies that the fix is available from OpenOffice.org 3.2 version.
   - The `bugzilla.redhat.com` content also mentions the upstream proposed patch along with the Red Hat Security Advisory id.

**4. Summary**

The collected content provides a detailed look at CVE-2009-2950, revealing a heap overflow vulnerability within OpenOffice.org's GIF processing component, that can lead to arbitrary code execution. Attackers exploit this flaw by enticing users to open malicious files, emphasizing the importance of patching vulnerable software, particularly when using untrusted sources. The advisory details affected systems and the steps to remediate.
