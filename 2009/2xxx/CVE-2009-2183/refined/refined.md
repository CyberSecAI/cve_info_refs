{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the use of the `GLOBALS` array to include files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
	"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution by including a malicious file, disclosure of system information, and execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests with a crafted URL including a `GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]` parameter to specify the malicious file to include (RFI)",
    "HTTP GET requests with a crafted URL including a `GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]` parameter to include a local file (LFI)",
    "HTTP GET requests with a crafted URL including a `listbasedir` parameter to inject a XSS payload."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is explicitly required."
