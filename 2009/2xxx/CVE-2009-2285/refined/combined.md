### Bug Description

dekar@dekar-laptop:~$ lsb\_release -rd

Description: Ubuntu 8.10

Release: 8.10

dekar@dekar-laptop:~$ apt-cache policy libtiff4

libtiff4:

  Installed: 3.8.2-11

  Candidate: 3.8.2-11

  Version table:

 \*\*\* 3.8.2-11 0

        500 <http://ftp.hosteurope.de> intrepid/main Packages

        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

It crashes my Jaunty and my Lenny system as well!

The file has recently been used by hackers to run unsigned code on the Sony PSP console (it also uses libtiff) so it is likely to allow code execution on Ubuntu as well. The PSP has a MIPS CPU so the file I uploaded shouldn't do any harm to a normal x86er system (except the crash) - though I don't guarantee anything ;)

To try the exploit simply extract it to a folder and wait till Nautilus tries to generate a thumbnail. It even crashed my Firefox when I tried to upload it uncompressed.

I can confirm this as well. Simply using tiff2ps (from libtiff-tools) on the file causes a segmentation fault.

Why did you remove the code execution part? If this libtiff exploit is able to execute code on a MIPS CPU it is really likely it could do the same on x86er using exactly the same library! And since code execution is likely it should be critical and not medium!

I've attached the reproduction of the crash in a duplicate bug. At first glance, this appears to be a NULL-offset, but since it's so large, it's unclear if there is arbitrary control over the destination of the %al byte being written.

SegvAnalysis:

 Segfault happened at: 0x7f2131398308: mov %al,(%rcx)

 PC (0x7f2131398308) ok

 source "%al" ok

 destination "(%rcx)" (0x008effff) not located in a known VMA region (needed writable region)!

To speak to your MIPS vs x86 issue, they are different architectures, so it is not immediately obvious if x86 (or Ubuntu, given its ASLR, stack/heap protections, etc) is vulnerable. Regardless, it needs fixing.

Rather, it's walking backwards off the heap. 0x8effff is just before the heap allocation at 0x8f0000. wololo's discussion of the issue is here:

# libTIFF: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200908-03**

Multiple boundary checking vulnerabilities in libTIFF may allow for the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/tiff** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.8.2-r8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.8.2-r8** |

### Background

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tagged
Image File Format) images.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities have been reported in libTIFF:

* wololo reported a buffer underflow in the LZWDecodeCompat() function
  (CVE-2009-2285).
* Tielei Wang of ICST-ERCIS, Peking University reported two integer
  overflows leading to heap-based buffer overflows in the tiff2rgba and
  rgb2ycbcr tools (CVE-2009-2347).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF
file with an application making use of libTIFF or the tiff2rgba and
rgb2ycbcr tools, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.8.2-r8"
```
### References

* [CVE-2009-2285](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2285)
* [CVE-2009-2347](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2347)

  Impact: Mail may load remote audio and video content when remote image loading is disabled

  Description: When WebKit encounters an HTML 5 Media Element pointing to an external resource, it does not issue a resource load callback to determine if the resource should be loaded. This may result in undesired requests to remote servers. As an example, the sender of an HTML-formatted email message could use this to determine that the message was read. This issue is addressed by generating resource load callbacks when WebKit encounters an HTML 5 Media Element.

Package        : tiff
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-2285 CVE-2009-2347
Debian Bug     : 534137

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the library for the
Tag Image File Format (TIFF). The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-2285

   It was discovered that malformed TIFF images can lead to a crash
   in the decompression code, resulting in denial of service.

CVE-2009-2347

   Andrea Barisani discovered several integer overflows, which
   can lead to the execution of arbitrary code if malformed
   images are passed to the rgb2ycbcr or tiff2rgba tools.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.8.2-7+etch3.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.8.2-11.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: libtiff buffer underflow in LZWDecodeCompat

A crafted TIFF can crash libtiff in LZWDecodeCompat via underflow (different
from CVE-2008-2327).

Based on discussions[1] and a quick analysis[2], I don't think this is
exploitable, but it does lead to crashes in any application using libtiff.
I've reported it upstream[3], with the attached patch.

Has anyone else looked this over?

I cannot see any potential problems with the patch, though I'm not clear whether there may be other similar problems still in tif_lzw.c.  Thanks! ```  ------- *Comment [#3](show_bug.cgi?id=2065#c3) From Frank Warmerdam  2009-06-22 13:20:31* ------- ``` Somewhat ironically, I had annoying problems with my system today and it turned out to be due to leaving wohoho.tif on the Desktop where it crashed nautilus! ```  ------- *Comment [#4](show_bug.cgi?id=2065#c4) From Jeffrey Pfau  2009-06-23 21:12:22* ------- ``` It should be noted that this is a duplicate of [http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1985](show_bug.cgi?id=1985 "RESOLVED FIXED - Buffer underflow in LZW decoding routines")  My patch for that bug actually patches the root cause of the underflow instead of just breaking the infinite loop when it comes up. ```  ------- *Comment [#5](show_bug.cgi?id=2065#c5) From Kees Cook  2009-06-23 22:03:30* ------- ``` Ah!  I had assumed that was a different issue because all the error messages said "LZWDecode" instead "LZWDecodeCompat".   Looking at line numbers, I see that the second hunk of the patch is in LZWDecodeCompat.  (Perhaps adjust the error message at some point?)  Thanks! ```  ------- *Comment [#6](show_bug.cgi?id=2065#c6) From Jeffrey Pfau  2009-06-23 23:49:06* ------- ``` Yeah, those error messages were like that when I started. I thought about changing that in the patch, but thought it was better for a different patch. Either way, the patch attached to this bug will prevent the loop from stomping outside of its bounds, but it does not keep it from stomping all over its own memory. The underflow is (thankfully) only caused by malformed TIFFs, whereby the internal structure governing the loop says the next thing to be copied is itself. My patch prevents the structure from getting in the loop to begin with. I have additional research on this bug, if necessary. Documentation is kind of scarce, though, and most of it is up in my head. However, the reason it gets into the loop is because it processes character codes over 255 specially, and when it a CODE_CLEAR (telling the LZW decoding routine to reset the table) followed by something above CODE_CLEAR (generally something in the LZW table), that portion of the table is undefined. It is illegal to reference this, so my patch tells the routine to stop decoding, instead of having undefined behavior (which, in this case, results in an underflow, but with the patch attached to this bug, it stops the loop before it goes out of bounds, and then happily continues on). ```  ------- *Comment [#7](show_bug.cgi?id=2065#c7) From Tom Lane  2009-06-29 16:21:37* ------- ``` FWIW, I'm planning to use the patch in [bug #1985](show_bug.cgi?id=1985 "RESOLVED FIXED - Buffer underflow in LZW decoding routines"), and not this one, in Red Hat's libtiff packages. The earlier patch cures the problem AFAICT and provides much more desirable error handling behavior. ```  ------- *Comment [#8](show_bug.cgi?id=2065#c8) From Frank Warmerdam  2009-06-30 04:19:06* ------- ``` I have backed out the #2065 patch, and applied the #1985 patch in CVS head (libtiff4), but not in the 3.9 branch. ``` |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

You saw that a new comment was posted to [3] that points to an earlier
bug and a different patch, right?  Looks like it was just updated today,
to point to this bug report from january:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1985>

Also, that report seems to agree with your quick analysis:

"However, the previous patch does appear to prevent a payload of more than one distinct byte,
making this effectively useless as a code injection vector. Nonetheless, it
still is effective at crashing applications that use LibTIFF."

In fact, I think the reporter of that bug was one of the writers in the
lan.st forum notes you're showing, particularly based on this comment
where he indicates it isn't exploitable and that he filed a bug:

<http://www.lan.st/showpost.php?p=13094&postcount=58>
