  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "exploit-db.com",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an SQL injection flaw in the authentication mechanism, allowing an attacker to bypass the login system, combined with a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure handling of user input in the login form, specifically within the username field.",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS due to insufficient input sanitization of user-provided data when creating and displaying pages, specifically within the title and content fields of the new page creation functionality."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the administrative login, gain access to the admin panel, and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the admin session.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "SQL Injection: By injecting SQL code into the username field of the admin login form, an attacker can bypass the authentication process.",
        "XSS: By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the title and content fields when creating a new page, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts when that page is viewed by an admin."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application's login page and the page creation functionality in the admin panel. No prior authentication is needed to exploit the SQL injection."
