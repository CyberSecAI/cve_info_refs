Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Yogurt 0.3 related to CVE-2009-2034:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `index.php` script directly outputs user-supplied input from the `msg` GET parameter without sanitization or encoding.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The `writemessage.php` script directly includes user-supplied input from the `original` GET parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XSS Vulnerability:**
    *   In `index.php`, the script uses `print("<center>". $_GET['msg'] . "</center>");` which is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
    *   The `$_GET['msg']` is not filtered or sanitized.
*   **SQL Injection Vulnerability:**
    *   In `system/writemessage.php`, the script uses `$rs = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM messages WHERE id=" . $_GET['original'], $db)` to construct a SQL query, which is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   The `$_GET['original']` is not filtered or sanitized before being used in the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which can be executed in the victim's browser. This could be used to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, or perform other actions on the user's behalf.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive data from the database (e.g., usernames and passwords) or perform unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `msg` parameter and tricks a user into visiting the link.
*   **SQLi:** An attacker crafts a URL containing a malicious SQL payload in the `original` parameter after authenticating.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking on it.
*   **SQLi:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with SQL injection payloads and authenticate with the application. The `register_globals=on` setting is required for exploitation.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   The exploit-db entry notes the specific vulnerable lines of code and provides proof-of-concept (PoC) URLs demonstrating exploitation of both vulnerabilities.
*   It indicates that the SQLi vulnerability requires that `register_globals=on`.
*   The entry highlights that other PHP files within the application may have similar vulnerabilities.
*   The entry also provides links to the vulnerable application on Sourceforge and a search dork for finding vulnerable instances.
