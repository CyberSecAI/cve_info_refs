Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-2242:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insecure coding practices in the "ASP inline Corporate Calendar" application, specifically in how it handles user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the `active_appointments.asp` page. This occurs due to the lack of proper sanitization/validation of user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The application is vulnerable to XSS in the `search.asp` page. This arises because the application fails to sanitize/encode user-provided data before displaying it within the web page, enabling an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server, leading to data breaches or complete compromise of the database.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, phishing attacks or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `active_appointments.asp` page. The vulnerability exists in the `sortby` parameter of the URL, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `search.asp` page. The vulnerability exists in the `keyword` parameter of the URL, where an attacker can inject malicious script code. The exploit also shows that a POST request can be used to inject the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. This typically means they must have network access to the server running the application and knowledge of the vulnerable URLs/parameters.
*   No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities.
