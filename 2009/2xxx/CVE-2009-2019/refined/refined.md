Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-2019:

**Summary:**

The content from exploit-db.com indicates that CVE-2009-2019 is associated with a vulnerability in Virtue News, a web application. This vulnerability is related to both SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Details:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is due to improper handling of user-supplied input within the Virtue News application. Specifically, the `nid` parameter in `news_detail.php` is vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input passed via the `nid` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
    *  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application also fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input in the `nid` parameter before displaying it in the web page, leading to XSS.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the database, modify data, or potentially gain control of the database server itself.
    *   **XSS:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into the web page, which can be executed by other users visiting the site. This can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, or further malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to the `news_detail.php` page, specifically by manipulating the value of the `nid` parameter in the query string.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special privileges or specific network positions are required.

**Exploit Examples:**

The provided exploit-db.com content includes examples of how these vulnerabilities can be exploited:
*   **SQL Injection:** `http://www.virtuenetz.com/news/news_detail.php?nid=-2+UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,password,5,6,7+from+admin--`
