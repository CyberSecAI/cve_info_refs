| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=441971#c0)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2008-04-10 21:55:28 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #183499](show_bug.cgi?id=183499) +++  Problem description: After login to the system in the GNOME GUI mode, Ctrl+Alt+Bksp resets the X server. After several times of resetting X server in this way, the X windows goes down and stays down without being restarted. What should happen is the X window should restart after several seconds and return to the GUI login. Note that, If I use KDE, no such problem.   Hardware Environment     Machine type: Intellistation M Pro (6218). But this defect can also be     reproduced on other machine, so it is not machine dependent.  Is this reproducible? Yes.     If so, how long does it (did it) take to reproduce it? Very often     Describe the steps:  1. GUI login to GNOME session. 2. Hit Ctrl+Alt+Bksp to reset the X server. 3. It will (or will not ) come to GUI login panel. 4. If it comes to GUI login panel, then repeat step1 to 3.  5. Finally the X windows goes down and stays down without being restarted.    Additional information: The gdm version in RHEL4U2 is 2.6.0.5  I was able to recreate this issue on a x86-64 m/c with RHEL4 U2 on it - though  it took some 8-10 tries. This event sent from IssueTracker by alanm  [SEG - Desktop]  issue 83229  -- Additional comment from tao on 2006-03-01 10:48 EST -- From User-Agent: XML-RPC  I'm not reproducing the exact problem described here (everytime I use ctrl-alt-bksp after being logged in I always go back to the gdm login screen). If I hit ctrl-alt-bksp in the gdm login screen I will sometimes see it restart with xdm instead after getting a message that gdb had crashed.  ----- Additional Comments From mranweil.com (prefers email at mjr.com)  2007-08-10 13:43 EDT ------- fyi - I can recreate this on the RHEL5 base.  Doesn't look like there's a fix for 4.6 at this point, so maybe we want to look at fixing RHEL5 first.    This event sent from IssueTracker by Glen Johnson   issue 83229  -- Additional comment from rstrode on 2008-04-10 16:59 EST -- I was able to reproduce both issues and address them.  Problem should be fixed in gdm-2.6.0.5-7.rhel4.18  marking MODIFIED for QA.  (note this bug is a duplicate of [bug 165515](show_bug.cgi?id=165515 "CLOSED ERRATA - [RHEL4] gdm doesn't always respawn itself when the user presses ctrl-alt-backspace"))  We should clone this bug to address it in RHEL5, as per [comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=441971#c41)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=441971#c1)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2008-04-10 21:56:23 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 302080](attachment.cgi?id=302080&action=diff "fix ctrl-alt-backspace shortly after login makes gdm restart slow/ not at all") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=302080&action=edit "fix ctrl-alt-backspace shortly after login makes gdm restart slow/ not at all") fix ctrl-alt-backspace shortly after login makes gdm restart slow/ not at all   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=441971#c2)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2008-04-10 21:57:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 302081](attachment.cgi?id=302081&action=diff "get rid of the \"Greeter appears to be crashing, staring plain greeter\" message when ctrl-alt-backspacing within 5 seconds of login screen loading") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=302081&action=edit "get rid of the \"Greeter appears to be crashing, staring plain greeter\" message when ctrl-alt-backspacing within 5 seconds of login screen loading") get rid of the "Greeter appears to be crashing, staring plain greeter" message when ctrl-alt-backspacing within 5 seconds of login screen loading   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=441971#c4)  Daniel Riek    2008-07-29 21:06:46 UTC  ``` Moving to 5.4 because of re-prioritization.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=441971#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-09-02 11:28:36 UTC  ``` An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on therefore solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=239818#c0)  Tomas Janousek    2007-05-11 14:50:00 UTC  ``` Description of problem: gdm used to be built with tcp_wrappers on previous RHEL releases, although the BuildRequires was missing there as well. The tcp_wrappers package just happened to appear in the buildroot.  I believe it's nice to be able to limit XDMCP connections using hosts.{allow,deny}.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): gdm-2.16.0-30.el5   Additional info: If you're going to fix this, don't forget that [bug 181302](show_bug.cgi?id=181302 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2007-5079 gdm with xdmcp ignoring tcp_wrappers on x86_64") applies here as well.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=239818#c5)  RHEL Program Management    2008-09-25 15:22:38 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion, but this component is not scheduled to be updated in the current Red Hat Enterprise Linux release. If you would like this request to be reviewed for the next minor release, ask your support representative to set the next rhel-x.y flag to "?".   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=239818#c6)  Alan Matsuoka    2009-02-06 17:33:09 UTC  ``` I'll need the 5.3 flag cleared.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=239818#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-09-02 11:28:30 UTC  ``` An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

Low: gdm security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1364)

## Topic

Updated gdm packages that fix a security issue and several bugs are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

The GNOME Display Manager (GDM) is a configurable re-implementation of XDM,
the X Display Manager. GDM allows you to log in to your system with the X
Window System running, and supports running several different X sessions on
your local machine at the same time.

A flaw was found in the way the gdm package was built. The gdm package was
missing TCP wrappers support, which could result in an administrator
believing they had access restrictions enabled when they did not.
(CVE-2009-2697)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* the GDM Reference Manual is now included with the gdm packages. The

gdm-docs package installs this document in HTML format in
"/usr/share/doc/". (BZ#196054)

* GDM appeared in English on systems using Telugu (te\_IN). With this

update, GDM has been localized in te\_IN. (BZ#226931)

* the Ctrl+Alt+Backspace sequence resets the X server when in runlevel 5.

In previous releases, however, repeated use of this sequence prevented GDM
from starting the X server as part of the reset process. This was because
GDM sometimes did not notice the X server shutdown properly and would
subsequently fail to complete the reset process. This update contains an
added check to explicitly notify GDM whenever the X server is terminated,
ensuring that resets are executed reliably. (BZ#441971)

* the "gdm" user is now part of the "audio" group by default. This enables

audio support at the login screen. (BZ#458331)

* the gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c source code contained incorrect

XInput code that prevented tablet devices from working properly. This
update removes the errant code, ensuring that tablet devices work as
expected. (BZ#473262)

* a bug in the XOpenDevice() function prevented the X server from starting

whenever a device defined in "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" was not actually plugged
in. This update wraps XOpenDevice() in the gdk\_error\_trap\_pop() and
gdk\_error\_trap\_push() functions, which resolves this bug. This ensures that
the X server can start properly even when devices defined in
"/etc/X11/xorg.conf" are not plugged in. (BZ#474588)

All users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these
issues. GDM must be restarted for this update to take effect. Rebooting
achieves this, but changing the runlevel from 5 to 3 and back to 5 also
restarts GDM.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=474588#c0)  Olivier Fourdan    2008-12-04 15:55:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 325697](attachment.cgi?id=325697&action=diff "Patch for current gdm-2.16 package in EL5") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=325697&action=edit "Patch for current gdm-2.16 package in EL5") Patch for current gdm-2.16 package in EL5  Description of problem:  The gdmgreeter will fail to start if a xinput device is defined in the xorg.conf but is not actually plugged in.  This happens for example when a Wacom tablet was added in xorg.conf but the device is not plugged in when gdm starts.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):      gdm-2.16.0-46  How reproducible:      100% reproducible  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Add devices to teh xorg.conf          InputDevice    "stylus" "SendCoreEvents"         InputDevice    "eraser" "SendCoreEvents"         InputDevice    "cursor" "SendCoreEvents"          Section "InputDevice"                 Identifier  "stylus"                 Driver      "wacom"         ...         EndSection                  Section "InputDevice"                 Identifier  "eraser"                 Driver      "wacom"         ...         EndSection                  Section "InputDevice"                 Identifier  "cursor"                 Driver      "wacom"         ...         EndSection  2. Do _not_ plug any additional device 3. Restart gdm    Actual results:      “The greeter application appears to be crashing.      Attempting to use a different one.”  Expected results:  The greeter is displayed correctly.  Additional info:  The problem comes from the additional modules dwellmouselistener and keymouselistener which try to open the extended devices reported by XInput without checking for errors.  In gui/modules/keymouselistener.c and gui/modules/dwellmouselistener.c, the same code is duplicated and does:      static void    init_xinput (GdkDisplay *display, GdkWindow *root)    {    ...        devices = XListInputDevices (GDK_DISPLAY_XDISPLAY (display),            &num_devices);     ...         for (i=0; i < num_devices; i++) {            if (devices[i].use == IsXExtensionDevice) {                device = XOpenDevice (GDK_DISPLAY_XDISPLAY (display),                    devices[i].id);                for (j=0; j < device->num_classes && number < 39; j++) {                    switch (device->classes[j].input_class)                    {     ...  That code works in most cases, except when the device is defined but not actually there, in which case the call to XOpenDevice() will cause an X error. Since there is no mechanism in place to trap that error, the gdmgreeter will fail and cause the error reported.  The proper way (IMHO) to handle this is to protect the call to XOpenDevice() by wrapping it in an X error handler, ie change the code to:     static void    init_xinput (GdkDisplay *display, GdkWindow *root)    {    ...        devices = XListInputDevices (GDK_DISPLAY_XDISPLAY (display),            &num_devices);     ...         for (i=0; i < num_devices; i++) {            if (devices[i].use == IsXExtensionDevice) {                gdk_error_trap_push ();                device = XOpenDevice (GDK_DISPLAY_XDISPLAY (display),                    devices[i].id);                if (gdk_error_trap_pop())                {                    if (debug_gestures)                        syslog (LOG_WARNING, "Failed to open input devices %i (%s)",                            devices[i].id, devices[i].name);                    continue;                }                for (j=0; j < device->num_classes && number < 39; j++) {                    switch (device->classes[j].input_class)                    {    ...   The bug is still upstream (at least in gdm that comes with gnome-2.20, the last one before gdm was changed).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=474588#c1)  Olivier Fourdan    2008-12-04 15:59:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 325700](attachment.cgi?id=325700&action=diff "Same patch if the one from bz#473262 is applied") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=325700&action=edit "Same patch if the one from bz#473262 is applied") Same patch if the one from [bz#473262](show_bug.cgi?id=473262 "CLOSED ERRATA - Mouse cursor not movable when using tablet instead of mouse") is applied  Now, this patch modifies a part of the code that is modified by another patch for [BZ#473262](show_bug.cgi?id=473262 "CLOSED ERRATA - Mouse cursor not movable when using tablet instead of mouse") (“Mouse cursor not movable when using tablet instead of mouse”)  The patch for [BZ#473262](show_bug.cgi?id=473262 "CLOSED ERRATA - Mouse cursor not movable when using tablet instead of mouse") removes the XInput code from “dwellmouselistener.c” so if that other patch for [BZ#473262](show_bug.cgi?id=473262 "CLOSED ERRATA - Mouse cursor not movable when using tablet instead of mouse") is applied, then better use this one patch that fixes only the portion remaining in “keymouselistener.c”   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=474588#c3)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2009-01-05 17:48:08 UTC  ``` devack+   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=474588#c4)  Ray Strode [halfline]    2009-05-12 14:40:40 UTC  ``` building as gdm-2.16.0-49.el5 now.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=239818#c0)  Tomas Janousek    2007-05-11 14:50:00 UTC  ``` Description of problem: gdm used to be built with tcp_wrappers on previous RHEL releases, although the BuildRequires was missing there as well. The tcp_wrappers package just happened to appear in the buildroot.  I believe it's nice to be able to limit XDMCP connections using hosts.{allow,deny}.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): gdm-2.16.0-30.el5   Additional info: If you're going to fix this, don't forget that [bug 181302](show_bug.cgi?id=181302 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2007-5079 gdm with xdmcp ignoring tcp_wrappers on x86_64") applies here as well.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=239818#c5)  RHEL Program Management    2008-09-25 15:22:38 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion, but this component is not scheduled to be updated in the current Red Hat Enterprise Linux release. If you would like this request to be reviewed for the next minor release, ask your support representative to set the next rhel-x.y flag to "?".   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=239818#c6)  Alan Matsuoka    2009-02-06 17:33:09 UTC  ``` I'll need the 5.3 flag cleared.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=239818#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-09-02 11:28:30 UTC  ``` An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on therefore solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1364.html>   ``` |  |
