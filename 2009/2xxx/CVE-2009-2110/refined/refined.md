```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application includes files based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization. The vulnerable code is located within the `index.php`, `full.php`, and `contact.php` files.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application uses the `u` parameter from the query string to include files, using `include "./sites/session/$u.session.php"` and `include "./sites/$u.php";`. The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to control the included files via path traversal.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include arbitrary files from the local file system. This allows an attacker to read sensitive files from the server such as configuration files, source code, or potentially execute arbitrary code if they can include a PHP file containing malicious code.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request, specifically by manipulating the `u` parameter in the URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and must be able to manipulate the `u` parameter. No prior authentication is needed.
