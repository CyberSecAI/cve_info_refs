- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `SIOCSIFINFO_IN6` ioctl is missing a necessary permissions check.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing permission check, allowing unauthorized access to modify IPv6 interface properties.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local users, including non-root users and users inside jails, can modify IPv6 interface properties such as changing the link MTU and disabling interfaces. This affects IPv6 only and not IPv4.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local user access, including non-root and users inside jails.
