Package: xcftools
Version: 1.0.4-1
Severity: important

I really like the xcftools package, because it lets me author things
in Gimp and then automate operations on them (e.g. let a Makefile
generate jpeg images from a sandwhich of layers). However, this bug is
a problem for me currently:

I try to extract individual layers, clipped to the canvas size. It
seems that at least sometimes, for at least some layers which extends
past the edges of the canvas, xcf2pnm fails.  On this amd64 system, it
passes an unreasonable size to malloc().  On my PPC Debian 4.0 system
and xcftools (1.0.4-1) it dies with SIGILL instead. Possibly, almost
anything can happen.

xcf2png fails in the same way.

Some might suspect that this as a security issue. I have chosen not to
file it as such, but feel free to raise the severity if you think it's
important.

I have attached two minimal example files (gzipped).  The -bigcanvas
variant was created in Gimp with "Fit canvas to layers". And here is a
terminal session which shows the problem:

I'd really appreciate a fix. I could try debugging it myself, but I have a
feeling someone else (e.g. the upstream author) who knows XXF better can
succeed in an hour or so.

tags 533361 patch security
thanks

Upstream auhor of xcftools here.
Thanks for this bug report.

There is indeed a possible buffer overflow when the converted part of
the image extends above or to the left of the canvas. It was caused by
me foolishly assuming that C's modulus operator bevhaves sanely on
negative numbers.

A patch that ought to fix this is attached.
Jörgen, can you check whether this does fix your problem?
If so, I'll release a fixed version as 1.0.5 asap.

I don't THINK we need to go into a full-tilt security panic for this
one. Yes, the stack gets overwritten, but only if the -C or -O options
are used to shift the origin. Therefore, in order to mount an attack
one not only has to trick the victim into converting an appropriately
crafted image, but also to use one of these "advanced" options.
I'll tag it "security" nonetheless, so that others get a chance
to weigh in.

thanks

Hi,

this issue got a CVE id:

[CVE-2009-2175](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2175)[0]:
| Stack-based buffer overflow in the flattenIncrementally function in
| flatten.c in xcftools 1.0.4, as reachable from the (1) xcf2pnm and (2)
| xcf2png utilities, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
| service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
| image that causes a consersion to a location "above or to the left of
| the canvas." NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
| information.

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE id in your changelog entry.

For further information see:

Henning, sorry for not replying earlier -- I somehow believed the BTS
would Cc: me on everything, and didn't check the web interface until
today.

I tested your patch 533361.patch posted on the 19th, and of course it
fixed the crash (on amd64 and ppc) for both the test data attached to
the bug, and for my real data. Thanks for the quick response!

However, the resulting image still looks strange. I have attached yet
another example.

    salix:/tmp/xcfbug% xcfinfo debian-logo.xcf
    Version 0, 10x10 RGB color, 3 layers, compressed RLE
    + 48x48-18-18 RGB-alpha Normal L3
    + 48x48-18-18 RGB-alpha Normal L2
    + 48x48-18-18 RGB-alpha Normal L1
    salix:/tmp/xcfbug% xcf2png -b white -C debian-logo.xcf L2 > L2.png

At first I expected L2.png to contain only the visible 10x10 center
part of layer L2. Then I reread the man page and realized that -C was
documented as the other way around.

What L2.png actually contains is the 10x10 canvas-visible part and
everything to the south and east of that. The rest is clipped, i.e.
filled -b white. I have other examples where *parts* of the layer
to the N and W of the canvas are retained, while others are filled
with the background color.

This *feels* like a bug. But I won't insist, since (a) it's not clear
which behavior a user would want in this case and (b) the
documentation for -C only talks about *cropping* to the layers, not
*expanding*.

Also, for me personally, this doesn't matter because now that xcf2pnm
no longer crashes, I can see that I do not want the -C effect. I want
my layers clipped to the canvas, just like xcf2pnm does by default.

many thanks,
/Jörgen

I thought that too -- otherwise I'd have Cc'ed you directly.

Yes, this is a bug. There were a few more places where I had stored
canvas-based coordinates in unsigned variables. Embarassing.

The attached patch ought to fix fixed all known cases. It is based on
the clean 1.0.4 source.

I don't think any of the newly fixed places are security
relevant. They just cause parts of the source image to be ignored, or
in certain cases wrong pixels to be read. So if someone does a
security upload to lenny, the previous patch is probably the least
invasive one to use.

I plan to release 1.0.5 with the fixes Thursday or Friday -- other
stuff gets in the way until then.

I will try to think of improvements to the wording of the manpage such
that others will not be similarly confused. Suggestions welcome.

Good, I've prepared a QA upload to fix this serious bug. CC'ing
debian-qa to get attention of possible sponsors.

Oops, hold that thought. There's already an 1.0.6, upstream source at
<http://henning.makholm.net/xcftools/>

It fixes two completely unrelated bugs that I ran into mere hours
after releasing 1.0.5. It also changes license terms from GPL2 to
Publid Domain.

Such flurry of activity after 2+ years of stasis ...

Thanks, Jan, for taking hand of this.

Wow, that was fast. Thank you very much! I'll prepare a package for
stable and oldstable hopefully tomorrow is the security team doesn't do
it before I come to it... :)

Changes:
 xcftools (1.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=high
 .
   * Adopted (Closes: #[525920](bugreport.cgi?bug=525920))
     + with urgency=high for the security issue
     + with new debian/copyright according to upstream's relicensing
   * New upstream release (1.0.7)
     + Fix GPL-to-PD transition: missed copyright blurb in online banner.
   * IMPORTANT CHANGE: xcfview is rewritten to use xdg-utils in order to find
     an image viewer instead of parsing /etc/mailcap on its own
 .
   * New upstream release (1.0.6)
     + Change licensing from GPL-2 to PD.
     + Fix bug: A layer without an alpha channel bug with an active layer mask
       was wrongly considered to obscure all lower layers.
     + Fix bug: xcf2pnm would guess PBM as the output format even if the
       background was explicitly set to an intermediate gray, or if -T might
       produce grays.
 .
   * New upstream release (1.0.5)
     + Fix various bugs if extracted part of image contains pixels with
       negative canvas-based coordinates. Thanks Jörgen Grahn (Closes: #[533361](bugreport.cgi?bug=533361),
       [CVE-2009-2175](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2175))
     + Minor manpage fixes; -C description should be less confusing now.
     + $(DESTDIR) honored in Makefile's install target
   * Use quilt for patches
   * Bump standards-version: 3.8.2
   * Added debian/watch
   * Switched to debhelper 7

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| **Description** | Stack-based buffer overflow in the flattenIncrementally function in flatten.c in xcftools 1.0.4, as reachable from the (1) xcf2pnm and (2) xcf2png utilities, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted image that causes a conversion to a location "above or to the left of the canvas." NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information. |
