```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how the `flattenIncrementally` function handles canvas-based coordinates, particularly when converting parts of an image that extend above or to the left of the canvas. This was caused by the developer incorrectly assuming the modulus operator's behavior on negative numbers in C.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `flattenIncrementally` function.

Impact of exploitation:
Successful exploitation can lead to a denial of service (crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability can be triggered through the `xcf2pnm` and `xcf2png` utilities by processing a specially crafted XCF image that causes a conversion to a location "above or to the left of the canvas." The `-C` or `-O` options must be used to shift the origin and trigger the vulnerability.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
An attacker needs to trick a victim into processing a crafted image file using `xcf2pnm` or `xcf2png` with the `-C` or `-O` options.
