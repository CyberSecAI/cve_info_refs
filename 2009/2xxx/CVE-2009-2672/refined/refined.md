  "CVE-2009-2672": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with the SOCKS proxy implementation might allow an untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to determine the user name of the user running the applet or application. A second vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with the proxy mechanism implementation might allow an untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to obtain browser cookies and leverage those cookies to hijack sessions.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the proxy mechanism implementation of the Java Runtime Environment. Specifically, the way it handles SOCKS proxies allows information leaks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information disclosure through SOCKS proxy handling",
        "Session hijacking via cookie theft"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could obtain sensitive information such as usernames and browser cookies, which could then be used for session hijacking attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An untrusted applet or Java Web Start application running in a vulnerable Java environment."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to run an untrusted applet or Java Web Start application, and the user must be running a vulnerable version of Java"
    }
