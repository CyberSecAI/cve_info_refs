Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-2220:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple instances of XSS vulnerabilities are present in the application.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Several LFI vulnerabilities exist in the application.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerabilities stem from insecure handling of user-supplied input and improper file inclusion mechanisms. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user inputs used in template paths, error messages, and forum summaries, leading to both XSS and LFI vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Credential theft
    *   Website defacement
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
*   **LFI:** An attacker can include arbitrary files on the server. This can lead to:
    *   Disclosure of sensitive information, such as configuration files and source code.
    *   Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the attacker can include executable code.
    *   Bypass access restrictions

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Exploited by crafting malicious URLs with payloads in parameters such as `use_template_family`, `errordisplay`, `errormessage`, `template_path`, `forum_summary[title]`, `forum_summary[threadlastpost]`, `forum_summary[replies]`, `forum_summary[threads]`, `forum_summary[description]`, and `tbFootNonStandardFooter`.
*   **LFI:** Exploited by injecting file paths into the `template_path` parameter in the vulnerable URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs with the vulnerable parameters.
*   The attacker must be able to trick a user into clicking on a malicious URL or have the user visit a malicious site containing the vulnerable links.
*   For LFI, the attacker needs to know the path to the file they want to include.
