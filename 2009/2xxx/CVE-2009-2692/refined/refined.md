{
  "CVE-2009-2692": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the SOCKOPS_WRAP macro in the Linux kernel. This macro did not initialize the sendpage operation in the proto_ops structure correctly. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a local denial of service or escalate their privileges.",
    "Root cause": "The SOCKOPS_WRAP macro in the Linux kernel does not initialize the sendpage operation in the proto_ops structure correctly.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect initialization of the sendpage operation in proto_ops",
      "Lack of NULL pointer checks before dereferencing operations."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local, unprivileged users can cause a local denial of service or escalate their privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation via a socket operation that invokes a flawed sendpage operation.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local, unprivileged access to the system is required."
