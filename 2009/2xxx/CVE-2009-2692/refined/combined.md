# RHSA-2009:1223 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1223)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

These updated packages fix the following security issues:

* a flaw was found in the SOCKOPS\_WRAP macro in the Linux kernel. This

macro did not initialize the sendpage operation in the proto\_ops structure
correctly. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a local
denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2692, Important)

* a flaw was found in the udp\_sendmsg() implementation in the Linux kernel

when using the MSG\_MORE flag on UDP sockets. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to cause a local denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2009-2698, Important)

Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google
Security Team for responsibly reporting these flaws.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice.org fixes potential buffer overflow in EMF
parser code (enhwmf.cxx, emfplus.cxx). Additionally Secunia reported an
integer underflow (CVE-2009-0200) and a buffer overflow (CVE-2009-0201)
that could be triggered while parsing Word documents.
Also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.1.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.1.1.html>
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, NLD9, SLE10, SLE11
- dnsmasq
This update fixes a buffer overflow in the TFTP server code of dnsmasq.
Please note that the TFTP server is disabled by default.
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE11
- gnutls
This update of gnutls improves the verification of the domain/subject
names in a SSL certificate. CVE-2009-2730 has been assigned to this
issue.
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10, SLE11
- ia32el
A 32bit x86 user program could crash the Itanium IA64 kernel in the
IA 32 (Intel 32bit) emulation. (CVE-2009-2707)
Released for product: SLE10
Updateing IA32EL to 7042\_7022, the same version as shipped on SLES 10
SP3, fixes this problem.
- ib-bonding-kmp-rt/kernel-rt/ofed
This patch updates the SLERT10 SP2 kernel to Update 7 to address
multiple issues:
- Lots of HR Timer fixes and improvements.
The complete list of changes can be seen in the rpm changelog.
It also fixes several security issues, some of the critical:
CVE-2009-2692: A missing NULL pointer check in the socket sendpage
function can be used by local attackers to gain root privileges.
CVE-2009-2406: A kernel stack overflow when mounting eCryptfs filesystems
in parse\_tag\_11\_packet() was fixed. Code execution might be possible
of ecryptfs is in use.
CVE-2009-2407: A kernel heap overflow when mounting eCryptfs filesystems
in parse\_tag\_3\_packet() was fixed. Code execution might be possible
of ecryptfs is in use.
Released for product: SLERT10
- libxml
This update of libxml does not use pointers after they were freed
anymore. (CVE-2009-2416)
Additionally a stack-based buffer overflow was fixed while parsing the
root XML document. (CVE-2009-2414)
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- opera
Opera version 10 includes at least security fixes for an XML
denial-of-service bug (CVE-2009-1234) and the "SSL tampering" attack
(CVE-2009-2059, CVE-2009-2063, CVE-2009-2067, CVE-2009-2070).
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- perl-IO-Socket-SSL
This update of perl-IO-Socket-SSL improves the hostname checking of the
SSL certificate. (CVE-2009-3024)
Released for product: openSUSE 11.1, SLE11
- xen
xend did not properly enforce access control of the xenstore
directory tree, therefore allowing guest VM's to write there.
This could lead to security problems if other applications such as
libvirt are not prepared for untrusted data in the xenstore
directory (CVE-2008-4405).
Released for product: openSUSE 11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-12 02:26:38 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Reported by Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes. The SOCKOPS_WRAP macro from include/linux/net.h doesn't initialise the sendpage operation in the proto_ops structure correctly. Leading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference, and thus a local privilege escalation.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team for responsibly reporting this flaw.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 00:25:48 UTC  ``` References: <http://blog.cr0.org/2009/08/linux-null-pointer-dereference-due-to.html> <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2009-08/0174.html> <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/36038/info> <http://www.centos.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=21740&forum=42> <http://www.linux-archive.org/centos/352108-kernel-null-pointer-vulnerability.html>  Upstream commit for 2.6: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/e694958388c50148389b0e9b9e9e8945cf0f1b98>  Upstream commit for 2.4: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.4.37.y.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=c18d0fe535a73b219f960d1af3d0c264555a12e3>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c10)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 05:47:26 UTC  ``` CVSS2 score of important, 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)  Note that the CVSS 'access vector' is set to AV:L as this is a vulnerability exploitable with only local access.  Mitigation: It is possible to mitigate this flaw by blacklisting the affected protocols. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of modules to blacklist, but this should prevent the publicly circulated exploit from working properly as this is the list of protocols (relevant to RHEL) known to be affected.  ** Ensure that the module is not already loaded, if not, these mitigation steps will not work.  ** We have used the 'install' command to direct the system to run '/bin/true' instead of actually inserting the kernel module if it is called.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the /etc/modules.conf file:  install bluez /bin/true  Note that the bluez module is from the kernel-unsupported package. If you do not have this package installed, then you do not have this module.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, add these entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install pppox /bin/true install bluetooth /bin/true install sctp /bin/true  Note that the sctp module cannot be unloaded in the running kernel if it is already loaded. You will need to make the changes in the /etc/modprobe.conf file and do a reboot.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise MRG, add these entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install pppox /bin/true install bluetooth /bin/true install appletalk /bin/true install ipx /bin/true install sctp /bin/true  Updated: Aug 17, 2009 20:45 EDT   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c11)  Christopher McCrory    2009-08-14 15:16:53 UTC  ``` re:  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install bluez /bin/true     I think that should be /etc/modules.conf   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c12)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 16:27:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c11)) > re: >  > ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the > /etc/modprobe.conf file: >  > install bluez /bin/true >  > I think that should be /etc/modules.conf    That's right.

The affected module includes PF_APPLETALK, PF_IPX,   PF_IRDA, PF_X25 and PF_AX25 families.  - Initializations were missing in other protocols, including PF_BLUETOOTH,   PF_IUCV, PF_INET6 (with IPPROTO_SCTP), PF_PPPOX and PF_ISDN.  Affected Kernel Modules ======================= ipx.ko  irda.ko x25.ko ax25.ko bluetooth.ko sctp.ko pppoe.ko pppox.ko appletalk.ko  Thanks & Regards -Raghu.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c25)  John Kacur    2009-08-17 13:22:18 UTC  ``` git describe --contains e694958388c50148389b0e9b9e9e8945cf0f1b98 v2.6.31-rc6~8  The current MRG V2 kernel is based off v2.6.31-rc6 - so this is not a problem for us.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c27)  Jeff Huckaby    2009-08-17 14:27:45 UTC  ``` I had an RHEL 4 system compromised today due to this issue.    Using GDB I was able to core dump the processes and found the web site from which they obtained the exploit code. I have copies of the exploit code if someone is interested.  They entered the system through a web application exploit and then used the exploit to gain a root shell.  I have applied the mitigation techniques above until a updated kernel is made available.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c30)  Jeremy West    2009-08-17 17:36:08 UTC  ``` Please note that Bugzilla is not an avenue for technical support.

Please see <http://www.redhat.com/support> for details on contacting Red Hat Support   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c32)  Jonathan Peatfield    2009-08-17 18:18:59 UTC  ``` I think that the point of #24 and probably #27 is that the suggested workround for RHEL4/5 does _not_ close all the possible ways to exploit this exploit, ie adding just:    install pppox /bin/true   install bluetooth /bin/true  will (for example) still allow code using PF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_SCTP to exploit the hole if ipv6 and sctp are available.  One of the links from #5 has some sample exploit code which tried a whole bunch of different options to the socket call to see if any of them work.  BTW I'm puzzled that this bz is still marked as 'new' - surely it ought to have been confirmed and the proposed patches passed to engineering by now...  Maybe that the bug is only regarded as 'important' (well in #10 it is), means that we will have to wait for the next regular kernel update for this to be fixed.   -- Jon   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c34)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-18 00:42:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #32](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c32)) > I think that the point of #24 and probably #27 is that the suggested workround > for RHEL4/5 does _not_ close all the possible ways to exploit this exploit, ie > adding just: >  >   install pppox /bin/true >   install bluetooth /bin/true >  > will (for example) still allow code using PF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_SCTP > to exploit the hole if ipv6 and sctp are available.  As I mentioned in [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c10), this is not an exhaustive list of modules to blacklist. On my test Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 machine, the sctp module does not load automatically when the reproducer is executed. But yes, I will include your suggestion to the existing mitigation steps.  > BTW I'm puzzled that this bz is still marked as 'new' - surely it ought to have > been confirmed and the proposed patches passed to engineering by now...

For every security bug, we have a top-level bug (this one) and several tracking bugs. The top-level bug is only used for tracking purposes, so the status for the top-level bug should not be taken as an indication for anything. Only the status of the tracking bugs matter.

If this is a critical remote exploitable vulnerability, we will give it the highest priority to release a kernel update that addresses the issue.  For this issue, it is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that can be mitigated. For customers who are unable to perform the mitigation steps, they can request for a hotfix (unofficial but supported kernel that has this fix until we are ready to release one) from Red Hat Support.

The problem is, that apache is also a local user, so any server running Apache with PHP, Perl (or any other scripting language) just became a huge risk.   Any PHP script (like your random badly programmed mambo/joomla module) which has a remote file include exploit, just became a very easy way into root access on almost every RHEL and Fedora server.  We've been upgrading 250 servers over the last 5 days with official .src.rpm's of the kernels with our own patched socket.c file in it, in that time we almost had 1 server compromised, so this exploit is certainly in the wild. 'Luckily' the server froze instead of dropping to a root shell.  - Jeroen Wunnink  (Sysadmin at a dutch webhosting company)   ```  [Comment 49](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c49)  Evan Stable    2009-08-21 16:02:49 UTC  ``` Not to mention the fact that Debian and Ubuntu have already released an updated kernel.

Debian and Ubuntu are both free distributions.    What's your point?  Fedora released their update as well.  RHEL's customers tend to be Enterprise users, and while we certainly expect any critical vulnerabilities to be fixed in a timely manner, we also expect thorough testing and QA to be done on any release so as not to interrupt our environments.  This is why we use RHEL and not a "free" distribution. :-)  In any case, this probably isn't the place for this discussion to happen.  If you want the patched kernel faster, get a hotfix from Support and push it out.   ```  [Comment 51](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c51)  Taco Scargo    2009-08-23 08:03:30 UTC  ``` A simple but very needed patch like this should be able to be tested and out to customers as fast as lightning. In my eyes this issue leaves competitors and bashers of Red Hat all the room they would need. I myself am very disappointed in the way that Red Hat addresses this vulnerability.  @Ray Van Dolson: Enterprise customers pay Red Hat to provide a patch instead of needing to create one themselves or rely on the community. I agree that Red Hat's customers expect a tested and Q&A'd kernel release. But due to the severity and exploitability of this flaw, combined with the relative simple fix, should not cause customers to have to wait (more than) two weeks for an updated kernel to be released to customers.  Added to this Red Hat is relatively silent on the ETA of their fixed kernel.   ```  [Comment 52](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c52)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-24 08:12:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1222 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1222.html>   ```  [Comment 53](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c53)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-24 08:29:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1223 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1223.html>   ```  [Comment 54](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c54)  Andrew C Aitchison    2009-08-24 09:09:34 UTC  ``` Ah.

kernel security update (RHSA-2009-1469)

Original Release Date: October 23, 2009

Last Revised: March 15, 2013

Number: ASA-2009-464

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

A flaw exists in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in
the Linux kernel. This driver allowed interfaces using this driver to
receive frames larger than what could be handled. This could lead to a
remote denial of service or code execution.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2009-1389](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1389) to this issue.

A flaw exists in the SOCKOPS\_WRAP macro in the Linux kernel. This macro did not
initialize the sendpage operation in the proto\_ops structure correctly. A
local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a local denial of
service or escalate their privileges.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2009-2692](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2692) to this issue.

A flaw exists in the udp\_sendmsg() implementation in the Linux kernel when using the
MSG\_MORE flag on UDP sockets. A local, unprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause a local denial of service or escalate their privileges.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2009-2698](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2698) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1469.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with RHEL4 kernel installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Communication Manager | 5.2 and earlier | Medium | Upgrade to 5.2.1 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 | Medium | This advisory will not be addressed by Intuity AUDIX LX as no further releases are planned. |
| Avaya Message Storage Server | 3.x, 4.x | Low | Upgrade to 5.2 or later. |
| Avaya Aura™ SIP Enablement Services | 5.2 and earlier | Medium | Upgrade to 5.2.1 or later.| Avaya Voice Portal | 4.1 SP3 and earlier | Medium | Upgrade to 4.1 SP4 or later.| Avaya Meeting Exchange | 5.x | Medium | Upgrade to 6.2 or later. | | Avaya Proactive Contact | 4.1.1 | Medium | Upgrade to 4.1.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services | 4.2.1 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to 4.2.2 or later. | | |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

So, the cat is out of the bag. The exploit is available, but so is the
patch.

c. Third party library update for ntp.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
this advisory.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

g. Updated Service Console package bind

Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5
The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
(column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these
issues.

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-2417 to this issue

j. Updated Service Console package gnutls

Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5\_3.5
A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-2730 to this issue
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability

The SOCKOPS_WRAP macro from include/linux/net.h doesn't initialise the sendpage operation in the proto_ops structure correctly. Leading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference, and thus a local privilege escalation.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team for responsibly reporting this flaw.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 00:25:48 UTC  ``` References: <http://blog.cr0.org/2009/08/linux-null-pointer-dereference-due-to.html> <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2009-08/0174.html> <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/36038/info> <http://www.centos.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=21740&forum=42> <http://www.linux-archive.org/centos/352108-kernel-null-pointer-vulnerability.html>  Upstream commit for 2.6: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/e694958388c50148389b0e9b9e9e8945cf0f1b98>  Upstream commit for 2.4: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.4.37.y.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=c18d0fe535a73b219f960d1af3d0c264555a12e3>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c10)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 05:47:26 UTC  ``` CVSS2 score of important, 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)  Note that the CVSS 'access vector' is set to AV:L as this is a vulnerability exploitable with only local access.  Mitigation: It is possible to mitigate this flaw by blacklisting the affected protocols. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of modules to blacklist, but this should prevent the publicly circulated exploit from working properly as this is the list of protocols (relevant to RHEL) known to be affected.  ** Ensure that the module is not already loaded, if not, these mitigation steps will not work.  ** We have used the 'install' command to direct the system to run '/bin/true' instead of actually inserting the kernel module if it is called.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the /etc/modules.conf file:  install bluez /bin/true  Note that the bluez module is from the kernel-unsupported package. If you do not have this package installed, then you do not have this module.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, add these entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install pppox /bin/true install bluetooth /bin/true install sctp /bin/true  Note that the sctp module cannot be unloaded in the running kernel if it is already loaded. You will need to make the changes in the /etc/modprobe.conf file and do a reboot.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise MRG, add these entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install pppox /bin/true install bluetooth /bin/true install appletalk /bin/true install ipx /bin/true install sctp /bin/true  Updated: Aug 17, 2009 20:45 EDT   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c11)  Christopher McCrory    2009-08-14 15:16:53 UTC  ``` re:  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install bluez /bin/true     I think that should be /etc/modules.conf   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c12)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 16:27:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c11)) > re: >  > ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the > /etc/modprobe.conf file: >  > install bluez /bin/true >  > I think that should be /etc/modules.conf    That's right.

For every security bug, we have a top-level bug (this one) and several tracking bugs. The top-level bug is only used for tracking purposes, so the status for the top-level bug should not be taken as an indication for anything. Only the status of the tracking bugs matter.

If this is a critical remote exploitable vulnerability, we will give it the highest priority to release a kernel update that addresses the issue.  For this issue, it is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that can be mitigated.

The problem is, that apache is also a local user, so any server running Apache with PHP, Perl (or any other scripting language) just became a huge risk.   Any PHP script (like your random badly programmed mambo/joomla module) which has a remote file include exploit, just became a very easy way into root access on almost every RHEL and Fedora server.  We've been upgrading 250 servers over the last 5 days with official .src.rpm's of the kernels with our own patched socket.c file in it, in that time we almost had 1 server compromised, so this exploit is certainly in the wild. 'Luckily' the server froze instead of dropping to a root shell.  - Jeroen Wunnink  (Sysadmin at a dutch webhosting company)   ```  [Comment 49](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c49)  Evan Stable    2009-08-21 16:02:49 UTC  ``` Not to mention the fact that Debian and Ubuntu have already released an updated kernel.

Debian and Ubuntu are both free distributions.    What's your point?  Fedora released their update as well.  RHEL's customers tend to be Enterprise users, and while we certainly expect any critical vulnerabilities to be fixed in a timely manner, we also expect thorough testing and QA to be done on any release so as not to interrupt our environments.  This is why we use RHEL and not a "free" distribution. :-)  In any case, this probably isn't the place for this discussion to happen.

In my eyes this issue leaves competitors and bashers of Red Hat all the room they would need. I myself am very disappointed in the way that Red Hat addresses this vulnerability.  @Ray Van Dolson: Enterprise customers pay Red Hat to provide a patch instead of needing to create one themselves or rely on the community. I agree that Red Hat's customers expect a tested and Q&A'd kernel release. But due to the severity and exploitability of this flaw, combined with the relative simple fix, should not cause customers to have to wait (more than) two weeks for an updated kernel to be released to customers.  Added to this Red Hat is relatively silent on the ETA of their fixed kernel.   ```  [Comment 52](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c52)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-24 08:12:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1222 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1222.html>   ```  [Comment 53](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c53)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-24 08:29:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1223 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1223.html>   ```  [Comment 54](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c54)  Andrew C Aitchison    2009-08-24 09:09:34 UTC  ``` Ah.

# RHSA-2009:1222 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1222)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix two security issues and a bug are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

These updated packages fix the following security issues:

* a flaw was found in the SOCKOPS\_WRAP macro in the Linux kernel. This

macro did not initialize the sendpage operation in the proto\_ops structure
correctly. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a local
denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2692, Important)

* a flaw was found in the udp\_sendmsg() implementation in the Linux kernel

when using the MSG\_MORE flag on UDP sockets. A local, unprivileged user
could use this flaw to cause a local denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2009-2698, Important)

Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google
Security Team for responsibly reporting these flaws.

These updated packages also fix the following bug:

* in the dlm code, a socket was allocated in tcp\_connect\_to\_sock(), but was

not freed in the error exit path. This bug led to a memory leak and an
unresponsive system. A reported case of this bug occurred after running
"cman\_tool kill -n [nodename]". (BZ#515432)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-12 02:26:38 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Reported by Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes. The SOCKOPS_WRAP macro from include/linux/net.h doesn't initialise the sendpage operation in the proto_ops structure correctly. Leading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference, and thus a local privilege escalation.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team for responsibly reporting this flaw.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 00:25:48 UTC  ``` References: <http://blog.cr0.org/2009/08/linux-null-pointer-dereference-due-to.html> <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2009-08/0174.html> <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/36038/info> <http://www.centos.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=21740&forum=42> <http://www.linux-archive.org/centos/352108-kernel-null-pointer-vulnerability.html>  Upstream commit for 2.6: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/e694958388c50148389b0e9b9e9e8945cf0f1b98>  Upstream commit for 2.4: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.4.37.y.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=c18d0fe535a73b219f960d1af3d0c264555a12e3>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c10)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 05:47:26 UTC  ``` CVSS2 score of important, 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)  Note that the CVSS 'access vector' is set to AV:L as this is a vulnerability exploitable with only local access.  Mitigation: It is possible to mitigate this flaw by blacklisting the affected protocols. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of modules to blacklist, but this should prevent the publicly circulated exploit from working properly as this is the list of protocols (relevant to RHEL) known to be affected.  ** Ensure that the module is not already loaded, if not, these mitigation steps will not work.  ** We have used the 'install' command to direct the system to run '/bin/true' instead of actually inserting the kernel module if it is called.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the /etc/modules.conf file:  install bluez /bin/true  Note that the bluez module is from the kernel-unsupported package. If you do not have this package installed, then you do not have this module.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, add these entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install pppox /bin/true install bluetooth /bin/true install sctp /bin/true  Note that the sctp module cannot be unloaded in the running kernel if it is already loaded. You will need to make the changes in the /etc/modprobe.conf file and do a reboot.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise MRG, add these entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install pppox /bin/true install bluetooth /bin/true install appletalk /bin/true install ipx /bin/true install sctp /bin/true  Updated: Aug 17, 2009 20:45 EDT   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c11)  Christopher McCrory    2009-08-14 15:16:53 UTC  ``` re:  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install bluez /bin/true     I think that should be /etc/modules.conf   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c12)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 16:27:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c11)) > re: >  > ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the > /etc/modprobe.conf file: >  > install bluez /bin/true >  > I think that should be /etc/modules.conf    That's right.

Using GDB I was able to core dump the processes and found the web site from which they obtained the exploit code. I have copies of the exploit code if someone is interested.  They entered the system through a web application exploit and then used the exploit to gain a root shell.  I have applied the mitigation techniques above until a updated kernel is made available.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c30)  Jeremy West    2009-08-17 17:36:08 UTC  ``` Please note that Bugzilla is not an avenue for technical support.

One of the links from #5 has some sample exploit code which tried a whole bunch of different options to the socket call to see if any of them work.  BTW I'm puzzled that this bz is still marked as 'new' - surely it ought to have been confirmed and the proposed patches passed to engineering by now...

As I mentioned in [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c10), this is not an exhaustive list of modules to blacklist. On my test Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 machine, the sctp module does not load automatically when the reproducer is executed. But yes, I will include your suggestion to the existing mitigation steps.  > BTW I'm puzzled that this bz is still marked as 'new' - surely it ought to have > been confirmed and the proposed patches passed to engineering by now...

For every security bug, we have a top-level bug (this one) and several tracking bugs. The top-level bug is only used for tracking purposes, so the status for the top-level bug should not be taken as an indication for anything. Only the status of the tracking bugs matter.

If this is a critical remote exploitable vulnerability, we will give it the highest priority to release a kernel update that addresses the issue.  For this issue, it is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that can be mitigated. For customers who are unable to perform the mitigation steps, they can request for a hotfix (unofficial but supported kernel that has this fix until we are ready to release one) from Red Hat Support.

The problem is, that apache is also a local user, so any server running Apache with PHP, Perl (or any other scripting language) just became a huge risk.   Any PHP script (like your random badly programmed mambo/joomla module) which has a remote file include exploit, just became a very easy way into root access on almost every RHEL and Fedora server.  We've been upgrading 250 servers over the last 5 days with official .src.rpm's of the kernels with our own patched socket.c file in it, in that time we almost had 1 server compromised, so this exploit is certainly in the wild. 'Luckily' the server froze instead of dropping to a root shell.  - Jeroen Wunnink  (Sysadmin at a dutch webhosting company)   ```  [Comment 49](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c49)  Evan Stable    2009-08-21 16:02:49 UTC  ``` Not to mention the fact that Debian and Ubuntu have already released an updated kernel.

Debian and Ubuntu are both free distributions.    What's your point?  Fedora released their update as well.  RHEL's customers tend to be Enterprise users, and while we certainly expect any critical vulnerabilities to be fixed in a timely manner, we also expect thorough testing and QA to be done on any release so as not to interrupt our environments.  This is why we use RHEL and not a "free" distribution. :-)  In any case, this probably isn't the place for this discussion to happen.  If you want the patched kernel faster, get a hotfix from Support and push it out.   ```  [Comment 51](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c51)  Taco Scargo    2009-08-23 08:03:30 UTC  ``` A simple but very needed patch like this should be able to be tested and out to customers as fast as lightning. In my eyes this issue leaves competitors and bashers of Red Hat all the room they would need. I myself am very disappointed in the way that Red Hat addresses this vulnerability.  @Ray Van Dolson: Enterprise customers pay Red Hat to provide a patch instead of needing to create one themselves or rely on the community. I agree that Red Hat's customers expect a tested and Q&A'd kernel release. But due to the severity and exploitability of this flaw, combined with the relative simple fix, should not cause customers to have to wait (more than) two weeks for an updated kernel to be released to customers.  Added to this Red Hat is relatively silent on the ETA of their fixed kernel.   ```  [Comment 52](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c52)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-24 08:12:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1222 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1222.html>   ```  [Comment 53](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c53)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-24 08:29:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1223 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1223.html>   ```  [Comment 54](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c54)  Andrew C Aitchison    2009-08-24 09:09:34 UTC  ``` Ah.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-12 02:26:38 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Reported by Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes. The SOCKOPS_WRAP macro from include/linux/net.h doesn't initialise the sendpage operation in the proto_ops structure correctly. Leading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference, and thus a local privilege escalation.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team for responsibly reporting this flaw.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 00:25:48 UTC  ``` References: <http://blog.cr0.org/2009/08/linux-null-pointer-dereference-due-to.html> <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2009-08/0174.html> <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/36038/info> <http://www.centos.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=21740&forum=42> <http://www.linux-archive.org/centos/352108-kernel-null-pointer-vulnerability.html>  Upstream commit for 2.6: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/e694958388c50148389b0e9b9e9e8945cf0f1b98>  Upstream commit for 2.4: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.4.37.y.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=c18d0fe535a73b219f960d1af3d0c264555a12e3>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c10)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 05:47:26 UTC  ``` CVSS2 score of important, 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)  Note that the CVSS 'access vector' is set to AV:L as this is a vulnerability exploitable with only local access.  Mitigation: It is possible to mitigate this flaw by blacklisting the affected protocols. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of modules to blacklist, but this should prevent the publicly circulated exploit from working properly as this is the list of protocols (relevant to RHEL) known to be affected.  ** Ensure that the module is not already loaded, if not, these mitigation steps will not work.  ** We have used the 'install' command to direct the system to run '/bin/true' instead of actually inserting the kernel module if it is called.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the /etc/modules.conf file:  install bluez /bin/true  Note that the bluez module is from the kernel-unsupported package. If you do not have this package installed, then you do not have this module.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, add these entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install pppox /bin/true install bluetooth /bin/true install sctp /bin/true  Note that the sctp module cannot be unloaded in the running kernel if it is already loaded. You will need to make the changes in the /etc/modprobe.conf file and do a reboot.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise MRG, add these entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install pppox /bin/true install bluetooth /bin/true install appletalk /bin/true install ipx /bin/true install sctp /bin/true  Updated: Aug 17, 2009 20:45 EDT   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c11)  Christopher McCrory    2009-08-14 15:16:53 UTC  ``` re:  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install bluez /bin/true     I think that should be /etc/modules.conf   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c12)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 16:27:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c11)) > re: >  > ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the > /etc/modprobe.conf file: >  > install bluez /bin/true >  > I think that should be /etc/modules.conf    That's right.

Using GDB I was able to core dump the processes and found the web site from which they obtained the exploit code. I have copies of the exploit code if someone is interested.  They entered the system through a web application exploit and then used the exploit to gain a root shell.  I have applied the mitigation techniques above until a updated kernel is made available.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c30)  Jeremy West    2009-08-17 17:36:08 UTC  ``` Please note that Bugzilla is not an avenue for technical support.

One of the links from #5 has some sample exploit code which tried a whole bunch of different options to the socket call to see if any of them work.  BTW I'm puzzled that this bz is still marked as 'new' - surely it ought to have been confirmed and the proposed patches passed to engineering by now...  Maybe that the bug is only regarded as 'important' (well in #10 it is), means that we will have to wait for the next regular kernel update for this to be fixed.   -- Jon   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c34)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-18 00:42:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #32](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c32)) > I think that the point of #24 and probably #27 is that the suggested workround > for RHEL4/5 does _not_ close all the possible ways to exploit this exploit, ie > adding just: >  >   install pppox /bin/true >   install bluetooth /bin/true >  > will (for example) still allow code using PF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_SCTP > to exploit the hole if ipv6 and sctp are available.  As I mentioned in [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c10), this is not an exhaustive list of modules to blacklist. On my test Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 machine, the sctp module does not load automatically when the reproducer is executed. But yes, I will include your suggestion to the existing mitigation steps.  > BTW I'm puzzled that this bz is still marked as 'new' - surely it ought to have > been confirmed and the proposed patches passed to engineering by now...

For every security bug, we have a top-level bug (this one) and several tracking bugs. The top-level bug is only used for tracking purposes, so the status for the top-level bug should not be taken as an indication for anything. Only the status of the tracking bugs matter.

Over a week from a published exploit *and* an upstream fix to release a kernel is not good.

If this is a critical remote exploitable vulnerability, we will give it the highest priority to release a kernel update that addresses the issue.

The problem is, that apache is also a local user, so any server running Apache with PHP, Perl (or any other scripting language) just became a huge risk.   Any PHP script (like your random badly programmed mambo/joomla module) which has a remote file include exploit, just became a very easy way into root access on almost every RHEL and Fedora server.  We've been upgrading 250 servers over the last 5 days with official .src.rpm's of the kernels with our own patched socket.c file in it, in that time we almost had 1 server compromised, so this exploit is certainly in the wild. 'Luckily' the server froze instead of dropping to a root shell.  - Jeroen Wunnink  (Sysadmin at a dutch webhosting company)   ```  [Comment 49](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c49)  Evan Stable    2009-08-21 16:02:49 UTC  ``` Not to mention the fact that Debian and Ubuntu have already released an updated kernel.

Debian and Ubuntu are both free distributions.    What's your point?  Fedora released their update as well.  RHEL's customers tend to be Enterprise users, and while we certainly expect any critical vulnerabilities to be fixed in a timely manner, we also expect thorough testing and QA to be done on any release so as not to interrupt our environments.  This is why we use RHEL and not a "free" distribution. :-)  In any case, this probably isn't the place for this discussion to happen.  If you want the patched kernel faster, get a hotfix from Support and push it out.   ```  [Comment 51](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c51)  Taco Scargo    2009-08-23 08:03:30 UTC  ``` A simple but very needed patch like this should be able to be tested and out to customers as fast as lightning. In my eyes this issue leaves competitors and bashers of Red Hat all the room they would need. I myself am very disappointed in the way that Red Hat addresses this vulnerability.  @Ray Van Dolson: Enterprise customers pay Red Hat to provide a patch instead of needing to create one themselves or rely on the community. I agree that Red Hat's customers expect a tested and Q&A'd kernel release. But due to the severity and exploitability of this flaw, combined with the relative simple fix, should not cause customers to have to wait (more than) two weeks for an updated kernel to be released to customers.  Added to this Red Hat is relatively silent on the ETA of their fixed kernel.   ```  [Comment 52](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c52)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-24 08:12:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1222 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1222.html>   ```  [Comment 53](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c53)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-24 08:29:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1223 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1223.html>   ```  [Comment 54](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c54)  Andrew C Aitchison    2009-08-24 09:09:34 UTC  ``` Ah.

Package        : linux-2.6
Vulnerability  : denial of service/privilege escalation
Problem type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1385 CVE-2009-1389 CVE-2009-1630 CVE-2009-1633
                 CVE-2009-2692

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2009-1385

    Neil Horman discovered a missing fix from the e1000 network
    driver.  A remote user may cause a denial of service by way of a
    kernel panic triggered by specially crafted frame sizes.

CVE-2009-1389

    Michael Tokarev discovered an issue in the r8169 network driver.
    Remote users on the same LAN may cause a denial of service by way
    of a kernel panic triggered by receiving a large size frame.

CVE-2009-1630

    Frank Filz discovered that local users may be able to execute
    files without execute permission when accessed via an nfs4 mount.

CVE-2009-1633

    Jeff Layton and Suresh Jayaraman fixed several buffer overflows in
    the CIFS filesystem which allow remote servers to cause memory
    corruption.

CVE-2009-2692

    Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes discovered an issue with how the
    sendpage function is initialized in the proto_ops structure.
    Local users can exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated
    privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.18.dfsg.1-24etch3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and
user-mode-linux packages.

Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatability with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 4.0 (etch)
     fai-kernels                             1.17+etch.24etch3
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.18-1um-2etch.24etch3

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch
- -------------------------------

Oldstable updates are available for alpha, amd64, hppa, i386, ia64, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.
Updates for arm and mips will be released as they become available.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-12 02:26:38 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Reported by Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes. The SOCKOPS_WRAP macro from include/linux/net.h doesn't initialise the sendpage operation in the proto_ops structure correctly. Leading to a kernel NULL pointer dereference, and thus a local privilege escalation.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes of the Google Security Team for responsibly reporting this flaw.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 00:25:48 UTC  ``` References: <http://blog.cr0.org/2009/08/linux-null-pointer-dereference-due-to.html> <http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2009-08/0174.html> <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/36038/info> <http://www.centos.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=21740&forum=42> <http://www.linux-archive.org/centos/352108-kernel-null-pointer-vulnerability.html>  Upstream commit for 2.6: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/e694958388c50148389b0e9b9e9e8945cf0f1b98>  Upstream commit for 2.4: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.4.37.y.git;a=commitdiff_plain;h=c18d0fe535a73b219f960d1af3d0c264555a12e3>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c10)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 05:47:26 UTC  ``` CVSS2 score of important, 7.2 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)  Note that the CVSS 'access vector' is set to AV:L as this is a vulnerability exploitable with only local access.  Mitigation: It is possible to mitigate this flaw by blacklisting the affected protocols. Note that this is not an exhaustive list of modules to blacklist, but this should prevent the publicly circulated exploit from working properly as this is the list of protocols (relevant to RHEL) known to be affected.  ** Ensure that the module is not already loaded, if not, these mitigation steps will not work.  ** We have used the 'install' command to direct the system to run '/bin/true' instead of actually inserting the kernel module if it is called.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the /etc/modules.conf file:  install bluez /bin/true  Note that the bluez module is from the kernel-unsupported package. If you do not have this package installed, then you do not have this module.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, add these entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install pppox /bin/true install bluetooth /bin/true install sctp /bin/true  Note that the sctp module cannot be unloaded in the running kernel if it is already loaded. You will need to make the changes in the /etc/modprobe.conf file and do a reboot.  ** On Red Hat Enterprise MRG, add these entries to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install pppox /bin/true install bluetooth /bin/true install appletalk /bin/true install ipx /bin/true install sctp /bin/true  Updated: Aug 17, 2009 20:45 EDT   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c11)  Christopher McCrory    2009-08-14 15:16:53 UTC  ``` re:  ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the /etc/modprobe.conf file:  install bluez /bin/true     I think that should be /etc/modules.conf   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c12)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-14 16:27:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c11)) > re: >  > ** On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, add this entry to the end of the > /etc/modprobe.conf file: >  > install bluez /bin/true >  > I think that should be /etc/modules.conf    That's right.

The affected module includes PF_APPLETALK, PF_IPX,   PF_IRDA, PF_X25 and PF_AX25 families.  - Initializations were missing in other protocols, including PF_BLUETOOTH,   PF_IUCV, PF_INET6 (with IPPROTO_SCTP), PF_PPPOX and PF_ISDN.

Using GDB I was able to core dump the processes and found the web site from which they obtained the exploit code. I have copies of the exploit code if someone is interested.  They entered the system through a web application exploit and then used the exploit to gain a root shell.  I have applied the mitigation techniques above until a updated kernel is made available.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c30)  Jeremy West    2009-08-17 17:36:08 UTC  ``` Please note that Bugzilla is not an avenue for technical support.

One of the links from #5 has some sample exploit code which tried a whole bunch of different options to the socket call to see if any of them work.  BTW I'm puzzled that this bz is still marked as 'new' - surely it ought to have been confirmed and the proposed patches passed to engineering by now...  Maybe that the bug is only regarded as 'important' (well in #10 it is), means that we will have to wait for the next regular kernel update for this to be fixed.   -- Jon   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c34)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-18 00:42:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #32](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c32)) > I think that the point of #24 and probably #27 is that the suggested workround > for RHEL4/5 does _not_ close all the possible ways to exploit this exploit, ie > adding just: >  >   install pppox /bin/true >   install bluetooth /bin/true >  > will (for example) still allow code using PF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_SCTP > to exploit the hole if ipv6 and sctp are available.  As I mentioned in [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c10), this is not an exhaustive list of modules to blacklist. On my test Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 machine, the sctp module does not load automatically when the reproducer is executed. But yes, I will include your suggestion to the existing mitigation steps.  > BTW I'm puzzled that this bz is still marked as 'new' - surely it ought to have > been confirmed and the proposed patches passed to engineering by now...  Maybe > that the bug is only regarded as 'important' (well in #10 it is), means that we > will have to wait for the next regular kernel update for this to be fixed.  For every security bug, we have a top-level bug (this one) and several tracking bugs. The top-level bug is only used for tracking purposes, so the status for the top-level bug should not be taken as an indication for anything. Only the status of the tracking bugs matter.

Over a week from a published exploit *and* an upstream fix to release a kernel is not good.

Over a week from a published exploit > *and* an upstream fix to release a kernel is not good.  If this is a critical remote exploitable vulnerability, we will give it the highest priority to release a kernel update that addresses the issue.  For this issue, it is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that can be mitigated. For customers who are unable to perform the mitigation steps, they can request for a hotfix (unofficial but supported kernel that has this fix until we are ready to release one) from Red Hat Support.  If you have any questions, feel free to email us directly at secalert. We respond very quickly ;)  > I don't have access to the tracking bugs, so there may be a good reason,  Please see [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c34](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c34 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-2692 kernel: uninit op in SOCKOPS_WRAP() leads to privesc")  Thanks, Eugene   ```  [Comment 48](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c48)  Jeroen Wunnink    2009-08-21 14:13:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #47](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c47)) >  > If this is a critical remote exploitable vulnerability, we will give it the > highest priority to release a kernel update that addresses the issue. >  > For this issue, it is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that can be > mitigated.

The problem is, that apache is also a local user, so any server running Apache with PHP, Perl (or any other scripting language) just became a huge risk.   Any PHP script (like your random badly programmed mambo/joomla module) which has a remote file include exploit, just became a very easy way into root access on almost every RHEL and Fedora server.  We've been upgrading 250 servers over the last 5 days with official .src.rpm's of the kernels with our own patched socket.c file in it, in that time we almost had 1 server compromised, so this exploit is certainly in the wild. 'Luckily' the server froze instead of dropping to a root shell.  - Jeroen Wunnink  (Sysadmin at a dutch webhosting company)   ```  [Comment 49](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c49)  Evan Stable    2009-08-21 16:02:49 UTC  ``` Not to mention the fact that Debian and Ubuntu have already released an updated kernel.  Debian and Ubuntu are both free distributions.   ```  [Comment 50](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c50)  Ray Van Dolson    2009-08-21 16:10:46 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #49](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c49)) > Not to mention the fact that Debian and Ubuntu have already released an updated > kernel.  Debian and Ubuntu are both free distributions.    What's your point?  Fedora released their update as well.  RHEL's customers tend to be Enterprise users, and while we certainly expect any critical vulnerabilities to be fixed in a timely manner, we also expect thorough testing and QA to be done on any release so as not to interrupt our environments.  This is why we use RHEL and not a "free" distribution. :-)  In any case, this probably isn't the place for this discussion to happen.  If you want the patched kernel faster, get a hotfix from Support and push it out.   ```  [Comment 51](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c51)  Taco Scargo    2009-08-23 08:03:30 UTC  ``` A simple but very needed patch like this should be able to be tested and out to customers as fast as lightning. In my eyes this issue leaves competitors and bashers of Red Hat all the room they would need. I myself am very disappointed in the way that Red Hat addresses this vulnerability.  @Ray Van Dolson: Enterprise customers pay Red Hat to provide a patch instead of needing to create one themselves or rely on the community. I agree that Red Hat's customers expect a tested and Q&A'd kernel release. But due to the severity and exploitability of this flaw, combined with the relative simple fix, should not cause customers to have to wait (more than) two weeks for an updated kernel to be released to customers.  Added to this Red Hat is relatively silent on the ETA of their fixed kernel.   ```  [Comment 52](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c52)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-24 08:12:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1222 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1222.html>   ```  [Comment 53](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c53)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-24 08:29:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1223 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1223.html>   ```  [Comment 54](show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c54)  Andrew C Aitchison    2009-08-24 09:09:34 UTC  ``` Ah.

### [A few thoughts on Fuchsia security](https://blog.cr0.org/2021/06/a-few-thoughts-on-fuchsia-security.html)

I want to say a few words about my current adventure. I joined the [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev) project at its inception and worked on the daunting task of building and shipping a brand new open-source operating system.

As my colleague [Chris noted](https://twitter.com/chrismckillop/status/1403494700925939714), pointing to [this comparison](https://9to5google.com/2021/06/11/google-nest-hub-fuchsia-video-comparison/) of a device running a Linux-based OS vs Fuchsia, making Fuchsia invisible was not an easy feat.

Of course, under the hood, a lot is different. We built a brand new message-passing kernel, new connectivity stacks, component model, file-systems, you name it. And yes, there are a few security things I'm excited about.

**Message-passing and capabilities**

I wrote a few posts on this blog about the sandboxing technologies a few of us were building in Chrome/ChromeOS at the time. A while back, the situation was [challenging on Linux](https://blog.cr0.org/2009/10/security-in-depth-for-linux-software.html) to say the least. We had to build a special a setuid binary to sandbox Chrome and [seccomp-bpf](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.16/userspace-api/seccomp_filter.html) was essentially created to improve the state of sandboxing on ChromeOS, and Linux generally.

With lots of work, we got into a point where the Chrome renderer sandbox was \*very\* tight in respect to the rest of the system [[initial announcement](https://blog.chromium.org/2012/11/a-safer-playground-for-your-linux-and.html)]. Most of the remaining attack surface was in IPC interfaces and the remaining available system interfaces were as essential as it could get on Linux.

A hard problem in particular was to make sure that existing code, not written with sandboxing in mind, would "just" work under a very tight sandbox (I'm talking about zero file-system access - chroot-ed into an empty, deleted directory -, different namespaces, a small subset of syscalls available, etc.). One had to allow for "hooking" into some of the system calls that we would deny, so that we could dynamically rewrite them into IPCs (this is why the SIGSYS mechanism of seccomp was built). It was hard, and I dare say, pretty messy.

On Fuchsia, we have solved many of those issues. Sandboxing is trivial. In fact a new process with access to no capabilities [can do exceedingly little](https://twitter.com/adambarth/status/1398308060313968644) ([also see David Kaplan's exploration](https://www.depletionmode.com/zircon-process.html)). [FIDL](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/languages/fidl), our IPC system, is a joy. I often smile when debating designs, because whether or not something is in-process or out-of-process can sometimes feel like a small implementation detail to people.

**Verified execution**

We will eventually write some good documentation about this. I believe that we have meaningfully expanded on [ChromeOS' verified boot design](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/verified-boot).

The gist is that we store immutable code and data on a content-addressed file-system called [BlobFS](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/filesystems/blobfs). You access what you want by specifying its hash (really, the root of a Merkle tree, for fast random access). Then we have an abstraction layer on top, which components can use to access files by names and which, under the hood can verify signatures for those hashes. File-systems are of course in user-land, can layer nicely, and [it's easy to create the right environment](https://mobile.twitter.com/adambarth/status/1400126939340296194) for any component.

A key element is that we have made the ability to create executable pages a real permission, without disturbing the loading of BlobFS-backed, signed, dynamic libraries. For any process which doesn't need a JIT, it'll force attackers to ROP/JOP their way to the next stage of their attack.

**Rust**

For system-level folks, [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is one of the most exciting security developments of the past few decades. It elegantly solves problems which smart people were saying could not be solved. Fuchsia has a lot of code, and we made sure that much of it (millions of LoC) was in Rust.

Our kernel, [Zircon, is not in Rust](https://twitter.com/cpuGoogle/status/1397265884251525122). Not yet anyway. But it is in a [nice, lean subset of C++](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/development/languages/c-cpp/cxx) which I consider a vast improvement over C.

**Various**

* [Kostya](https://twitter.com/crypt0ad) wrote [a security-minded memory allocator, Scudo](https://llvm.org/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.html), which has been one of his contributions to Fuchsia (and also now to [Android](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/scudo)!)
* We took the opportunity to have a [proper PRNG interface](https://twitter.com/adambarth/status/1397586940841533446). It's backed by [D.J. Bernstein](https://twitter.com/hashbreaker)'s excellent [ChaCha20](https://cr.yp.to/chacha.html) with seeding from hardware (and [JitterEntropy](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/system/jitterentropy/config-basic) for security in depth); hardware-backed AES-CTR is too slow because of the context saving/restoring.
* Lots of [fuzzing](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/testing/fuzz_testing) and [sanitizers](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/testing/sanitizers) of course. In particular, we adapted [Dmitry](https://twitter.com/dvyukov)'s [SyzKaller](https://github.com/google/syzkaller) to work on Zircon.
* Your favorite exploit mitigations where they make sense, including [SafeStack](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/%2B/refs/heads/main/docs/concepts/kernel/safestack.md), [ShadowCallStack](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/%2B/refs/heads/main/docs/concepts/kernel/shadow_call_stack.md) and ASLR.
* Enforcement that system calls [go through our vDSO](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel/vdso#enforcement) and the potential for [vDSO variants](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel/vdso#variants).

There is much more, which I may get to at some point. And there is a lot more to do. I am optimistic that we have created a sensible security foundation to iterate on. Time will tell. What did we miss? Fuchsia is covered by the [Google VRP](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/), so you can get payed by [telling us](https://bugs.fuchsia.dev/p/fuchsia/issues/entry?template=Fuchsia+Security+external+bug+report)!

### [Introducing Chrome's next-generation Linux sandbox](https://blog.cr0.org/2012/09/introducing-chromes-next-generation.html)

Starting with Chrome 23.0.1255.0, recently released to the [Dev Channel](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel#TOC-Linux), you will see Chrome making use of our next-generation sandbox on Linux and ChromeOS for renderers.

**We are using a new facility, introduced in Linux 3.5 and developed by Will Drewry called [Seccomp-BPF](http://lwn.net/Articles/475043/).**

**Seccomp-BPF builds on the ability** **to send small BPF (for [BSD Packet Filter](http://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf)) [programs](http://www.unix.com/man-page/FreeBSD/4/bpf/) that can be interpreted by the kernel. This feature was originally designed for tcpdump, so that filters could directly run in the kernel for performance reasons.**

**BPF programs are untrusted by the kernel, so they are limited in a number of ways. Most notably, they can't have loops, which****bounds their execution time by a monotonic function of their size and** **allows the kernel to know they will always terminate.**

**With Seccomp-BPF, BPF programs can now be used to evaluate system call numbers and their parameters.**

**This is a huge change for sandboxing code in Linux, which, as you may recall, has been very limited in this area. It's also a change that recognizes and innovates in two important dimensions of sandboxing:**

* **Mandatory access control versus "discretionary privilege dropping". Something I always felt strongly about and [have discussed before](http://blog.cr0.org/2009/10/security-in-depth-for-linux-software.html).**
* Access control semantics, versus attack surface reduction.

Let's talk about the second topic. Having a nice, high level, access control semantics is appealing and, one may argue, necessary. When you're designing a sandbox for your application, you may want to say things such as:

* I want this process to have access to this subset of the file system.
* I want this process to be able to allocate or de-allocate memory.
* I want this process to be able to interfere (debug, send signals) with this set of processes.

The capabilities-oriented framework [Capsicum](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/) takes such an approach. This is very useful.

However, with such an approach it's difficult to assess the kernel's attack surface. When the whole kernel is in your [trusted computing base](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base) "you're going to have a bad time", as a colleague recently put it.

**Now, in that same dimension, at the other end of the spectrum, is the "attack surface reduction" oriented approach. The approach where you're close to the ugly guts of implementation details, the one taken by Seccomp-BPF.**

**In that approach, read()+write() and vmsplice() are completely different beasts, because you're not looking at their semantics, but at the attack surface they open in the kernel. They perform similar things, but perhaps [ihaquer](http://www.isec.pl/) will have a harder time exploiting read()/write() on pipes than vmsplice(). Semantically, uselib() seems to be a subset of open() + mmap(), but similarly, the attack surface is different.**

**The drawback of course is that implementing particular sandbox semantics with such a mechanism looks ugly. For instance, let's say you want to allow opening any file in /public from within the sandbox, how would you implement that in seccomp-BPF?**

**Well, first you need to understand what set of system calls would be concerned by such an operation. That's not just open(), but also openat() (an ugly implementation-level detail, some libc will happily use openat() with AT\_FDCWD instead of open(). Then you realize that a BPF program in the kernel will only see a pointer to the file name, so you can't filter on that (even if you could dereference pointers in BPF programs, it wouldn't be safe to do so, because an attacker could create another thread that would modify the file name after it was evaluated by the BPF program, so the kernel would also need to copy it in a safe location).**

**In the end, what you need to do is have a trusted helper process (or broker) that runs unsandboxed for this particular set of system calls and have it accept requests to open files over an IPC channel, have it make the security decision and send the file descriptor back over an IPC.**

**(If you're interested in that sort of approach, pushed to the extreme, look at Markus Gutschke's [original seccomp mode 1 sandbox](http://code.google.com/p/seccompsandbox/).)**

**That's tedious but doable. In comparison, Capsicum would make this a breeze.**

**There are other issues with such a low-level approach. By filtering system calls, you're breaking the kernel API. This means that third party code (such as libraries) you include in your address space can break. For this reason, I suggested to Will to implement an "exception" mechanism through signals, so that special handlers can be called when system calls are denied. Such handlers are now used and can for instance "broker out" system calls such as open().**

In my opinion, the Capsicum and Seccomp-BPF approach are trade-offs, each on the other end of the spectrum. Having both would be great. We could stack one on top of the other and have the best of both worlds.

In a similar, but very limited, fashion, this is what we have now in Chrome: we stacked the seccomp-bpf sandbox on top of the [setuid sandbox](http://code.google.com/p/setuid-sandbox/). The setuid sandbox gives a few easy to understand semantic properties: no file system access, no process access outside of the sandbox, no network access. It makes it much easier to layer a seccomp-bpf sandbox on top.

Several people besides myself have worked on making this possible. In particular: Chris Evans, Jorge Lucangeli Obes, Markus Gutschke, Adam Langley (and others who made Chrome sandboxable under the setuid sandbox in the first place) and of course, for the actual kernel support, Will Drewry and Kees Cook.

We will continue to work on improving and tightening this new sandbox, this is just a start. Please give it a try, and report any bugs to crbug.com (feel free to cc: jln at chromium.org directly).

PS: to make sure that you have kernel support for seccomp BPF, use Linux 3.5 or Ubuntu 12.04. Check about:sandbox in Chrome 22+ and see if Seccomp-BPF is enabled). Also make sure you're using the 64 bits version of Chrome.

### [Javocalypse](https://blog.cr0.org/2010/04/javacalypse.html)

EDIT: Following its full disclosure [Sun fixed](http://blogs.oracle.com/security/2010/04/security_alert_for_cve-2010-08.html) Tavis' Java deployment toolkit bug (CVE-2010-0886 and CVE-2010-0887) in a matter of days, wow! No doubts this will be used in the future as an argument for full disclosure.

However, this does not bring much security! An attacker can still automatically downgrade your version of Java ([using installJRE](http://twitter.com/taviso/status/11900526653)) and exploit this bug or any other he likes!

[Almost one year ago, I blogged](http://blog.cr0.org/2009/05/write-once-own-everyone.html) about one of my favorite security bug, found by [Sami Koivu](http://slightlyrandombrokenthoughts.blogspot.com/).

More specifically, I blogged about a class of Java bugs exposed by Sami Koivu and I mentioned this was the first instance of it.

Not only was it interesting from a technical perspective, but also high impact, allowing perfectly reliable (and relatively simple) cross platform exploitation of any system supporting Java applets (and that's a lot of systems). And this, through a widely deployed, but notoriously poorly updated component.

One year later [1], Sami strikes again. This time should be the final nail in Java applets' coffin for anyone with security expectations:

* Another instance of the privileged deserialization class of bugs ([CVE-2010-0094](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-051/))
* A new class of bugs: [Java trusted method chaining](http://slightlyrandombrokenthoughts.blogspot.com/2010/04/java-trusted-method-chaining-cve-2010.html). With one instance as a free sample ([CVE-2010-0840](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-056/)). (This one is beautful by the way, be sure to read!)
* Free goodies for web security researchers: a flaw that completely breaks the web security model. The "[Java-SOP](http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_Java)" security was done in the compiler, not the runtime ([CVE-2010-0095](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-055/)). Normally this would translate to "really bad", but why would one need your cookies when one can have your computer?

But Tavis would not let Sami have his party alone and between two kernel bugs took a quick look at the Java deployment toolkit and found this [embarrassingly trivially exploitable issue](http://www.mail-archive.com/full-disclosure%40lists.grok.org.uk/msg40571.html). It's not corrected yet. And it's exploitable even if you have Java disabled in IE or Firefox, you only need to have Java installed.

It's so simple that it was obvious that many people had found (and were exploiting) this one. And we've already had confirmation of this, which led Tavis to release his advisory with mitigation instructions before a patch was available. Read his advisory for interesting thoughts on disclosure.

So, dear reader, if you don't want to get owned multiple times:

* Disable Java in your web browsers
* Uninstall Java completely or follow Tavis' mitigation instructions on Windows

Updating Java does not work, Sami has already mentioned that he would be very surprised if there weren't 10 other cases of "Java trusted method chaining" bugs. There are probably other deserialization ones too.

And anyway, a lazy attacker can just [silently downgrade his up-to date target](http://twitter.com/taviso/status/11900526653) to whatever vulnerable Java version he wants to exploit, using the aforementioned Java deployment toolkit. Really, it's a feature.

Moreover, not everyone can update Java. Let's see how long it takes for Apple to patch these ones this time. My bet is that up-to-date default MacOS X installations are going to be vulnerable for a while to even the publicly reported bugs.

This is Javocalypse.

[1] well technically, only a few months later, but it took 5 months before the public advisory. A delay that I would call "reasonable".

### [There's a party at Ring0, and you're invited](https://blog.cr0.org/2010/03/theres-party-at-ring0-and-youre-invited.html)

Tavis and I have just come back from [CanSecWest](http://www.cansecwest.com). The title of our talk was "There's a party at Ring0, and you're invited".

We went through some of the bugs that we have worked on this past year and mentioned some of our thoughts on kernel security in general:

* We see an increasing attack surface, both locally and remotely (@font-face, [webgl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL)...)
* The recent focus on sandboxes ([Chrome](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/sandbox), [Office](http://blogs.technet.com/office2010/archive/2009/08/13/protected-view-in-office-2010.aspx)) makes the kernel an even more interesting target
* Modern operating systems still generally lack facilities for discretionary privilege dropping or to reduce the kernel's attack surface (with the notable exception of [SECCOMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp) on Linux)
* While most OS have some degree of userland memory corruption exploitation prevention, kernel exploitation prevention is immature. On Linux, [PaX/grsecurity](http://www.grsecurity.net/) leads the effort and Microsoft added [safe unlinking](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/05/26/safe-unlinking-in-the-kernel-pool.aspx) in the Windows 7 kernel.

### [CVE-2010-0232: Microsoft Windows NT #GP Trap Handler Allows Users to Switch Kernel Stack](https://blog.cr0.org/2010/01/cve-2010-0232-microsoft-windows-nt-gp.html)

Two days ago, Tavis Ormandy [has published](http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2010-January/072549.html) one of the most interesting vulnerabilities I've seen so far.

It's one of those rare, but fascinating design-level errors dealing with low-level system internals. Its exploitation requires skills and ingenuity.

The vulnerability lies in Windows' support for Intel's hardware 8086 emulation support (virtual-8086, or VM86) and is believed to have been there since Windows NT 3.1 (1993!), making it 17 years old.

It uses two tricks that we have already published on this blog before, the [#GP on pre-commit handling failure](http://blog.cr0.org/2009/09/cve-2009-2793-iret-gp-on-pre-commit.html) and the [forging of cs:eip in VM86 mode](http://blog.cr0.org/2009/10/cve-2009-2267-mishandled-exception-on.html).

This was intended to be mentioned in our talk at PacSec about virtualization this past November, but Tavis had agreed with Microsoft to postpone the release of this advisory.

Tavis was kind enough to write a blog post about it, you can read it below:

***From Tavis Ormandy:***

I've just published one of the most interesting bugs I've ever encountered, a simple authentication check in Windows NT that can incorrectly let users take control of the system. The bug exists in code hidden deep enough inside the kernel that it's gone unnoticed for as long as NT has existed.

If you've ever tried to run an MS-DOS or Win16 application on a modern NT machine, the chances are it worked. This is an impressive feat, these applications were written for a completely different execution environment and operating system, and yet still work today and run at almost native speed.

The secret that makes this possible behind the scenes is Virtual-8086 mode. Virtual-8086 mode is a hardware emulation facility built into all x86 processors since the i386, and allows modern operating systems to run 16-bit programs designed for real mode with very little overhead. These 16-bit programs run in a simulated real mode environment within a regular protected mode task, allowing them to co-exist in a modern multitasking environment.

Support for Virtual-8086 mode requires a monitor, the collective name for the software that handles any requests the program makes. These requests range from handling sensitive instructions to mapping low-level services onto system calls and are implemented partially in kernel mode and partially in user mode.

In Windows NT, the user mode component is called the NTVDM subsystem, and it interacts with the kernel via a native system service called NtVdmControl. NtVdmControl is unusual because it's authenticated, only authorised programs are permitted to access it, which is enforced using a special process flag called VdmAllowed which the kernel verifies is present before NtVdmControl will perform any action; if you don't have this flag, the kernel will always return STATUS\_ACCESS\_DENIED.

The bug we're talking about today involves how BIOS service calls are handled, which are a low level way of interacting with the system that's needed to support real-mode programs. The kernel implements BIOS service calls in two stages, the second stage begins when the interrupt handler for general protection faults (often shortened to #GP in technical documents) detects that the system has completed the first stage.

The details of how BIOS service calls are implemented are unimportant, what is important is that the two stages must be perfectly synchronised, if the kernel transitions to the second stage incorrectly, a hostile user can take advantage of this confusion to take control of the kernel and compromise the system. In theory, this shouldn't be a problem, Microsoft implemented a check that verifies that the trap occurred at a magic address (actually, a cs:eip pair) that unprivileged users can't reach.

The check seems reasonable at first, the hardware guarantees that unprivileged code can't arbitrarily make itself more privileged without a special request, and even if it could, only authorised programs are permitted to use NtVdmControl() anyway.

Unfortunately, it turns out these assumptions were wrong. The problem I noticed was that although unprivileged code cannot make itself more privileged arbitrarily, Virtual-8086 mode makes testing the privilege level of code more difficult because the segment registers lose their special meaning. This is because In protected mode, the segment registers (particularly ss and cs) can be used to test privilege level, however in Virtual-8086 mode they're used to create far pointers, which allow 16-bit programs to access the 20-bit real address space.

However, I still couldn't abuse this fact because NtVdmControl() can only be accessed by authorised programs, and there's no other way to request pathological operation on Virtual-8086 mode tasks. I was able to solve this problem by invoking the real NTVDM subsystem, and then loading my own code inside it using a combination of CreateRemoteThread(), VirtualAllocEx() and WriteProcessMemory().

Finally, I needed to find a way to force the kernel to transition to the vulnerable code while my process appeared to be privileged. My solution to this was to make the kernel fault when returning to user mode from kernel mode, thus creating the appearance of a legitimate trap for the fabricated execution context that I had installed. These steps all fit together perfectly, and can be used to convince the kernel to execute my code, giving me complete control of the system.

**Conclusion**

Could Microsoft have avoided this issue? It's difficult to imagine how, errors like this will generally elude fuzz testing (In order to observe any problem, a fuzzer would need to guess a 46-bit magic number, as well as setup an intricate process state, not to mention the VdmAllowed flag), and any static analysis would need an incredibly accurate model of the Intel architecture.

The code itself was probably resistant to manual audit, it's remained fairly static throughout the history of NT, and is likely considered forgotten lore even inside Microsoft. In cases like this, security researchers are sometimes in a better position than those with the benefit of documentation and source code, all abstraction is stripped away and we can study what remains without being tainted by how documentation claims something is supposed to work.

If you want to mitigate future problems like this, reducing attack surface is always the key to security. In this particular case, you can use group policy to disable support for Application Compatibility (see the Application Compatability policy template) which will prevent unprivileged users from accessing NtVdmControl(), certainly a wise move if your users don't need MS-DOS or Windows 3.1 applications.

### [Virtualization security and the Intel privilege model](https://blog.cr0.org/2009/11/virtualisation-security-and-intel.html)

Earlier this month, Tavis and I spoke at [PacSec 2009](http://www.pacsec.jp/) in Tokyo about virtualisation security on Intel architectures, with a focus on CPU virtualisation.

During this talk, we briefly explained various techniques used for CPU virtualisation such as dynamic translation (QEmu), VMware-style binary translation or paravirtualisation (Xen) and we went through bugs found by us and others:

- We released some details about [MS09-33](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS09-033.mspx) (CVE-2009-1542), a bug we found in VirtualPC's instructions decoding
- We mentioned two of the [awesome bugs found by Derek Soeder](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/498150) in VMware, CVE-2008-4915 and CVE-2008-4279
- We explained and demo-ed the exploitation of the mishandled exception on page fault bug in VMware that I [previously blogged about](http://blog.cr0.org/2009/10/cve-2009-2267-mishandled-exception-on.html).
- We released information on CVE-2009-3827, a bug we discovered in Virtual PC's hardware virtualisation.
A funny fact is that the exact same bug was independently uncovered and [corrected in KVM later by Avi Kivity](http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=0a79b009525b160081d75cef5dbf45817956acf2) (CVE-2009-3722). The reason may be a not perfectly clear Intel documentation about the differences between MOV\_DR and MOV\_CR events in hardware virtualisation.
This bug has already been addressed by Microsoft in Windows 7 and will get corrected in the next service pack for Virtual PC and Virtual Server.

### [CVE-2009-2267: Mishandled exception on page fault in VMware](https://blog.cr0.org/2009/10/cve-2009-2267-mishandled-exception-on.html)

Tavis Ormandy and myself have recently released an advisory for CVE-2009-2267.

This is a vulnerability in VMware's virtual CPU which can lead to privilege escalation in a guest. All VMware virtualisation products were affected, including in hardware virtualisation mode.

In a VMware guest, in the general case, unprivileged (Ring 3) code runs without VMM intervention until an exception or interrupt occurs. An exception to this is Virtual-8086 mode (VM86) where VMware will perform CPU emulation.

When VMware was emulating a far call instruction in VM86 mode, it was using supervisory access to push the CS and IP registers. Because of this, if this operation raisee a Page Fault (#PF) exception, the resulting exception code would be invalid and would have it's user/supervisor flag incorrectly set.

This can be used to confuse a Guest kernel. Moreover, VM86 mode can be used to further confuse the guest kernel because it allows an attacker to load an arbitrary value in the code segment (CS) register.

We wrote a reliable proof of concept to elevate privileges on Linux guests. It turned out to be very easy because of the [PNP BIOS recovery code](http://lxr.linux.no/#linux+v2.6.24/arch/x86/mm/extable_32.c).

For further details, check our [advisory](http://www.cr0.org/misc/CVE-2009-2267.txt), [VMware's advisory](http://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2009-0015.html) and the non weaponized PoC ([vmware86.c](http://www.cr0.org/misc/vmware86.c), [vmware86.tar.gz](http://www.cr0.org/misc/vmware86.tar.gz)), including Tavis' cool CODE32 macro.

Note that VMware silently patches their products until all all of them are updated and then releases an advisory. If you have updated VMware Workstation a few month ago, you were already protected against this vulnerability.

In theory, VMware's Virtual CPU flaws could be treated like Intel or AMD errata and worked around in operating systems. In practice, since VMware's software can be updated, this is unlikely to happen. Moreover, VMware doesn't release full details that could be used to produce work arounds.

If you like virtual CPU vulnerabilities, I suggest that you have a look at [Derek Soeder's awesome advisory](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/498150) from last year.

### Linux NULL pointer dereference due to incorrect proto\_ops initializations (CVE-2009-2692)

EDIT2: [Here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=516949#c10) is RedHat's official mitigation recommendation

EDIT3: [Brad Spengler](http://www.grsecurity.net/) also wrote an exploit for this [and published it](http://grsecurity.net/~spender/wunderbar_emporium.tgz). The bug triggering is based on our exploit which leaked to Brad though the private vendor-sec mailing list. He implements the [personality trick](http://blog.cr0.org/2009/06/bypassing-linux-null-pointer.html) Tavis and I published in June to bypass mmap\_min\_addr and also makes use of a feature that allows any unconfined user to gain the right to [map at address zero](http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/30084.html) in Redhat's default SELinux policy. He wrote a reliable shellcode for this one that should work pretty much anywhere on x86 and x86\_64 machines.

EDIT4: if you use Debian or Ubuntu on your machine, I have specifically updated the [kernelsec Debian/Ubuntu GrSecurity packages](http://kernelsec.cr0.org/) to protect against this bug and others.

EDIT5: Zinx wrote an [ARM Android root exploit](http://milw0rm.com/sploits/android-root-20090816.tar.gz)

EDIT6: Ramon de Carvalho Valle wrote a [PPC/PPC64/x86\_64/i386 exploit](http://www.risesecurity.org/entry/illustrating-linux-sock_sendpage-null-pointer/)

Tavis Ormandy and myself have recently found and investigated a Linux kernel vulnerability (CVE-2009-2692). It affects all 2.4 and 2.6 kernels since 2001 on all architectures. We believe this is the public vulnerability affecting the greatest number of kernel versions.

The issue lies in how Linux deals with unavailable operations for some protocols. [sock\_sendpage](http://lxr.linux.no/linux%2Bv2.6.30.4/net/socket.c#L727) and others don't check for NULL pointers before dereferencing operations in the ops structure. Instead the kernel relies on correct initialization of those proto\_ops structures with stubs (such as [sock\_no\_sendpage](http://lxr.linux.no/linux%2B%2A/net/core/sock.c#L1651)) instead of NULL pointers.

At first sight, the [code in af\_ipx.c](http://lxr.linux.no/linux%2Bv2.6.30.4/net/ipx/af_ipx.c#L1935) looks correct and seems to initialize .sendpage properly. However, due to a bug in the [SOCKOPS\_WRAP](http://lxr.linux.no/linux%2Bv2.6.30.4/include/linux/net.h#L289) macro, sock\_sendpage will not be initialized. This code is very fragile and there are many other protocols where proto\_ops are not correctly initialized at all (vulnerable even without the bug in SOCKOPS\_WRAP), see [bluetooth for instance](http://lxr.linux.no/linux%2Bv2.6.30.4/net/bluetooth/bnep/sock.c#L169).

So it was decided that instead of patching all those protocols and continue to rely on this very fragile code, sock\_sendpage would get patched to check against NULL. This was already the way [sock\_splice\_read](http://lxr.linux.no/linux%2Bv2.6.30.4/net/socket.c#L742) and others were handled.

Since it leads to the kernel executing code at NULL, the vulnerability is as trivial as it can get to exploit (edit: that's for local privilege escalation and on Intel architectures): an attacker can just put code in the first page that will get executed with kernel privileges. Our exploit took a few minutes to adapt from a previous one:

$ ./leeches

On x86/x86\_64, this issue could be mitigated by three things:

* the recent mmap\_min\_addr feature. Note that this feature has [known issues](http://blog.cr0.org/2009/06/bypassing-linux-null-pointer.html) until at least 2.6.30.2. See also this [LWN article](http://lwn.net/Articles/342330/).

   It's not exploitable for code execution on all architectures. My sparc server for instance is safe ;)

   What if you have IPX completely disabled in your kernel? Looking at your discovery, I can see how this would be a problem for people with very modular kernels/

   This is one reason so many 64b systems (Tru64 on Alpha being a good example) prevent mapping the first 32 bits of address space. Surprising that Linux doesn't do the same.

    ?? First of all - the whole problem has nothing to do with architecture of the used CPU (intel, non-intel, 32bit, 64bit).

    Secondly - Linux also offers such protection, but it was somehow flawed until one of the kernel versions

    3rdly - It is guaranteed on some systems (SVR4) that the fisrt page is always mapped (PROT\_READ afair), so linux tries to emulate that behavior via the personality mechanism - http://linux.die.net/man/2/personality - and that is where the bug lied (the one with mapping zero page).

    Exploit code has been available at http://grsecurity.net/~spender/wunderbar\_emporium.tgz

    Works on all affected kernels: both x86 and x64, 4k stacks or 8k stacks, cred framework or not. Disables SELinux, AppArmor, LSM, and auditing. Also plays an embedded movie if the host is up to it.

    Don't use the one from securityfocus, they have an old version of the exploit.

    Why can't the kernel track the process that map page zero and does extra stuff when switching from user mode to kernel mode (update mmu to make it not excecutable, ...)

    Of course this will slowdown these processes but are there performance program that depend of that ?
    Wine ?

    Looks like you where to fast when you thanked Dan, because SELinux does indeed stop this:

    $ LANG=C sh wunderbar\_emporium.sh

    Doesn't work with SELinux, although you claim the opposite in the source:

    sh wunderbar\_emporium.sh
    runcon: invalid context:
    unconfined\_u:unconfined\_r:initrc\_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023: Invalid argument
    UNABLE TO MAP ZERO PAGE!

    and the raw audit message for this:
    localhost.localdomain type=AVC msg=audit(1250278420.753:27501): avc: denied { mmap\_zero } for pid=16933 comm="exploit" scontext=unconfined\_u:unconfined\_r:unconfined\_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 tcontext=unconfined\_u:unconfined\_r:unconfined\_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 tclass=memprotect

    So obviously you were to fast when you thanked Dan for "great SELinux bypass".

    Fedora's SELinux policy (asuuming you leave it enforcing) protects from the exploit (runcon can't change the type).

    So there's actually two bugs. One is NULL pointer dereference and the other is allowing to mmap (presumably unmmapable) memory at 0x0 location (even if /proc/sys/vm/mmap\_min\_addr > 0).

    Here's a reply to some of the comments (not all, sorry):

    - @Anonymous: you're correct, about SPARC. Interestingly, IA32 could also be safe but is not for performances reasons (unless you use Linux 2.0 or PaX KERNEXEC/UDEREF). x86\_64 however killed segmentation :(
    - About mapping to Null. This should be protected by mmap\_min\_addr since Linux 2.6.23. Last month, [Tavis and I published a way to bypass it by using personalities](http://blog.cr0.org/2009/06/bypassing-linux-null-pointer.html) and Pulseaudio. Brad Spengler then implemented this technique in an exploit and noticed that it worked even without the Pulseaudio trick. The reason was the default SELinux policy allowing unconfined users to mmap at address zero.

    It did exploit Fedora SELinux up until August 13, then was patched. I successfully exploited Kernel 2.6.29.6-213.fc11.i586 with this mechanism.

    Is it not normal procedure to inform the Kernel maintainers before publishing an exploit to the world? It took until 13th August for a patch to be released.
