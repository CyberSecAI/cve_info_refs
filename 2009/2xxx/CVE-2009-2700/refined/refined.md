Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-2700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Qt (a cross-platform application development framework) handles X.509 certificates. Specifically, it fails to properly process certificates containing NULL characters within the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** Qt's certificate handling logic does not correctly validate the SAN field of X.509 certificates, allowing NULL bytes to be present when they should not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. By crafting a malicious certificate with NULL characters in the SAN field, they can intercept and potentially manipulate encrypted communications.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could potentially view sensitive information transmitted over encrypted channels.
- **Data Tampering:** The attacker could alter encrypted communications, leading to further malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and redirect network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to perform a MitM attack. This usually implies that the attacker has to be on the same network as the victim or has the ability to intercept traffic between the victim and a server.
- The attacker needs to be able to generate or obtain a certificate with a manipulated SAN field.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects several Ubuntu versions, including 9.04 (Jaunty), 8.10 (Intrepid), and 8.04 (Hardy).
- Patches were released for affected `libqt4-network` and `libqt4-core` packages in respective Ubuntu distributions to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The fix involves using `QString::fromLatin1` instead of `QLatin1String` in `network/qsslcertificate.cpp` to handle the SAN field correctly.
- The vulnerability is related to the handling of certificates and impacts the secure communication.
