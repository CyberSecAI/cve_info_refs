Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information from the provided documents:

**CVE-2009-2909**

*   **Root Cause:** An unsigned comparison in the `ax25` socket handler allowed negative values to bypass a size check, leading to a buffer overflow when processing socket options (`setsockopt`).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Incorrect signedness check in the ax25 socket option handler.
    *   Potential for integer wrapping leading to a buffer overflow.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Kernel crash (Denial of Service).
    *   Potential for arbitrary code execution (as indicated in the SUSE advisory, though the initial analysis suggested only DoS).
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local attacker can manipulate socket options (specifically `SO_BINDTODEVICE`) when setting up or using AX.25 sockets.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Local user account.
    *   Ability to create and manipulate AX.25 sockets and set socket options.

**Technical Details (From Mailing List and Bugzilla):**

*   The vulnerability resides in the `af_ax25.c` file of the Linux kernel.
*   The vulnerable code snippet used the following logic:
    ```c
    case SO_BINDTODEVICE:
        if (optlen > IFNAMSIZ) optlen=IFNAMSIZ;
        if (copy_from_user(devname, optval, optlen))
            return -EFAULT;
    ```
*   The `optlen` variable could be manipulated by an attacker, by providing a negative value which would pass the unsigned comparison `optlen > IFNAMSIZ`, but cause a buffer overflow in `copy_from_user` due to the `BUG_ON((long) n < 0);` check within copy_from_user.
* The fix involves casting `sizeof(int)` to `(int)sizeof(int)` in the check to enforce a signed comparison:
    ```c
        if (optlen < (int)sizeof(int))
            return -EINVAL;
    ```
    This prevents negative `optlen` values from passing the check.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in the Linux kernel.
*   The issue was fixed upstream with commit b7058842c940ad2c08dd829b21e5c92ebe3b8758.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry notes that RHEL 4, 5, and MRG were not affected due to the AX.25 driver not being enabled, and RHEL 3 was only affected if the `kernel-unsupported` package was installed.
* Ubuntu was affected in versions 8.04, 8.10 and 9.04 but not 9.10.
* SUSE also released patches for their affected products.
*   The `af_packet` issue mentioned in the same mailing list post was considered a bug, and not a security vulnerability, as the code would reset the invalid `len` to a sane value before being used.

**Summary of Impacts**
This vulnerability could allow a local attacker to trigger a kernel crash (DoS) and potentially gain code execution, through a crafted `setsockopt` call with negative length, on a system that is running the vulnerable kernel and has the AX.25 protocol enabled.
