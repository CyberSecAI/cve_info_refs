Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in the context of CVE-2009-2982:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in multiple vulnerabilities present in Adobe Reader and Acrobat versions 9.1.3 and earlier, 8.1.6 and earlier, and 7.1.3 and earlier.
*   These vulnerabilities are triggered when a user opens a specially crafted PDF file.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities exist within the parsing and processing of PDF files by Adobe Reader and Acrobat.
*   These vulnerabilities can be triggered by crafted malicious PDF documents.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Arbitrary File/Folder Write:** Attackers can write arbitrary files or folders to the filesystem.
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can potentially gain elevated privileges on the system.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Exploitation may lead to a denial-of-service condition, making the system unusable.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF Files:** The primary attack vector involves distributing specially crafted malicious PDF files to potential victims.
*   **Web Browsers:** The Adobe Reader browser plugin enables automatic opening of PDF files directly from websites, which could be exploited.
*   **Email Attachments:** Malicious PDF files can be distributed as email attachments to unsuspecting users.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting Malicious PDF:** An attacker needs to be able to craft a PDF file that triggers the vulnerabilities.
*   **Distribution Channel:** Attackers need a distribution method to deliver the malicious PDF to potential victims. This could be achieved through:
    *   Websites hosting malicious PDF files.
    *   Phishing emails with malicious PDF attachments.
    *   Compromised websites injecting malicious PDF links/iframes.
*   **User Interaction:**  Successful exploitation requires the user to open the crafted malicious PDF document.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory explicitly states that these vulnerabilities are being actively exploited, indicating a real-world threat.
*   Mitigations are provided, including updating Adobe software, enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in Windows, disabling JavaScript in Adobe Reader, and preventing automatic PDF opening in web browsers. These measures can be used to reduce the attack surface.
