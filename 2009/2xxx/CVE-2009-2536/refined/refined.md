  "related": true,
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of limit on the number of HTML elements that the `select()` method can handle. When called with a large integer, it leads to excessive memory allocation, eventually exhausting system memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption due to unbounded memory allocation.",
        "Lack of input validation for the `select()` method's integer argument."
    ],
    "impact": "The impact varies across browsers and operating systems. It ranges from browser crashes due to null pointer dereferences or memory exhaustion, to system reboots due to memory management failures. In some cases, applications become unstable. Specific impacts include:\n\n*   Browser crashes due to memory exhaustion.\n*   Operating system reboots (Konqueror on Ubuntu).\n*   Unstable applications due to memory exhaustion.\n*   Device hangs requiring hard resets (Nintendo Wii, Sony PS3, iPhone).",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTML page containing a JavaScript call to the `select()` method with a large integer value, which triggers excessive memory allocation. Users accessing the malicious page through a vulnerable browser are affected.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to host a malicious HTML page that a user can access with a vulnerable browser. No special user privileges or system access is needed."
