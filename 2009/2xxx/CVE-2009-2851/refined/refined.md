Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-2851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of comment author URLs within the WordPress administrator interface. Specifically, when these URLs are displayed in the admin panel, they are not properly escaped, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS flaw. The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the comment author URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML, which, when rendered in an administrator's browser, can perform actions within the context of that user's session. This could potentially lead to a variety of attacks.
*   **Phishing:** A common impact would be to redirect the administrator to a malicious site, possibly a phishing site designed to steal credentials. This is specifically mentioned in the provided text "This could be exploited to redirect you away from the admin to another site."
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions on the WordPress site on behalf of the administrator, such as creating new users, modifying site settings, or deleting content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Comment Author URL:** The primary attack vector is via a malicious URL provided as the comment author's website or URL. The vulnerable code renders these URLs without escaping, leading to the XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Post Comments:** An attacker needs to be able to submit comments to a WordPress site. Depending on the site's configuration, this could be as easy as posting a comment on a public blog post.
*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload.
*   **Administrator Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator views the comment section in the admin panel. The administrator does not necessarily need to click on the injected URL directly but just have it rendered in the admin dashboard.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in WordPress version 2.8.2.
*   The identified fix was to properly sanitize comment author URLs before displaying them in the admin panel.
*   The vulnerability is described as a "low" severity issue in the Red Hat bugzilla entry, but this doesn't diminish the risk that could arise if exploited.
