    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2009-2981",
      "CVERescription": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Source": {
      "US-CERT": {
        "Alert": "TA09-286B",
        "Systems Affected": [
          "Adobe Reader and Acrobat 9.1.3 and earlier 9.x versions",
          "Adobe Reader and Acrobat 8.1.6 and earlier 8.x versions",
          "Adobe Reader and Acrobat 7.1.3 and earlier 7.x versions"
        ],
        "Overview": "Multiple vulnerabilities affect Adobe Reader and Acrobat. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file. The Adobe Reader browser plug-in is available for multiple Web browsers and operating systems, which can automatically open PDF documents hosted on a Web site. These vulnerabilities are being actively exploited.",
        "Impact": "These vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, write arbitrary files or folders to the filesystem, escalate local privileges, or cause a denial of service on an affected system as the result of a user opening a malicious PDF document.",
         "Solution": [
          "Update: Adobe has released updates to address this issue. Users are encouraged to read Adobe Security Bulletin [APSB09-15] and update vulnerable versions of Adobe Reader and Acrobat.",
          "Enable Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in Microsoft Windows. DEP can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases.",
           "Disable JavaScript in Adobe Reader and Acrobat. Disabling JavaScript may prevent some exploits from resulting in code execution.",
           "Prevent Internet Explorer from automatically opening PDF documents by reverting to a safer option that prompts the user.",
           "Disable the display of PDF documents in the Web browser.",
          "Do not access PDF documents from untrusted sources."
        ],
        "References": [

      }
    },
     "Analysis": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is due to multiple unspecified vulnerabilities within the Adobe Reader and Acrobat software, allowing for malicious PDF documents to be exploited.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Arbitrary code execution",
        "Arbitrary file or folder writing",
        "Local privilege escalation",
        "Denial of service"
      ],
      "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code, write arbitrary files or folders to the filesystem, escalate local privileges, or cause a denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "Convincing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file. This can be done through websites or email attachments. The Adobe Reader browser plugin could automatically open PDF files from a website.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF document and have it delivered to a user. User interaction is required to open the malicious PDF document."
