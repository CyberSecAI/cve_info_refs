      "Improper handling of command values in SMB packets"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted SMB packet and sending the packet to an affected system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to send network messages to a computer running the Server service."
