Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS10-008, specifically addressing CVE-2010-0252:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Microsoft Data Analyzer ActiveX Control. When this control is instantiated in Internet Explorer, it can corrupt the system's state, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A remote code execution vulnerability exists due to a flaw in how the ActiveX control handles certain operations, leading to memory corruption when used in Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted web page.
- An attacker could host a malicious website, or compromise legitimate ones (including those accepting user-provided content or ads), to deliver the exploit.
- The attacker relies on social engineering to convince users to visit the malicious page, often through links in emails or instant messages.
- Malicious web content could be delivered using banner ads or other methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host or compromise web pages.
- The attacker needs to convince the target user to visit the malicious page with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer with the vulnerable ActiveX control already installed.
- The attacker does not need prior access to the victim's system.

**Additional Details:**
- The Microsoft Data Analyzer ActiveX control is not installed by default with Microsoft Office. It requires a separate manual installation.
- This bulletin also addresses kill bits for third-party ActiveX controls, including Symantec WinFax Pro 10.3, Google Desktop Gadget v5.8, Facebook Photo Updater 5.5.8, and PandaActiveScan Installer 2.0.
- The update is delivered as a cumulative update, including previously released kill bits.
- The security update operates by setting a kill bit, preventing the vulnerable control from loading within Internet Explorer. This means the vulnerable control is blocked even if installed at a later date.
- The severity rating varies across different Windows versions due to mitigations like Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server.
