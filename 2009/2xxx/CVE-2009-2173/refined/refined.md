{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Carom3D game has a buffer overflow vulnerability and a denial-of-service vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow: Occurs when a large string argument (218+ bytes) is passed to the 'carom.exe' executable.",
    "Denial of Service: Occurs when a user creates a LAN game room and an attacker sends a simple HTTP GET/POST request to the listening port (28012), locking the GUI of the game."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": [
    "Buffer Overflow: Program crashes due to a buffer overrun, as indicated by the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library 'Buffer Overrun' error message.",
    "Denial of Service: The game's GUI becomes unresponsive, requiring a forced quit."
  ],
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Buffer Overflow: By providing a long string argument when executing the 'carom.exe' application.",
    "Denial of Service: By sending an HTTP GET/POST request to the game's listening port (28012) on the host of the user hosting the game."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Buffer Overflow: Ability to execute the 'carom.exe' with a crafted command line argument.",
    "Denial of Service: Ability to send HTTP requests to the target host's network and the host is hosting a game."
  ]
