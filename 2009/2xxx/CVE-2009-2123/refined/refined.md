Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-2123:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `show_activity.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly included in a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

    ```php
    $query_activity = sprintf("SELECT * FROM " .$prefix_db. "_activity WHERE ay_bugid_fk=" .$_GET['id']. "");
    ```

*   **Weakness:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input validation and sanitization.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to:
        *   Data exfiltration: The attacker can extract sensitive information from the database.
        *   Data modification: The attacker can modify or delete data in the database.
        *   Authentication bypass: In some cases, the attacker might be able to bypass authentication mechanisms.
        *   Complete compromise: Depending on the database permissions and application architecture, the attacker could potentially gain full control of the database server and the application.

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The vulnerability is located in the `show_activity.php` script.
    *   The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter `id`.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit for the SQL injection vulnerability:

    ```
    http://www.site.com/show_activity.php?id=null+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,version(),7,8--
    ```
    This demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL code into the query.

*   The provided content also mentions other vulnerabilities in Elvin BTS 1.2.0, including:
    *   Local File Inclusion (LFI)
    *   SQL Injection Login Bypass
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    *   Source Code Disclosure

*   The multiple CVEs mentioned in the second exploit database entry are related to the same application and version, likely discovered at the same time. It does not appear to be a different issue for the same CVE but rather the same issue mentioned on another entry.

The content provides useful details about the vulnerability, its location, and how it can be exploited, which is more detailed than the generic CVE description.
