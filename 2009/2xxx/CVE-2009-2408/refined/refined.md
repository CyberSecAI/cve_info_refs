Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the inconsistent handling of domain names within SSL certificates, specifically regarding the presence of NULL characters. Certificate Authorities (CAs) would issue certificates for hostnames containing embedded NULL characters if the domain after the NULL character was owned by the requester. However, SSL clients (like browsers), would often ignore the portion of the name after the NULL character and only validate the part before it. This mismatch allowed attackers to obtain valid certificates for domains they did not own.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Mismatched handling of NULL characters:** The core vulnerability is the discrepancy between how certificate authorities and SSL clients interpret null characters within X.509 certificate names. CAs would consider the domain after the null character, while clients only validate the domain before.
*   **Lack of proper sanitization/validation:** SSL clients lacked the necessary validation to reject certificates with embedded NULL characters, or, in the case of OpenLDAP's GnuTLS implementation, relied on the first Common Name (CN) field instead of the last one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Attackers could obtain fraudulent SSL certificates for any domain by embedding NULL characters. With these certificates, they could intercept and potentially alter encrypted communication between clients and servers.
*   **Spoofing trusted websites:** Attackers could impersonate legitimate websites, including banking sites, to steal credentials or manipulate transactions, as clients would consider the certificates as valid due to the flaw.
*  **Code Execution:** As Firefox uses SSL to protect integrity of security updates, a malicious update could be served using the crafted certificate.
* **Denial of Service:** In some cases, the vulnerability can lead to application crashes via a specially crafted certificate containing regex patterns.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted X.509 certificates:** The primary attack vector involves creating a certificate with a NULL byte within the Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName fields.
*   **Compromised or malicious CAs:** An attacker might use a compromised CA or try to trick a legitimate CA into signing a malicious certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Request Certificates:** The attacker needs to be able to request certificates from a Certificate Authority (CA).
*   **Domain Control (partial):** The attacker needs to control the domain name after the null byte.
*   **Network Position (for MitM):** To intercept traffic, the attacker needs to be in a position to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.
*  **Ability to Serve Updates (For code execution):** The attacker needs to be able to serve updates in a way that would be considered a trusted source.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Dan Kaminsky, with an independent report by Moxie Marlinspike.
*   Multiple vendors and software (including Firefox, NSS, OpenLDAP, wget, mutt and Qt) were affected by this class of vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by correcting the name validation process to properly handle or reject certificates containing embedded NULL characters.

The content also provides additional information about affected software, such as:

*  **openSUSE:** The vulnerability impacted multiple openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise versions, including openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10 and SLE11.
* **Debian:** The vulnerability affected the `nss` package on the stable `lenny` and unstable `sid` distributions, and was addressed with a patch.
* **Red Hat:** Multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions were affected and fixed via errata.
* **Ubuntu:** The vulnerability was present in nss packages and fixed in Ubuntu 8.04, 8.10 and 9.04 versions.
