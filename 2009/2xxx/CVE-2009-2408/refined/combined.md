1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- cyrus-imapd
This update fixes another buffer overflow in the Sieve code. This can
be exploited by users allowed to use their own sieve scripts to execute
arbitrary code remotely.
CVE-2009-3235: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.5 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
Additionally the handling of long headers was improved.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- neon/libneon
neon did not properly handle embedded NUL characters in X.509
certificates when comparing host names. Attackers could exploit that
to spoof SSL servers.
CVE-2009-2408: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.5 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
Specially crafted XML documents that contain a large number of
nested entity references could cause neon to consume large amounts
of CPU and memory (CVE-2009-2473).
CVE-2009-2473: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- freeradius
This update of freeradius fixes a remote denial-of-service bug in function
rad\_decode() which can be triggered by zero-length Tunnel-Password attri-
butes to make radiusd crash.
CVE-2009-3111: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: SLE10 SP3
- strongswan
The previous fix for a flaw in the ASN.1 parser was incomplete and
had to be reworked.
This could lead to crashes of the pluto IKE daemon.
CVE-2009-2661: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: SLE10 SP3
- openldap2
This update of openldap2 makes SSL certificate verification more robust
against uses of the special character \0 in the subjects name.
CVE-2009-2408: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.5 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
Affected products: SLE10 SP3
- apache2-mod\_jk
Certain HTTP request could confuse the JK connector in Apache Tomcat which
could result in a user seeing responses destined for other users.
CVE-2008-5519: CVSS v2 Base Score: 2.6 (LOW) (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- expat
Specially crafted XML documents could make expat run into an enless loop,i
therefore locking up applications using expat.
CVE-2009-3720: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could cause buffer overflows in xpdf
when viewing such a document.
CVE-2009-3603: CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.3 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3604: CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.3 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3605: CVSS v2 Base Score: 10.0 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3606: CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.3 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3608: CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.3 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3609: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- mozilla-nspr
This update fixes a bug in the Mozilla NSPR helper libraries, which could
be used by remote attackers to potentially execute code via javascript
vectors.
MFSA 2009-59:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the execution
of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus be leveraged by
the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
CVE-2009-1563: CVSS v2 Base Score: 10.0 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0-11.1, SLE10, SLE11

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1874-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
August 26, 2009                       <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : nss
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-2404 CVE-2009-2408 CVE-2009-2409

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Network Security
Service libraries. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-2404

   Moxie Marlinspike discovered that a buffer overflow in the regular
   expression parser could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-2408

   Dan Kaminsky discovered that NULL characters in certificate
   names could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks by tricking the user
   into accepting a rogue certificate.

CVE-2009-2409

   Certificates with MD2 hash signatures are no longer accepted
   since they're no longer considered cryptograhically secure.

The old stable distribution (etch) doesn't contain nss.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-0lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-42

## Compromise of SSL-protected communication

Announced
August 1, 2009
Reporter
Dan Kaminsky
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, NSS, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.13
* Firefox 3.5
* NSS 3.12.3
* SeaMonkey 1.1.18
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.23

### Description

IOActive security researcher **Dan Kaminsky** reported a
mismatch in the treatment of domain names in SSL certificates between SSL
clients and the Certificate Authorities (CA) which issue server certificates.
In particular, if a malicious person requested a certificate for a host name
with an invalid `null` character in it most CAs would issue the
certificate if the requester owned the domain specified after the null, while
most SSL clients (browsers) ignored that part of the name and used the
unvalidated part in front of the null. This made it possible for attackers to
obtain certificates that would function for any site they wished to target.
These certificates could be used to intercept and potentially alter encrypted
communication between the client and a server such as sensitive bank
account transactions.

This vulnerability was independently reported to us by researcher
**Moxie Marlinspike** who also noted that since Firefox
relies on SSL to protect the integrity of security updates this attack
could be used to serve malicious updates.

Mozilla would like to thank Dan and the Microsoft Vulnerability
Research team for coordinating a multiple-vendor response to this problem.

### Workaround

Users of unfixed versions of Firefox 3.0 who are concerned about the
potential for this attack on their network should download the latest
Firefox 3.5 from our web site, and on Windows ensure that the installer is
signed and that "Mozilla Corporation" is the publisher.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-810-1: NSS vulnerabilities

4 August 2009

NSS vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [nss](/security/cves?package=nss) -

## Details

Moxie Marlinspike discovered that NSS did not properly handle regular

expressions in certificate names. A remote attacker could create a

specially crafted certificate to cause a denial of service (via application

crash) or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2009-2404](/security/CVE-2009-2404))

Moxie Marlinspike and Dan Kaminsky independently discovered that NSS did

not properly handle certificates with NULL characters in the certificate

name. An attacker could exploit this to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack

to view sensitive information or alter encrypted communications.

([CVE-2009-2408](/security/CVE-2009-2408))

Dan Kaminsky discovered NSS would still accept certificates with MD2 hash

signatures. As a result, an attacker could potentially create a malicious

trusted certificate to impersonate another site. ([CVE-2009-2409](/security/CVE-2009-2409))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.04

* [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.9.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.9.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.04.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any applications that

use NSS, such as Firefox, to effect the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi!

CVE-2009-2408-like problems were identified and fixed in some more
applications...

wget - bunch of relevant links are available in here:
  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=520454>

mutt, when using OpenSSL, fixed via:
  [http://dev.mutt.org/trac/changeset/6016:dc09812e63a3/mutt_ssl.c](http://dev.mutt.org/trac/changeset/6016%3Adc09812e63a3/mutt_ssl.c)
This only applies to 1.5.19 and later, as no name check was done in
earlier versions when OpenSSL was used for crypto, which is a problem
by itself:
  <http://dev.mutt.org/trac/ticket/3087>

Qt got CVE-2009-2700, earlier versions of KDE use own crypto wrapper
implemented in kdelibs, which is affected too:
  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2009-2702>

OpenLDAP upstream did some changes that addressed this in OpenSSL
wrapping code, along with change related to handling of multiple CNs:
  <http://www.openldap.org/devel/cvsweb.cgi/libraries/libldap/tls_o.c.diff?r1=1.8&r2=1.11&f=h>
They also changed GnuTLS code to check the last CN instead of the first
one, but this was not affected by CVE-2009-2408-like problems:
  <http://www.openldap.org/devel/cvsweb.cgi/libraries/libldap/tls_g.c.diff?r1=1.13&r2=1.14&f=h>
NSS wrapper was re-written too to do name checking itself and not rely
on NSS (CVE-2009-2408 should likely apply here directly and patched
NSS should be sufficient to address null prefix issue in this case;
I've not tested though, do your own tests if you build OpenLDAP with
NSS):
  <http://www.openldap.org/devel/cvsweb.cgi/libraries/libldap/tls_m.c.diff?r1=1.8&r2=1.11&f=h>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=510251#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-08 13:40:23 UTC  ``` In his upcoming Blackhat paper and presentation Dan Kaminsky highlights some more issues he has found relating to SSL hash collisions and related vulnerabilities.  His second issue is all about inconsistencies in the interpretation of subject x509 names in certificates.  Specifically "issue 2, attack 2c" regarding NULL terminators in a Common Name field.  An attacker could create a malicious certificate containing a NULL, which, if they were able to get it signed, could confuse a client into accepting it by mistake.  According to the paper this is said to affect Firefox.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=510251#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-27 07:52:50 UTC  ``` This issue is fixed in upstream NSS 3.12.3 by the following bzs:          Improper character escaping and unescaping in alg1485.c & secname.c         <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=480509>          Must escape DER DNS names when converting to zStrings         <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=484111>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=510251#c4)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-30 07:58:09 UTC  ``` This was also found by Moxie and presented in two talks at Blackhat last night.  Moxie was able to get a CA to sign a certificate containing a NULL in the CN name.
