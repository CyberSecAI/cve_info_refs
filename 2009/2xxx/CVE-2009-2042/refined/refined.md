Here's the breakdown of the information related to CVE-2009-2042 from the provided content:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an uninitialized-memory-read bug in libpng when processing 1-bit interlaced images. This occurs specifically when the width of these images is not divisible by 8.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uninitialized Memory Read:**  Libpng includes uninitialized bits in certain rows of a PNG file, exposing potentially sensitive data.
*   **Improper Parsing:** The library does not correctly handle 1-bit interlaced images with specific width values, leading to the inclusion of uninitialized memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read portions of sensitive memory by enticing a user or automated system into processing a specially crafted PNG image. This is achieved via "out-of-bounds pixels" in the file.
*   The impact is classified as potentially benign in most cases, however, sensitive data may be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PNG Images:**  The primary attack vector involves crafting malicious PNG files with the specific characteristics that trigger the vulnerability (1-bit interlaced images, widths not divisible by 8).
*   **User Interaction:**  Successful exploitation relies on a user or automated system being tricked into opening or processing the crafted PNG image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting PNGs:** Attackers need the ability to create specially crafted PNG images.
*   **Luring Victims:** Attackers need a method to make a victim process the crafted image (e.g., via website, email attachment, or other means).

**Additional Notes from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jeff Phillips.
*   The fix involves initializing memory when processing interlaced images.
*   The issue is present in libpng versions prior to 1.2.37.
*   Multiple Linux distributions, including Slackware, Gentoo, and Ubuntu, were affected and released updates to address the vulnerability.
*   VMware products were also affected, requiring updates to several of their tools and products.
*   Apple also released a security update for Mac OS X to address this vulnerability in the X11 libraries.
