      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.  They can also cause DoS, disclose information and memory, write or execute files, conduct session hijacking, steal cookies, bypass security policies, load untrusted files, connect to arbitrary hosts, and escalate privileges. Some attacks require specific conditions such as user interaction or a trusted environment.",
