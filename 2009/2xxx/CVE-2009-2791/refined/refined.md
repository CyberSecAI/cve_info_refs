Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-2791

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `pda_projects.php` script of ProjectButler 1.5.0. The script includes a file using `require_once($offset."class.project.inc");` where the `$offset` parameter is directly taken from user input via the `offset` GET parameter without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include and execute remote files by manipulating the `offset` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include and execute malicious code from a remote server by providing a URL in the `offset` parameter, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker injects a malicious URL into the `offset` parameter of a GET request to the vulnerable `pda_projects.php` script.
- Example: `http://localhost/[path]/pda/pda_projects.php?offset=[malicious_url]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `pda_projects.php` file.
- The attacker must have access to a server hosting a malicious PHP file, or some other method to include an arbitrary file.
