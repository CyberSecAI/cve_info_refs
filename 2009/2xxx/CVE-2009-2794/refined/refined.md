Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a conflict between the "Maximum inactivity time lock" setting configured by an Exchange server administrator and the user-defined "Require Passcode" setting on iOS devices. The "Maximum inactivity time lock" dictates how long a device can be idle before requiring a passcode for access to Exchange services. However, the "Require Passcode" setting on iOS could be set to a longer duration, overriding the server's setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inconsistent Security Settings:** The device's passcode timeout setting could be configured to be longer than the Exchange server's inactivity timeout, creating a loophole.
- **Lack of Enforcement:** The device did not properly enforce the server's inactivity timeout setting when a user defined a longer "Require Passcode" time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** A person with physical access to the device could bypass the Exchange-mandated timeout and access Exchange services during the period when the device is unlocked according to the user's "Require Passcode" setting but should have been locked by the "Maximum inactivity time lock"

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Physical Access:** The attacker must have physical possession of the iOS device.
- **Knowledge of the device's configuration:** The attacker would benefit from knowledge of the device's "Require Passcode" setting relative to the Exchange's "Maximum inactivity time lock" setting.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affected iOS 2.0 and later, and iOS for iPod touch 2.0 and later, up to version 3.0.1
- The fix involved disabling user choices for "Require Passcode" values greater than the "Maximum inactivity time lock" setting.
