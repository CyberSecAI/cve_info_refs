Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2009-2138:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The tbdev application, specifically version 01-01-2008, suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and insecure handling of user-supplied data.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `returnto` parameter in `makepoll.php` and `polls.php` is vulnerable to reflected XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected via this parameter.
    *   **Cross-Site Script Redirection:** The `returnto` parameter in `news.php` and `login.php` is vulnerable to cross-site script redirection. Attackers can redirect users to malicious sites using specially crafted URLs, including data URIs containing JavaScript.
    *  **HTML Injection:** Input fields like 'Info' and 'Avatar' in my.php allow injection of HTML and JavaScript, which is reflected in the application.  The Avatar field is also vulnerable to JavaScript injection and reflected in userdetails.php page.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Cross-Site Script Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to phishing pages or malicious websites.
     *   **HTML Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code, which can lead to defacement, redirection, or execution of malicious code.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   XSS and redirection vulnerabilities are exploited through crafted URLs that include malicious payloads within the `returnto` parameter.
    * HTML injection is exploited by injecting malicious content in the 'Info' and 'Avatar' fields.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **XSS/Redirection (Sysops/Mods):** Attackers need to craft malicious URLs that are then accessed by administrators or moderators via the `returnto` parameter.
    *  **Redirection (Anyone):** An attacker can craft malicious URL and trick any user into clicking the link.  The user will be required to log in.
    *   **HTML Injection:** The attacker must have access to modify the user profile.

**Specific Vulnerable Files and Parameters:**

*   `makepoll.php?returnto=`
*   `polls.php?action=delete&pollid=1&returnto=`
*   `news.php?action=delete&newsid=1&returnto=`
*   `login.php?returnto=`
*  `my.php` Info field
*  `my.php` Avatar field
* `userdetails.php?id=USERID`

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was confirmed between June 5th and 10th, 2009 and disclosed on June 12th, 2009.
*   The `returnto` parameter is a common source of vulnerabilities due to insecure redirection practices.
*  The HTML injection vulnerabilities is triggered on Internet Explorer 6 and perhaps 7
* The exploit-db entry links to the author's advisory, which may provide further details.
