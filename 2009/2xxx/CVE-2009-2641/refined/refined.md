```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses a variable `$page` without proper sanitization in a `require` statement, leading to file inclusion.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include arbitrary files, potentially executing malicious code or accessing sensitive information. With LFI, attacker can read local files on the server, with RFI, can include and execute code from a remote server.
- Attack vectors: The attacker can manipulate the `page` parameter in the URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
