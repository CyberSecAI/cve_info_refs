{
  "CVE-2009-2404": {
    "description": "Moxie Marlinspike discovered that NSS did not properly handle regular expressions in certificate names. A remote attacker could create a specially crafted certificate to cause a denial of service (via application crash) or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the Network Security Services (NSS) library when parsing certificate names with regular expressions. The vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of shell-like expressions during certificate name matching.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap overflow due to insufficient bounds checking in regular expression processing.",
        "Lack of proper input sanitization when handling certificate names.",
         "Use of non-standard shell-like expressions for certificate matching."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing the application or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A remote attacker presents a specially crafted certificate, potentially self-signed or signed by a trusted CA to trigger the vulnerability.",
         "The vulnerability is triggered during the certificate verification process when the application tries to match the certificate name."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Ability to create and present malicious certificates.",
         "Ability to intercept or influence network connections (if needed to present malicious certificate)"
      ],
      "additional_notes": [
          "The vulnerability is present in older versions of NSS and can be exploited by presenting malformed certificates.",
          "The vulnerability is triggered before hostname checking so even self-signed certs can trigger the vulnerability, if the user accepts the certificate (in older browser version)",
         "Newer versions of NSS (3.12.3 and later) by default use a different method for certificate name matching which is not vulnerable."
