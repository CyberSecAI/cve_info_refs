### Overview

The Oracle products and components listed above are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service.

The [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2010](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpuapr2010.html) addresses 47 vulnerabilities in various Oracle products and components, including 16 vulnerabilities in Sun products. The Advisory provides information about affected components, access and authorization required for successful exploitation, and the impact from the vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Oracle has associated CVE identifiers with the vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update. If significant additional details about vulnerabilities and remediation techniques become available, we will update the [Vulnerability Notes Database](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/).

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information.

### Solution

Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2010](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpuapr2010.html). Note that this document only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for previously known issues are not listed.

# USN-810-1: NSS vulnerabilities

4 August 2009

NSS vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [nss](/security/cves?package=nss) -

## Details

Moxie Marlinspike discovered that NSS did not properly handle regular

expressions in certificate names. A remote attacker could create a

specially crafted certificate to cause a denial of service (via application

crash) or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2009-2404](/security/CVE-2009-2404))

Moxie Marlinspike and Dan Kaminsky independently discovered that NSS did

not properly handle certificates with NULL characters in the certificate

name. An attacker could exploit this to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack

to view sensitive information or alter encrypted communications.

([CVE-2009-2408](/security/CVE-2009-2408))

Dan Kaminsky discovered NSS would still accept certificates with MD2 hash

signatures. As a result, an attacker could potentially create a malicious

trusted certificate to impersonate another site. ([CVE-2009-2409](/security/CVE-2009-2409))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.04

* [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.9.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.9.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss)
  -
  [3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/nss/3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.04.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any applications that

use NSS, such as Firefox, to effect the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1874-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
August 26, 2009                       <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : nss
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-2404 CVE-2009-2408 CVE-2009-2409

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Network Security
Service libraries. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-2404

   Moxie Marlinspike discovered that a buffer overflow in the regular
   expression parser could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-2408

   Dan Kaminsky discovered that NULL characters in certificate
   names could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks by tricking the user
   into accepting a rogue certificate.

CVE-2009-2409

   Certificates with MD2 hash signatures are no longer accepted
   since they're no longer considered cryptograhically secure.

The old stable distribution (etch) doesn't contain nss.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-0lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

RHSA-2009:1185 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2009-07-30
Updated:
2009-07-30
# RHSA-2009:1185 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: seamonkey security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix a security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Moxie Marlinspike reported a heap overflow flaw in a regular expression
parser in the NSS library (provided by SeaMonkey) used to match common
names in certificates. A malicious website could present a
carefully-crafted certificate in such a way as to trigger the heap
overflow, leading to a crash or, possibly, arbitrary code execution with
the permissions of the user running SeaMonkey. (CVE-2009-2404)

Note: in order to exploit this issue without further user interaction, the
carefully-crafted certificate would need to be signed by a Certificate
Authority trusted by SeaMonkey, otherwise SeaMonkey presents the victim
with a warning that the certificate is untrusted. Only if the user then
accepts the certificate will the overflow take place.

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
a backported patch to correct this issue. After installing the updated
packages, SeaMonkey must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This bug was reported to security@m.o by Moxie Marlinspike. From the email:
-----
The second [of two] is a heap overflow in the NSS code, for which the stars actually align and make it exploitable.
security/nss/lib/util/portreg.c:
141 static int
142 \_handle\_union(const char \*str, const char \*exp, PRBool case\_insensitive)
143 {
144 char \*e2 = (char \*) PORT\_Alloc(sizeof(char)\*strlen(exp));
145 register int t,p2,p1 = 1;
146 int cp;
147
148 while(1) {
149 for(cp=1;exp[cp] != ')';cp++)
150 if(exp[cp] == '\\')
151 ++cp;
152 for(p2 = 0;(exp[p1] != '|') && (p1 != cp);p1++,p2++) {
153 if(exp[p1] == '\\')
154 e2[p2++] = exp[p1++];
155 e2[p2] = exp[p1];
156 }
157 for (t=cp+1; ((e2[p2] = exp[t]) != 0); ++t,++p2) {}
158 if(\_shexp\_match(str,e2, case\_insensitive) == MATCH) {
159 PORT\_Free(e2);
160 return MATCH;
161 }
162 if(p1 == cp) {
163 PORT\_Free(e2);
164 return NOMATCH;
165 }
166 else ++p1;
167 }
168 }
You malloc out based on the strlen() on line 144, but then copy -- and happily copy past '\0' -- until you see ')' on line 154. A '\0' char can be placed in this string, wherever you want, by including a '~' in the string that is originally passed in to the parent function that is two levels up:
263 static int
264 port\_RegExpMatch(const char \*str, const char \*xp, PRBool case\_insensitive) {
265 register int x;
266 char \*exp = 0;
267
268 exp = PORT\_Strdup(xp);
269
270 if(!exp)
271 return 1;
272
273 for(x=strlen(exp)-1;x;--x) {
274 if((exp[x] == '~') && (exp[x-1] != '\\')) {
275 exp[x] = '\0';
276 if(\_shexp\_match(str,&exp[++x], case\_insensitive) == MATCH)
277 goto punt;
278 break;
279 }
280 }
281 if(\_shexp\_match(str,exp, case\_insensitive) == MATCH) {
282 PORT\_Free(exp);
283 return 0;
284 }
285
286 punt:
287 PORT\_Free(exp);
288 return 1;
289 }
You can see what happens to the '~' on line 274. So a string such as '(foo~bar)' will allocate strlen(foo) and then overwrite the bytes "bar" past the allocated memory.
This heap overflow can be triggered through, for instance, the CN field of a certificate. It seems like it shouldn't be possible to get arbitrary shellcode this far, but it actually is. If you generate a cert with your shellcode in the CN, and then mark that ASN.1 string as type 0x03, NSS lets everything in without mangling it.
The two nice things about this are:
1) You don't even have to get this signed. You can present a self-signed cert to NSS, and it'll go to validate the CN anyway in order to compile the complete list of problems with the certificate.
2) X509 is so fucked up that you can do almost all of the heap massaging and data placement you need with the certificate itself. This means that it's possible to exploit this with <img> tags to https links, since most of what you need can come in through the SSL connection itself. It makes scatter-shot exploitation easier, since you can post malicious img tags to forums and not have them filtered (in contrast to many browser exploits which require that lots of JS be rendered out).

This code is no longer used in NSS 3.21.3 (which is in FF 3.5) unless the
user specifically enables backwards-compatible wildcard matching (which
I'll bet NO USERS in the world have ever done).
The author confuses NSS and PSM functionality here. NSS does not check
for host name matches until after the cert passes validation. If a cert
does not pass validation, then its host name is never checked by NSS.
However, it may be that PSM still invokes the host name matching code
even for a cert that has failed validation. That would be a PSM bug.
But this is moot for FF 3.5 anyway.

Regarding the claims about IMG tags, there are no vulnerabilities here UNLESS
the user chooses to "trust" a CA that is willing to issue such malformed certs.
A cert from an untrusted issuer will fail validation and no host name match
will be performed on it. PSM will not do additional checks, because PSM does
not offer the user overrides for IMG tag connections. So, the only way that
a user would be vulnerable would be if the user trusted a CA issuing these
bad certs AND the user had enabled backward-compatible cert name matching in
FF 3.5. (Try this test: Can you even figure out how to do that?)

There are still a couple-hundred million Firefox 3.0 users. Still a problem for them, right?
And if NSS is fixed but PSM has the bug, Firefox users are still at risk either way.
What about self-signed certs? It is not too terribly hard to socially engineer people into accepting those, especially if they can be convinced the cert isn't trying to spoof their bank or some other site they care about. Firefox 3 makes it harder for people to click-through, but if you make the content sound enticing enough what can a temporary override hurt? Stupid, yes, but does not justify allowing them to be infected with malware.

Dan, I agree that there are numerous issues that are resolved in FF 3.5
but are still unresolved in the old version of NSS used in FF 3.0.
Correcting that is not an NSS bug/issue (as you know), but is a matter
of Mozilla taking a newer NSS back to the 1.9.0 branch.
What is the status of that effort?

In NSS 3.12.3, for FF 3.5, we decided to no longer use this 14+ year old
shexp code in NSS by default because its syntax is non-standard and allows
wildcards to be used in a way that is more relaxed than RFC 2818 allows.
So we decided to switch to a scheme that follows that RFC more closely, by
default.
We left the old code in there, and provided a way for users to re-enable it.
This was to allow corporate users whose certificates depend on the old shexp
syntax to continue to use those certs while they arrange to get new ones.
So, today, in NSS 3.12.3 and later (FF 3.5 and later), only users who have
chosen to enable that old code are vulnerable. They are a tiny minority
(maybe zero) of Firefox 3.5 users. For users of older software, the solution
is to upgrade to NSS 3.12.3, which is backwards binary compatible (except
for the change to shexp matching).
There are a variety of things we could do to close that vulnerability for the
few remaining users who experience it. They include:
a) remove the shexp code altogether, completely decommitting support for it.
(I think this is a non-starter for NSS's corporate sponsors.)
b) Remove support for the troublesome '~' syntax, which is little understood
anyway, I think, but preserve (most of) the rest of it.
c) try to preserve the entire existing grammar, and fix the code to work as
it was originally expected/intended. This may be a big job for code that
is on its way out.

This bug claims that "exploit works with self-signed certs", too. I don't see a proof that this is true.
Nelson claims this can't be true for NSS, or must be a bug in PSM.
Investigate this detail might be irrelevant, because the exploit is said to work with correctly signed certs and with certs allowed by an exception, too.

Attached patch

[Patch v1 for NSS Trunk (Work In Progress)](attachment.cgi?id=389270&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=389270&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=504456&attachment=389270)

This expression comparison function was designed to work in two passes:
1. First pass: determine if expression is valid
2. Second pass: determine if input string matches expression
The second pass intentionally omits many sanity tests (such as tests for
unexpected NUL characters in unions) because the first pass should detect
and eliminate them all. This is intended as a performance optimization.
The problem is that the first pass did not detect many expressions that the
second pass cannot handle. In particular, the second pass was not designed
to handle nested unions, nor exclusions ('~' rules) within unions, but the
first pass did not detect those things.
This patch changes the first pass to detect those things. I believe it
fixes the vulnerabilities previously disclosed in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=504456#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Exploitable heap overflow in NSS shell expression (filename globbing) parsing") above, without reducing the capabilities of the function from its previous ones (because I believe it never did handle nested unions nor exclusions within unions correctly). However, I suspect there may be more vulnerabilities in this code,
and I am continuing to look for them. So I am not yet requesting review.
@dveditz, Since this isn't crypto code, perhaps you can suggest some non-NSS
reviewers to help review it this weekend.

Patch v3 for trunk - for review
General comments:
After trying to follow what the code is trying to do, and seeing all the corner cases, I would be in favor of moving toward excising it completely at some point:).
None of these are actual bugs, so perhaps the r- is undeserved, but it would be good to clear these up. Issues 1 & 2 are the ones most critical in my mind.
1. Handling ~:
It appears we still have a lot of code trying to handle ~ which appears to be dead code now. The Validate only allows one 'active' ~ (escaped ~ and ~ inside [] are ok and interpreted as just plain ~). That ~ is handled directly in port\_RegExpMatch(). There can be no other occurances, yet we have code trying to do something with the ~, most notably lines 205, 216, 248, & 328-343.
2. Use of ret variable in \_shexp\_match.
The original version of \_shexp\_match had this bizzar mix of setting the return value and dropping out of the loop and simply returning with the expected return value. The new function converts almost all these instances to straight returns, but not all of them. Currently ret is being set at line 355 (but then used in a switch statement in which all cases return) and at lines 354 and 357, just before falling out to the if at 361, which, in turn drops out to line 364. It would be much easier to read if 354 and 357 simply return, The if check at 361 could be removed and the final return at line 364 would be simply:
return str[x] ? NOMATCH : MATCH;
3. line 195 the comment claims exp[0] points to the previous delimiter, when in fact it always points to the initial open paren '('. and exp+sx always points to the first character after the previous delimiter. The code itself is correct.
4. Question about handling of ranges.
The comments do not say that ranges are limited to starting and ending with alphanumerics (though the restiction is reasonable and implemented in the old version of the code). Even though both sets of code (new and old) only allow alphanumerics as the starting and ending of a range, they allow matches of non-alphanumerics within those ranges. In fact it takes a range like B-b or 0-f as valid (though not intuitive). This is why the case insensitive range match is so complicated, to handle these oddball matchings. It also means matching specifying A-z and a-Z yield different results when matching case insensitive (the former matches all letters and all non-alphanumerics between z and A, while the latter matches those same non-alphanumerics, but only matches a,A,z,Z). This last issue is more a documentation issue, but it does hightlight why turning this code off by default was the correct behavior.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=504456&attachment=389599)

Bob, thanks for your excellent review.
I believe I have addressed all your comments.
1. removed all the special '~' handling from \_shexp\_match.
2. removed variable ret entirely from \_shexp\_match.
3. corrected several comments and added several more at Julien's suggestion.
4. Yes, ranges are strange. I've added more comments in the header file.
I also simplified the case-insensitive range checking logic quite a bit.
Please let me know if my changes meet with your approval.

New test program for this library function
There are a couple minor issues with this patch :
1. no pathnames , though I assume it is meant to be in mozilla/security/nss/cmd/shexp
2. there are some C++ // comments in the program . They may break some compilers. This is the main reason for r-
3. typo in Usage - the word "strng" should be "string"
4. in Usage, the format of the [expected result] should be documented. I had to read the code to figure out that it wanted 0 for success and 1 for failure.
5. RFE :
I would much rather have the test program read multiple values from stdin or another file, so that it could do more than one test per program execution.
This would greatly facilitate running things like dbx check access to check for invalid boundary access, in a single dbx session.

This is OK, but I would prefer to have all the expressions in a data file rather than invoking the program multiple times. We may also want to add more expressions based on some recent review feedback.

Attached patch

[supplemental patch, v1](attachment.cgi?id=391497&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=391497&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=504456&attachment=391497)

This patch corrects the behavior for the following test case, which now fails:
$SHEXP '(A|/B)C(D|E)(F|g).(HI|jk)$' 'p/q/r/s/t' 1
It fails because the function returns -1 (INVALID\_SXP) instead of 1 (NO MATCH).
While not a security vulnerability, it is a regression for code that does the
wrong thing with -1 return values.
The patch is contributed by Jeff Walden <jwalden+bmo@mit.edu>

Yes, this issue is now public, although I haven't released an exploit.

c#40; Mitre write the descriptions but we can correct them if they get it wrong. I pointed them at the Red Hat bug <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2009-2404> for this which clearly states it is an NSS issue.
Moxie's talk is available online now, PDF and Video and explains this issue and points to the code:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-21 10:19:14 UTC  ``` A heap overflow flaw was found in a regular expression parser in the NSS library used to match common names in certificates.  A malicious site could present a carefully crafted certificate in such a way as to trigger the heap overflow leading to a crash or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running a browser such as firefox.  The overflow happens when the browser checks if the hostname of the site you are visiting matches the Common Name (CN) field of the presented certificate.  This check (cert_TestHostName) only happens automatically if the certificate is one that is signed by a Certificate Authority you have previously trusted.  If the attacker presents a malicious self-signed certificate, or one signed by an untrusted CA, the user is presented with a dialog box about the certificate before the vulnerable function is called.  If the user chooses to accept the certificate then the vulnerable function is called and the heap overflow happens.  So this issue does require slightly more user interaction to be exploited.  Co-incidentally, the handling of regular expressions for NSS versions 3.12.3 and above was changed to use a different and simpler regular expression routine which is not vulnerable to this issue.  Therefore where a system has NSS 3.12.3 installed, it is not vulnerable to this issue by default.  (Although it is possible to change Firefox back to use the old vulnerable library it is not something that is expected users to have done, and is not an obvious documented ability)  For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Firefox uses the system provided NSS library.  This library was updated to a versions greater than 3.12.3 by RHBA-2009:1161 on 20th July 2009.  Therefore systems updated to RHBA-2009:1161 are protected by default from this issue.  For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Firefox uses the system provided NSS library.  This library is due to be updated to a version greater than 3.12.3 and this will probably happen within the week (so before the embargo lifts).  For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 we do not ship Firefox but instead SeaMonkey which provides the NSS library.  SeaMonkey will need updating to correct this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-21 10:22:45 UTC  ``` I've verified the flaw by creating malicious test certificates (both signed by a personal CA and self-signed):  SeaMonkey on RHEL3 crashes with SEGV Firefox on RHEL5 prior to RHBA-2009:1161 crashes Firefox on RHEL5 after RHBA-2009:1161 does not call affected routine, no crash   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c11)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-27 13:27:45 UTC  ``` Because this issue requires extra user interaction it perhaps does not qualify to be labelled as severity critical (A victim would be presented with a display showing the bad certificate details and would have to accept it before the overflow happens).  However, recent research found that the certificate warnings are often ignored, and you could probably make your malicious certificate in such a way that the overflow isn't obvious when the certificate is displayed:  <http://www.goodgearguide.com.au/article/312438/security_certificate_warnings_don_t_work_researchers_say>  So therefore we'll keep this as AC:M and impact=critical   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c13)  Elio Maldonado Batiz    2009-07-28 15:33:40 UTC  ``` In the upstream patch for Firefox, as well in more current versions of NSS shipped with RHEL 4 and 5, the  NSS_USE_SHEXP_IN_CERT_NAME environment variable is checked. If set, the code reverts to the old way of checking for backward compatibility. If not set, which is the default, it then follows the RFC 2818 approach which fixes the problem. On RHEL-3 we can't count on NSS_USE_SHEXP_IN_CERT_NAME so this patch follows the RFC 2818 approach always thus fixing the problem. This patch is only required for RHEL-3.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c18)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-30 21:54:49 UTC  ``` Updating [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c11), Moxie found it was possible to get such a certificate signed by a CA.  Although the CA is likely to no longer issue certificates with nulls (and each attempt of your shellcode would require a new signed certificate), it may well be possible to use this attack without the need for the user to accept a certificate manually.  This is already rated impact=critical, so no change to the rating.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c19)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-30 21:56:08 UTC  ``` This issue was presented by MOXIE last night at Black Hat and is outlined in the public slides:         <http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/MARLINSPIKE/BHUSA09-Marlinspike-DefeatSSL-SLIDES.pdf>  Therefore removing embargo   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-30 22:10:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1184 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1184.html>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-30 22:19:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:1185 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1185.html>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-30 22:20:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1186 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1186.html>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-31 14:31:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2009:1190 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1190.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-12 14:31:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2009:1207 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1207.html>   ``` |  |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-43

## Heap overflow in certificate regexp parsing

Announced
August 1, 2009
Reporter
Moxie Marlinspike
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, NSS, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.13
* Firefox 3.5
* NSS 3.12.3
* SeaMonkey 1.1.18
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.23

### Description

**Moxie Marlinspike** reported a heap overflow vulnerability
in the code that handles regular expressions in certificate names. This
vulnerability could be used to compromise the browser and run arbitrary code
by presenting a specially crafted certificate to the client. This code
provided compatibility with the non-standard regular expression syntax
historically supported by Netscape clients and servers. With version 3.5
Firefox switched to the more limited industry-standard wildcard syntax
instead and is not vulnerable to this flaw.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-21 10:19:14 UTC  ``` A heap overflow flaw was found in a regular expression parser in the NSS library used to match common names in certificates.  A malicious site could present a carefully crafted certificate in such a way as to trigger the heap overflow leading to a crash or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running a browser such as firefox.  The overflow happens when the browser checks if the hostname of the site you are visiting matches the Common Name (CN) field of the presented certificate.  This check (cert_TestHostName) only happens automatically if the certificate is one that is signed by a Certificate Authority you have previously trusted.  If the attacker presents a malicious self-signed certificate, or one signed by an untrusted CA, the user is presented with a dialog box about the certificate before the vulnerable function is called.  If the user chooses to accept the certificate then the vulnerable function is called and the heap overflow happens.  So this issue does require slightly more user interaction to be exploited.  Co-incidentally, the handling of regular expressions for NSS versions 3.12.3 and above was changed to use a different and simpler regular expression routine which is not vulnerable to this issue.  Therefore where a system has NSS 3.12.3 installed, it is not vulnerable to this issue by default.  (Although it is possible to change Firefox back to use the old vulnerable library it is not something that is expected users to have done, and is not an obvious documented ability)  For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Firefox uses the system provided NSS library.  This library was updated to a versions greater than 3.12.3 by RHBA-2009:1161 on 20th July 2009.  Therefore systems updated to RHBA-2009:1161 are protected by default from this issue.  For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Firefox uses the system provided NSS library.  This library is due to be updated to a version greater than 3.12.3 and this will probably happen within the week (so before the embargo lifts).  For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 we do not ship Firefox but instead SeaMonkey which provides the NSS library.  SeaMonkey will need updating to correct this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-21 10:22:45 UTC  ``` I've verified the flaw by creating malicious test certificates (both signed by a personal CA and self-signed):  SeaMonkey on RHEL3 crashes with SEGV Firefox on RHEL5 prior to RHBA-2009:1161 crashes Firefox on RHEL5 after RHBA-2009:1161 does not call affected routine, no crash   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c11)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-27 13:27:45 UTC  ``` Because this issue requires extra user interaction it perhaps does not qualify to be labelled as severity critical (A victim would be presented with a display showing the bad certificate details and would have to accept it before the overflow happens).  However, recent research found that the certificate warnings are often ignored, and you could probably make your malicious certificate in such a way that the overflow isn't obvious when the certificate is displayed:  <http://www.goodgearguide.com.au/article/312438/security_certificate_warnings_don_t_work_researchers_say>  So therefore we'll keep this as AC:M and impact=critical   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c13)  Elio Maldonado Batiz    2009-07-28 15:33:40 UTC  ``` In the upstream patch for Firefox, as well in more current versions of NSS shipped with RHEL 4 and 5, the  NSS_USE_SHEXP_IN_CERT_NAME environment variable is checked. If set, the code reverts to the old way of checking for backward compatibility. If not set, which is the default, it then follows the RFC 2818 approach which fixes the problem. On RHEL-3 we can't count on NSS_USE_SHEXP_IN_CERT_NAME so this patch follows the RFC 2818 approach always thus fixing the problem. This patch is only required for RHEL-3.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c18)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-30 21:54:49 UTC  ``` Updating [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c11), Moxie found it was possible to get such a certificate signed by a CA.  Although the CA is likely to no longer issue certificates with nulls (and each attempt of your shellcode would require a new signed certificate), it may well be possible to use this attack without the need for the user to accept a certificate manually.  This is already rated impact=critical, so no change to the rating.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c19)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-30 21:56:08 UTC  ``` This issue was presented by MOXIE last night at Black Hat and is outlined in the public slides:         <http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-09/MARLINSPIKE/BHUSA09-Marlinspike-DefeatSSL-SLIDES.pdf>  Therefore removing embargo   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-30 22:10:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1184 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1184.html>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-30 22:19:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3  Via RHSA-2009:1185 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1185.html>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-30 22:20:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1186 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1186.html>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-31 14:31:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.7 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2009:1190 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1190.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=512912#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-12 14:31:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 Z Stream  Via RHSA-2009:1207 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1207.html>   ``` |  |
