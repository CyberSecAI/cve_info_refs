Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-2754:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper signedness check on a supplied parameter size within the RPC protocol parsing library `librpc.dll`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The lack of a signedness check allows an attacker to manipulate the size parameter, leading to an exploitable stack-based buffer overflow.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The vulnerability is a result of a missing input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **SYSTEM User Context:** The code execution occurs under the context of the SYSTEM user, granting the attacker high-level privileges on the compromised machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered through network communication via the RPC protocol used by the ISM Portmapper service.
*   **Specific Service:** The ISM Portmapper service (portmap.exe) listens on TCP port 36890, which is the entry point for the exploit.
*   **No User Interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted RPC requests to the vulnerable service (port 36890).
*   **Knowledge of RPC Protocol:**  The attacker would need knowledge of the RPC protocol used by the affected service in order to craft a malicious request.

**Affected Products:**

*   IBM Informix Dynamic Server
*   EMC Legato Networker

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor in February 2008, and a coordinated public release happened in March 2010.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via a filter ID (5945).
*   IBM released fixes for the issue in IDS 10.00.TC9 and 11.10.TC3, with recommended fix pack versions 10.00.TC10 and 11.10.TC3.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Sebastian Apelt.
