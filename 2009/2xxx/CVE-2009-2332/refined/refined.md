{
  "Root cause": "The application improperly handles user-supplied input in several PHP files.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities in `index.php`, `admin/admin_edit.php`, and `admin/admin_menu.php` due to insufficient input sanitization when including files.",
    "Arbitrary File Deletion vulnerability in `admin/admin_delete.php` due to lack of sanitization when deleting files.",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `admin/admin_menu.php` by injecting malicious code via the `menu` parameter.",
    "Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability through file inclusion and manipulation in `admin/admin_menu.php`, `/admin_settings.php`, and `/admin_new.php` by injecting PHP code into included files or settings.",
    "Path Disclosure vulnerability by requesting non-existent files."
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, delete files, inject malicious code (XSS), achieve remote code execution, and gain information about the server's filesystem.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests with crafted `id` parameters to exploit LFI in `index.php` and `admin/admin_edit.php`.",
    "HTTP GET request with a crafted `id` parameter to exploit arbitrary file deletion in `/admin/admin_delete.php`.",
     "HTTP POST requests with a crafted `menu` parameter to exploit LFI/XSS/RCE in `/admin/admin_menu.php`.",
    "HTTP POST request with crafted `tmpl`, `id`, and `menu` parameters to exploit RCE in `/admin_settings.php`.",
   "HTTP POST request with crafted `title` parameter to exploit RCE in `/admin_new.php`."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to send crafted HTTP GET or POST requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerabilities in some cases. Some exploits require administrator access."
