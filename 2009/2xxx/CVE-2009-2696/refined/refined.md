    *   Phishing attacks
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the vulnerable "examples calendar" application of Apache Tomcat.
*   An attacker could craft a malicious URL or inject code through user input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
