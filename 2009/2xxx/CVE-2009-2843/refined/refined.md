Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2843:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from improper handling of expired certificates in Java applets. Specifically, the system incorrectly treats expired certificates as valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is the failure to validate the validity period of X.509 certificates used by Java applets. This leads to a bypass of certificate revocation and integrity checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to run malicious Java applets, even if they are signed with an expired certificate. This could enable arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the current user, compromising the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through a malicious web page hosting a Java applet signed with an expired certificate. The user would have to visit such a page for the exploitation to take place.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to:
  - Create a malicious Java applet.
  - Sign the applet with an expired certificate.
  - Host this applet on a website or find a way to inject it into a site visited by the target user.
  - Be able to get the victim to visit a page that uses the applet.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of expired certificates for Java applets, allowing a malicious actor to bypass security measures and potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting this vulnerability. The exploitation requires the victim to visit a website containing the malicious applet.
