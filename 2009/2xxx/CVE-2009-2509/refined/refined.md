Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-2509:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the incorrect validation of request headers by Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) when an authenticated user connects to an ADFS-enabled web server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** ADFS does not properly validate request headers submitted by authenticated clients.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Full System Control:** The attacker can gain complete control over the compromised system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can perform actions on the IIS server with the same rights as the Worker Process Identity (WPI), which by default has Network Service account privileges. If the application pool is configured with an account having administrative privileges, the impact could be even more severe.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to an ADFS-enabled web server.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the ADFS server to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs valid logon credentials to the vulnerable server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the ADFS-enabled web server.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects ADFS-enabled web servers and does not directly affect client systems.
* The provided content indicates the vulnerability was not publicly disclosed and Microsoft had not received any reports of active exploitation at the time of the security bulletin's release.
* The provided content also clarifies that this vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2009-2508, which concerns a spoofing vulnerability in ADFS single sign-on.
