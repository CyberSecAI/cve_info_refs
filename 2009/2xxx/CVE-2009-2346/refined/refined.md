{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The IAX2 protocol uses a 15-bit fixed size field for call numbers. When all call numbers are exhausted, no new sessions can be handled.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Resource exhaustion due to the fixed size of the call number field in the IAX2 protocol. Lack of handshake before call number assignment allows spoofed source IP attacks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting all available call numbers, preventing legitimate users from establishing new IAX2 sessions.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a large number of IAX2 messages to consume the available call number space.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with the ability to send IAX2 messages to the target system. No authentication is required."
