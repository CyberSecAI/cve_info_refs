Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2009-006

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | IAX2 Call Number Resource Exhaustion |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Denial of Service |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote unauthenticated sessions |
| **Severity** | Major |
| **Exploits Known** | Yes - Published by Blake Cornell < blake AT remoteorigin DOT com > on voip0day.com |
| **Reported On** | June 22, 2008 |
| **Reported By** | Noam Rathaus < noamr AT beyondsecurity DOT com >, with his SSD program, also by Blake Cornell |
| **Posted On** | September 3, 2009 |
| **Last Updated On** | September 3, 2009 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Russell Bryant < russell AT digium DOT com > |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2009-2346 |

| **Description** | The IAX2 protocol uses a call number to associate messages with the call that they belong to. However, the protocol defines the call number field in messages as a fixed size 15 bit field. So, if all call numbers are in use, no additional sessions can be handled.    A call number gets created at the start of an IAX2 message exchange. So, an attacker can send a large number of messages and consume the call number space. The attack is also possible using spoofed source IP addresses as no handshake is required before a call number is assigned. |

| **Resolution** | Upgrade to a version of Asterisk listed in this document as containing the IAX2 protocol security enhancements. In addition to upgrading, administrators should consult the users guide section of the IAX2 Security document (IAX2-security.pdf), as well as the sample configuration file for chan\_iax2 that have been distributed with those releases for assistance with new options that have been provided. |

| **Discussion** | A lot of time was spent trying to come up with a way to resolve this issue in a way that was completely backwards compatible. However, the final resolution ended up requiring a modification to the IAX2 protocol. This modification is referred to as call token validation. Call token validation is used as a handshake before call numbers are assigned to IAX2 connections.    Call token validation by itself does not resolve the issue. However, it does allow an IAX2 server to validate that the source of the messages has not been spoofed. In addition to call token validation, Asterisk now also has the ability to limit the amount of call numbers assigned to a given remote IP address.    The combination of call token validation and call number allocation limits is used to mitigate this denial of service issue.    An alternative approach to securing IAX2 would be to use a security layer on top of IAX2, such as DTLS [RFC4347] or IPsec [RFC4301]. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
