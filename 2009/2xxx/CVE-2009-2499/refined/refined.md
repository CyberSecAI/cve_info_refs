Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-2499:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Windows handles MP3 media files. Specifically, the component responsible for processing MP3 files doesn't properly handle specially crafted metadata within the MP3 file. This leads to memory corruption during playback.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper parsing of MP3 metadata.
- Remote code execution vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- Attackers could gain complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative rights.
- This control allows the attacker to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new user accounts with full privileges.
- Systems with user accounts with fewer user rights are less impacted, but can still be compromised.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs when a user opens a specially crafted MP3 file.
- Attackers can use websites that host malicious MP3 files or stream such content to exploit the vulnerability.
-  Compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content could contain malicious MP3 content.
- The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft malicious MP3 files containing specifically designed metadata.
- Ability to host the malicious MP3 file on a web server or distribute it via email or other means.
- Requires user interaction (opening the file/visiting a compromised website).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Windows Media Format Runtime which is used by Windows Media Player and other media applications.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows including Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2003, 2008.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin.
- Microsoft had not received any reports of this vulnerability being exploited before the release of the security bulletin.
- Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers mitigates the vulnerability when browsing untrusted websites.
- Workarounds are available that restrict access to wmvcore.dll and mf.dll, but they disable the media playing functionality of Windows.
