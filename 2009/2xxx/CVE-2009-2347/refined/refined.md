  "CVE-2009-2347": {
    "description": "Multiple integer overflows in inter-color spaces conversion tools in libtiff 3.8 through 3.8.2, 3.9, and 4.0 allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a TIFF image with large (1) width and (2) height values, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow in the (a) cvt_whole_image function in tiff2rgba and (b) tiffcvt function in rgb2ycbcr.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "Integer overflows when calculating the size of the buffer needed to process an image in `tiff2rgba` and `rgb2ycbcr` tools.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Integer Overflow",
           "Heap-based buffer overflow"

          "Maliciously crafted TIFF image file."
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "User interaction with the malicious image file by opening it with an application utilizing libtiff or using vulnerable tools.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in the `cvt_whole_image` function in `tiff2rgba.c` and `tiffcvt` function in `rgb2ycbcr.c` . These functions fail to properly validate the width and height parameters of the input image leading to integer overflow when calculating the buffer size."
