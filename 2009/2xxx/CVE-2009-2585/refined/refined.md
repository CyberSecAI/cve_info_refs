{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the insecure handling of user IDs within the application's cookie. The application uses the `member` cookie, which is base64 encoded and contains the user ID, username, and a password hash. The user ID is directly concatenated with a SQL injection payload without proper sanitization before being used in a SQL query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Blind SQL Injection",
       "Insecure cookie handling",
      "Lack of input sanitization",
      "Direct use of user-controlled data in SQL queries"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords of administrators (mlffat_moderators table). This could lead to complete compromise of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP requests. The attacker crafts a malicious `member` cookie with a SQL injection payload in the user ID field and sends it to the server. The server then uses this unsanitized user ID within a SQL query.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL, a valid user ID, a valid username and a password to be used to create the cookie. The attacker also needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a crafted cookie. A basic understanding of SQL injection is required to craft the injection payload. The provided exploit code does not require prior knowledge of table names or schema."
