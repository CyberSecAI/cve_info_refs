#### I. Background

Quoting Wikipedia "ECMAScript is a scripting language, standardized by Ecma
International in the ECMA-262 specification and ISO/IEC 16262. The language
is widely used on the web, especially in the form of its three best-known
dialects, JavaScript, ActionScript, and JScript."
#### II. Description

Calling the select() method with a large integer, results in continuous
allocation of x+n bytes of memory exhausting memory after a while.

The impact varies from null pointer dereference (no more memory,hence
crashing the browser) to the reboot of the complete Operation System
(Konqueror&Ubuntu).

There had never been a limit specified as to how many html elements the select call should handle, after the report of this Bug, vendors apparently agreed to a
limit of 10.000 elements : "Talked to some Apple and Opera guys at the
WHATWG social, and we decided this was a good number"

#### III. Impact

The impact
varies from browser to browser and sometimes from OS to OS

* Konqueror (Ubuntu)- allocates 2GB of memory then either crashes
  the Browser or (most often) the OS reboots. Ubuntu's memory
  management system is configured as to NOT stop the process that consumes
  too much memory, but a random process. This sometimes leads to
  processes that are vital for the OS to be killed, hence the reboot.
  I am not kidding. Thanks to 'FX' for the memory management hint.
* Chrome : allocates 2GB of memory then crashes tab with a null pointer
* Firefox : allocates 2GB of memory then the Browser crashes
* IE5,6,7,8 : allocates 2GB of memory then the Browser crashes
* Opera : Allocated and commits as much memory as available,
  will not crash but other applications will become unstable
* Nintento WII (Opera) : Console hangs, needs hard reset

  **Video:** <http://vimeo.com/2937101> (Thanks to David Raison)
* Sony PS3 - Console hangs, needs hard reset

  **Video:** <http://vimeo.com/2937101> (Thanks to Chris Gates)
* iPhone - iPhone hangs and needs hard reset

  **Video:** <http://vimeo.com/2873339> (Thanks to g0tcha)
* Aigo P8860 (Browser hangs and cannot be restarted)

#### IV. Proof of concept

<script>

function poc(o) {

e = document.createElement("select");

e.length=2147483647;

}

function go() {

poc(0);

}

</script>

URL: http://www.crashthisthing.com/select.html

Some have not understood what this code does, it does NOT loop as some vendors
claimed, it just calls select.lenght() ONCE with a huge integer. One might wonder
if over the 9 last years that this bug existed, nobody ever entered a large
number in a select.lenght() call.

#### V. Disclosure timeline

Nothing particular to note.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I. Background
~~~~~~~~~~~
Quoting Wikipedia "ECMAScript is a scripting language, standardized by Ecma
International in the ECMA-262 specification and ISO/IEC 16262. The language
is widely used on the web, especially in the form of its three best-known
dialects, JavaScript, ActionScript, and JScript."

II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Calling the select() method with a large integer, results in continuos
allocation of x+n bytes of memory  exhausting memory after a while.
The impact varies from null pointer dereference (no more memory,hence
crashing the browser) to the reboot of the complete Operation System
(Konqueror&Ubuntu)

There had never been a limit specified as to how many html elements the select
call should handle, after the report of this Bug, vendors apparently agreed to a
limit of 10.000 elements : "Talked to some Apple and Opera guys at the
WHATWG social, and we decided this was a good number"

III. Impact
~~~~~~~~~
The Impact varies from Browser to Browser and from OS to OS.

Here is a small excerpt:
- Konqueror (Ubuntu)- allocates 2GB of memory then either crashes
the Browser or (most often) the OS reboots. Ubuntu's memory
management system appears to be configured as to NOT stop the process
that consumes too much memory, but a random process.
This sometimes leads to processes that are vital for the OS to
be killed, hence the reboot. I am not kidding. Thanks to
'FX' for Memory management hint.

- Chrome :  allocates 2GB of memory then crashes tab with a null pointer

- Firefox : allocates 2GB of memory then the Browser crashes

- IE5,6,7,8 : allocates 2GB of memory then the Browser crashes

- Opera : Allocated and commits as much memory as available,
will not crash but other applications will become unstable

- Nintento WII (Opera) : Console hangs, needs hard reset
Video: http://vimeo.com/2937101 (Thanks to David Raison)

- Sony PS3 - Console hangs, needs hard reset
Video: http://vimeo.com/2937101 (Thanks to Chris Gates)

- iPhone - iPhone hangs and needs hard reset
Video: http://vimeo.com/2873339 (Thanks to g0tcha)

- Aigo P8860 (Browser hangs and cannot be restarted)

IV. Proof of concept
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<script>
function poc(o) {
        e = document.createElement("select");
        e.length=2147483647;
}

function go() {
        poc(0);
}
</script>

URL: http://www.crashthisthing.com/select.html

Some have not understood what this code does, it does NOT loop as some vendors
claimed, it just calls select.lenght() ONCE with a huge integer. One might wonder
if over the 9 last years that this bug existed, nobody ever entered a large
number in a select.lenght() call.

IV. Disclosure timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nothing particular to note, except the usual discussion about availability being
a security issue.

V. Thanks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chris Gates, David Raison, Fahem Adam, a team of engineers that recognise themselves
and oCert for not helping coordinate this bug.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
