Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the IBM APAR PK77030, which is likely related to CVE-2009-2211:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies within the CQWeb server component of IBM Rational ClearQuest.  Specifically, there are two issues:
1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This indicates that the CQWeb server is not properly sanitizing user-supplied input before rendering it in web pages.
2. **Possible Username or Password Disclosure:** This suggests that sensitive information, such as usernames or passwords, might be exposed due to inadequate handling in the application, or in its logging practices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is a common web application vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
2. **Information Disclosure:** The potential disclosure of usernames or passwords is a serious information leakage issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1. **XSS:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to a variety of attacks including:
    * Session hijacking
    * Defacement of web pages
    * Redirecting users to malicious sites
    * Stealing cookies and other sensitive information
2. **Username/Password Disclosure:** This vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, data breaches, and complete compromise of the system, and the information it is intended to protect.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **XSS:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts through user input fields, parameters in URLs, or other vectors where user-supplied data is not properly escaped or validated by the web server.
2. **Username/Password Disclosure:** This could occur through various means, such as:
    * Improperly exposed logs
    * Unencrypted communication
    * Server vulnerabilities leaking memory information
    * Insufficient access control to data stores

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1. **XSS:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious input into the CQWeb server. This could be done via an authenticated user, or through an unauthenticated portion of the application.
2. **Username/Password Disclosure:** The attacker's required position depends on the exact cause of the disclosure. However, it could be a malicious authenticated user, or an attacker who had found an exposed sensitive data stream due to vulnerabilities elsewhere.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects IBM Rational ClearQuest versions 7.0.0.6, and 7.0.1.5 and prior.
* A fix is available in versions 7.0.0.6 and 7.0.1.5.
* The provided text appears to be an APAR (Authorized Program Analysis Report) from IBM. APARs are typically used to track and describe problems reported in IBM software.
