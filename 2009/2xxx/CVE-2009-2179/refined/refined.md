{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries or displaying it on a web page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to data breaches or modification. XSS can allow arbitrary script execution in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, phishing or malware distribution.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "The SQL injection vulnerability exists within the `search.php` script through the `sform[day]` parameter.",
     "The XSS vulnerability exists within the `website.php` script through the `page` parameter."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication or special access is needed to exploit these vulnerabilities."
