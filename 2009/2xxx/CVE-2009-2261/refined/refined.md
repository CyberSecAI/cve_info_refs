{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in how PeaZIP handles file entries within a compressed archive. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize filenames, allowing for command injection through specially crafted filenames.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability due to lack of proper sanitization of filenames within compressed archives.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system running PeaZIP by crafting a malicious zip file and tricking a user into opening and clicking on a file inside the archive. This could lead to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted ZIP archive containing malicious file names. When the user attempts to open the archive, the malicious filename will be parsed and the contained command executed by the OS.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious zip archive and entice a user to open it with a vulnerable version of PeaZIP. No specific network or system position is required."
