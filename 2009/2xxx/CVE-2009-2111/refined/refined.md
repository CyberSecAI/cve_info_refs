Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2111:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `add_reg.php` script of DB Top Sites 1.0. The script creates a PHP file (named after the user) and saves user data into it without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `location` field is vulnerable to code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization when processing the user-provided `location` data during registration. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into a file that's created on the server.
- **Remote Command Execution:** By injecting code like `";?><?php system($_GET['cmd']);?><?php $xxx=":D"`, the attacker can execute system commands via the `cmd` parameter in a subsequent request to the generated PHP file.
- **Insecure File Creation:** The script uses user-controlled input (`$user`) to define the filename, which can sometimes be a vulnerability on its own if path traversal is possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server with the privileges of the webserver user. This can lead to:
    - Data theft.
    - Server compromise.
    - Installation of malware.
    - Further attacks on internal networks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to `add_reg.php`, injecting malicious code into the `location` field.
- **HTTP GET Request:** After successful registration, the attacker sends a GET request to the generated PHP file (e.g., `sites/pwned.php`) including a `cmd` parameter with the desired system command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Understanding of Vulnerability:** The attacker must understand how the code injection vulnerability works to craft the necessary exploit requests.
- **Knowledge of Target's File System:**  While not required for basic command execution, knowing the target server's file system and directory structure might be useful for further actions like file uploads and access.
