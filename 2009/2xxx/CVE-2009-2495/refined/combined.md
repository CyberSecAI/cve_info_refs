# Microsoft Security Advisory 973882

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) Could Allow Remote Code Execution

Published: July 28, 2009 | Updated: October 13, 2009

**Version:** 4.0

Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about our ongoing investigation into vulnerabilities in the public and private versions of Microsoft's Active Template Library (ATL). This advisory also provides guidance as to what developers can do to help ensure that the controls and components they have built are not vulnerable to the ATL issues; what IT Professionals and consumers can do to mitigate potential attacks that use the vulnerabilities; and what Microsoft is doing as part of its ongoing investigation into the issue described in this advisory. This security advisory will also provide a comprehensive listing of all Microsoft Security Bulletins and Security Updates related to the vulnerabilities in ATL. Microsoft's investigation into the private and public versions of ATL is ongoing, and we will release security updates and guidance as appropriate as part of the investigation process.

Microsoft is aware of security vulnerabilities in the public and private versions of ATL. The Microsoft ATL is used by software developers to create controls or components for the Windows platform. The vulnerabilities described in this Security Advisory and Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131) could result in information disclosure or remote code execution attacks for controls and components built using vulnerable versions of the ATL. Components and controls created with the vulnerable version of ATL may be exposed to a vulnerable condition due to how ATL is used or due to issues in the ATL code itself.

**Developer Guidance:** Microsoft has corrected the issues in the public headers of ATL and released updates to the libraries in bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131) "Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution." Microsoft strongly recommends that developers who have built controls or components with ATL take immediate action to evaluate their controls for exposure to a vulnerable condition and follow the guidance provided to create controls and components that are not vulnerable. For more information on the vulnerabilities and guidance to address issues in ATL, see [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131), "Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution."

**IT Professional and Consumer Guidance:** To help better protect customers while developers update their components and controls, Microsoft has developed a new defense-in-depth technology. This new defense-in-depth technology built into Internet Explorer helps to protect customers from future attacks using the Microsoft Active Template Library vulnerabilities described in this Advisory and Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035. To benefit from this new defense-in-depth technology, IT Professionals and consumers should immediately deploy the Internet Explorer Security Update offered in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199), "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer."

This security update includes a mitigation that prevents components and controls built using the vulnerable ATL from being exploited in Internet Explorer, as well as addressing multiple unrelated vulnerabilities. The new defense-in-depth protections offered in MS09-034 include updates to Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8. These defense-in-depth protections monitor and help prevent the successful exploitation of all known public and private ATL vulnerabilities, including the vulnerabilities that could lead to bypassing ActiveX's kill bit security feature. These protections are designed to help protect customers from Web-based attacks.

**Home User Guidance:** To help better protect customers while developers update their components and controls, Microsoft has developed a new defense-in-depth technology. This new defense-in-depth technology built into Internet Explorer with the new update helps to protect customers from future attacks using the Microsoft Active Template Library vulnerabilities described in this Advisory and Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035. Home users signed up for Automatic Updates will receive the new Internet Explorer update automatically and do not have to take any further action. Home Users will automatically be better protected from future attacks against the vulnerabilities addressed in this Security Advisory and in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035.

**Mitigating Factors for Controls and Components built using vulnerable version of Microsoft's Active Template Library (ATL):**

* By default, the majority of ActiveX controls are not included in the default allow-list for ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer 7 or Internet Explorer 8 running on Windows Vista or later operating systems. Only customers who have explicitly approved vulnerable controls by using the ActiveX opt-in feature are at risk to attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, if a customer has used such ActiveX controls in a previous version of Internet Explorer, and then later upgraded to Internet Explorer 7 or Internet Explorer 8, then these ActiveX controls are enabled to work in Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8, even if the customer has not explicitly approved it using the ActiveX opt-in feature.
* By default, Internet Explorer 8 offers enhanced protections by enabling DEP/NX memory protections for users on Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Vista Service Pack 2, and Windows 7.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**Updates related to ATL:**

Update released on October 13, 2009

* Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-060](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=160633), "Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) ActiveX Controls for Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution," provides support for Microsoft Office components that are affected by the ATL vulnerabilities described in this advisory.

* Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131), "Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution," is being rereleased to offer new updates for developers who use Visual Studio to create components and controls for mobile applications using ATL for Smart Devices.

Updates released on July 28, 2009

* Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131), "Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution," goes into further detail about the specific vulnerabilities in ATL and provides the updated public ATL headers for vendors to develop updated components and controls. Our investigation has shown that there are Microsoft and third-party components and controls that are affected by this issue and that these components and controls exist on all supported editions of Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. Developers who used vulnerable versions of the ATL when building controls or components should review this bulletin and take immediate action if their controls are vulnerable.
* Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199), "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer," includes a mitigation that prevents components and controls built using the vulnerable ATL from being exploited in Internet Explorer, as well as addressing multiple unrelated vulnerabilities. The new defense in depth protections offered in MS09-034 include updates to Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8. These defense-in-depth protections monitor and help prevent the successful exploitation of all known public and private ATL vulnerabilities, including the vulnerabilities that could lead to bypassing ActiveX's kill bit security feature. These protections are designed to help protect customers from Web-based attacks.
* We are not aware of any methods or controls included with Windows 7 that would allow attacks to be successful through Internet Explorer.

Update released on July 14, 2009

* Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-032](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms09-032), "Cumulative Security Update of ActiveX Kill Bits," provided ActiveX security measures (a kill bit) that prevented the msvidctl control from running in Internet Explorer. The exploit in msvidcntl took advantage of a vulnerability in the private version of ATL. In this specific instance, the vulnerability allows an attacker to corrupt memory, which may lead to a remote code execution. The kill bits issued in the June release for msvidctl (MS09-032) will block the public exploits as described here.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the scope of the advisory?**

Microsoft is aware of vulnerabilities affecting components and controls built using public and private versions of the Active Template Library (ATL). The advisory aims to make users aware of updates that help mitigate the risk of vulnerable controls and components, provide guidance and direction to developers who have built controls and components using the vulnerable ATL, and to IT professionals on how to protect and install mitigations in their environment.

**Will Microsoft release additional security updates related to this Security Advisory in the future?**

Microsoft's investigation into the private and public headers of ATL is ongoing and we will release security updates and guidance as appropriate as part of the investigation process.

**Was the msvidctl vulnerability (MS09-032) related to this ATL update?**

Yes, the exploit in msvidctl took advantage of a vulnerability in the private version of ATL. In this specific instance, the vulnerability allows an attacker to corrupt memory, which may lead to a remote code execution. [MS09-032](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms09-032), previously issued in the July 14 release, blocks known attacks for msvidctl. For more information on the exploit in msvidctl, see <https://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/07/06/new-vulnerability-in-mpeg2tunerequest-activex-control-object-in-msvidctl-dll.aspx>.

**Will the Internet Explorer update (ms09-034) also protect against msvidctl attacks?**

Yes, the Internet Explorer mitigations will protect against the exploitation of the known vulnerabilities in the public and private versions of ATL, including the msvidctl attacks.

**What is ATL?**

The Active Template Library (ATL) is a set of template-based C++ classes that lets you create small, fast Component Object Model (COM) objects. ATL has special support for key COM features, including stock implementations, dual interfaces, standard COM enumerator interfaces, connection points, tear-off interfaces, and ActiveX controls. For more information, see the MSDN article, [ATL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3ax346b7%28vs.71%29.aspx).

**What causes this threat in ATL?**

The issue is caused in some cases by the way ATL is used, and in other cases by the ATL code itself. In these cases, data streams may be handled incorrectly, which can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, and instantiation of objects without regard to security policy. For more information on the vulnerabilities addressed in ATL, see [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131), "Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution."

**What are the differences between the public and private versions of the Active Template Library?**

The private version of the Active Template Library is used by Microsoft developers to build controls and components. Microsoft has updated all versions of the Active Template Library used by our developers.

The public version of the Active Template Library is distributed to customers through developer tools, such as Microsoft Visual Studio. Microsoft is providing an updated version of our public ATL through Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035.

**Will the security vulnerabilities in ATL require Microsoft and third-party developers to issue security updates?**

Yes. In addition to the bulletin updates described in this advisory, Microsoft is performing a comprehensive investigation of Microsoft controls and components. Upon completion of this investigation, Microsoft will take the appropriate action to help protect our customers. This may include providing a security update through our monthly release process or providing an out-of-band security update, depending on customer needs.

Microsoft is also providing guidance and is actively contacting major third-party developers to help them identify vulnerable controls and components. This may result in security updates for third party controls and components.

## Frequently Asked Questions about Windows Live Services

**How will the upgrade to Windows Live Messenger be distributed?**

Upon signing on to Windows Live Messenger service, users of Windows Live Messenger 8.1, Windows Live Messenger 8.5, and Windows Live Messenger 14.0 on supported releases of Windows will be prompted by the client deployment mechanism in the Windows Live Messenger service to accept the upgrade to Windows Live Messenger 14.0.8089. Also, users who desire to download the upgrade to Windows Live Messenger 14.0.8089 immediately may do so by using the [Windows Live Download Center](https://download.live.com/messenger). Otherwise, users of vulnerable versions of the Windows Live Messenger clients may not be allowed to connect to the Windows Live Messenger service.

**Why is Microsoft releasing the upgrade to Windows Live Messenger over the Windows Live Messenger service as well as providing downloads?**

Microsoft currently issues upgrades for the Windows Live Messenger client using the Windows Live Messenger service because these online services have their own client deployment mechanism. However, Microsoft Download Center links are also available for specific Windows Live Messenger clients. Users who desire to download the upgrades immediately may do so at the [Windows Live Download Center](https://download.live.com/messenger).

**If this is an upgrade, how can I detect if I have a vulnerable version of Windows Live Messenger?**

When you attempt to sign on to the Windows Live Messenger service, the client deployment mechanism will automatically determine your current client version and platform and if required, recommend the appropriate upgrade. Also, you may verify your Windows Live Messenger client version by clicking **Help** and then **About**.

**What happens if I do not upgrade to the most current version of Windows Live Messenger?**

If you do not upgrade to a non-affected version of the Windows Live Messenger client, depending on your platform, you will be notified to upgrade on each attempt to sign on. If you do not accept the upgrade, you may not be allowed access to Windows Live Messenger service.

**Are other Microsoft Real-Time Collaboration applications, like Windows Messenger or Office Communicator, affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Other messaging applications are not affected as they do not contain the vulnerable component.

**When did Microsoft remove the Windows Live Hotmail "Attach Photo" feature? Did it coincide with the launch of another new feature?**

Microsoft recently made the decision to remove the feature on a short-term basis in order to fix the issue. The temporary removal of this feature did not coincide with the launch of another feature.

**What is latest timetable for the "Attach Photo" feature to be fully restored to all Windows Live Hotmail users?**

Microsoft is actively working to correct the problem. In the meantime, you are still able to add pictures as attachments to your Hotmail messages by clicking **Attach**, and then selecting the picture you want to include.

## Frequently Asked Questions from Developers about the Visual Studio Update

**What causes this threat in ATL?**

The issue is caused in some cases by the way ATL is used, and in other cases by the ATL code itself. In these cases, data streams may be handled incorrectly, which can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, and instantiation of objects without regard to security policy. For more information on the vulnerabilities addressed in ATL, see [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131), "Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution."

**What might an attacker use this vulnerability to do?**

For controls and components built using ATL, unsafe usage of certain macros could allow the instantiation of arbitrary objects that can bypass related ActiveX security policy (i.e. kill bits) within Internet Explorer. Additionally, components and controls built using the vulnerable version of ATL may be vulnerable to remote code execution or information disclosure threats. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, and they have a vulnerable control on their system, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**I am a third-party application developer and I use ATL in my component or control. Is my component or control vulnerable, and if so, how do I update it?**

Components and controls may be affected by this issue if certain conditions are met during the building of the component or control. [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131) contains additional information, examples, and guidance that third-party developers can use to detect and correct vulnerable components and controls.

**What does the Security Update for Visual Studio do?**

These updates address vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) that could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to run arbitrary code on an affected system. These vulnerabilities are in some cases caused by the way that ATL is used, and in other cases by the ATL code itself. Since these vulnerabilities affect ATL, components or controls that were developed using ATL may expose customers using the affected controls and components to remote code execution scenarios.

The security update for Visual Studio updates the vulnerable version of the ATL used by Visual Studio. This allows Visual Studio users to modify and re-build their controls and components using an updated version of the ATL.

Our investigation has shown that both Microsoft and third-party components and controls may be affected by this issue. Therefore, all affected vendors must modify, and rebuild, their components and controls using the corrected ATL provided in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131).

## Frequently Asked Questions from IT Professionals about what they can do to protect themselves

**Does the IE update MS09-034 protect me from all components and controls that were built on the vulnerable version of ATL?**

To help better protect customers while developers update their components and controls, Microsoft has developed a new defense-in-depth technology. This new defense-in-depth technology built into Internet Explorer helps to protect customers from future attacks using the Microsoft Active Template Library vulnerabilities described in this Advisory and in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035. Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199), "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer," includes a mitigation that prevents components and controls built using the vulnerable ATL from being exploited in Internet Explorer, as well as addressing multiple unrelated vulnerabilities.

Microsoft is continuing to investigate all Microsoft controls and components and is helping third party developers evaluate their controls and components.

**What action can an IT professional take to mitigate exposure to this issue?**

Microsoft strongly recommends that IT professionals immediately deploy the Internet Explorer Security Update offered in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199), "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer."

## Frequently Asked Questions about what Consumers can do to protect themselves

**What action can consumers take to mitigate exposure to this issue?**

To help better protect customers while developers update their components and controls, Microsoft has developed a new defense-in-depth technology. This new defense-in-depth technology built into Internet Explorer helps to protect customers from future attacks using the Microsoft Active Template Library vulnerabilities described in this Advisory and in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035. Microsoft strongly recommends that consumers turn on [Automatic Update](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windowsupdate/automaticupdate.mspx) and immediately deploy the Internet Explorer Security Update offered in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199), "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer." Home users who receive updates automatically will receive the mitigations provided in the cumulative IE update and other security updates related to this issue, and do not have to take further action.

Microsoft also encourages Home users to upgrade to [Internet Explorer 8](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/worldwide-sites.aspx) to benefit from enhanced security and protections.

## Frequently asked Questions about the mitigations in Internet Explorer Update

**What causes this threat which could allow the bypass of ActiveX security?**

ActiveX controls built with vulnerable ATL methods may not correctly validate information. This could result in an ActiveX control that allows memory corruption, or allows an attacker to leverage a trusted ActiveX control to load an un-trusted ActiveX control that had been previously blocked from running in Internet Explorer.

The new defense in depth protections offered in MS09-034 include updates to Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8, that monitor and prevent the successful exploitation of all known public and private ATL vulnerabilities, including the vulnerabilities that could lead to bypassing the IE kill bit security feature. These protections are designed to protect customers from Web-based attacks.

**What might an attacker use this function to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability on Windows Vista or Windows 2008 would only gain rights as a restricted user due to Protect Mode in Internet Explorer. On other Windows systems, the attacker could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an Attacker use this function?**

An attacker could host a Web site that is designed to host a specially crafted ActiveX control and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an instant messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**What is a kill bit?**

A security feature in Microsoft Internet Explorer makes it possible to prevent an ActiveX control from being loaded by the Internet Explorer HTML-rendering engine. This is done by making a registry setting and is referred to as "setting the kill bit." After the kill bit is set, the control can never be loaded, even when it is fully installed. Setting the kill bit makes sure that even if a vulnerable component is introduced or is re-introduced to a system, it remains inert and harmless.

For more information on kill bits, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797): How to stop an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer. For more detailed information on kill bits and how they function within Internet Explorer see the following [Security Research and Defense](https://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2008/02/06/the-kill_2d00_bit-faq_3a00_-part-1-of-3.aspx) blog post.

**What does the update do?**

The update strengthens the ActiveX security mechanism by providing validation when unsafe methods are used by ActiveX controls using vulnerable ATL headers in specific configurations.

**Does this update change functionality?**

Yes. This update no longer allows specific sets of ATL methods to run within Internet Explorer. The update mitigates the risk of bypassing active security by preventing trusted ActiveX controls from loading un-trusted controls

**Does this update contain additional software changes?**

Yes. This update also contains additional security fixes and other updates to Internet Explorer as part of the cumulative update for Internet Explorer.

**Does this update address all unsafe ActiveX control scenarios?**

No. This update specifically addresses unsafe/un-trusted ActiveX controls that may be vulnerable to the ATL issues described in this Advisory to protect customers from attack when browsing the Internet.

Microsoft is continuing to investigate this issue. Upon completion of this investigation, Microsoft will take the appropriate action to help protect our customers. This may include providing a security update through our monthly release process or providing an out-of-band security update, depending on customer needs.

**How does Protected Mode in Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Vista and later protect me from this vulnerability?**

Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Vista and later operating systems run in [Protected Mode](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/ie7-protected-mode.aspx) by default in the Internet security zone. Protected Mode significantly reduces the ability of an attacker to write, alter, or destroy data on the userâs machine or to install malicious code. This is accomplished by using the integrity mechanisms of Windows Vista and later, which restrict access to processes, files, and registry keys with higher integrity levels.

**What is Data Execution Prevention (DEP)?**

Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is enabled by default in Internet Explorer 8. DEP is designed to help foil attacks by preventing code from running in memory that is marked non-executable. For more information about DEP in Internet Explorer, please see the following post: [https://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/04/08/ie8-security-part-I\_3A00\_-dep-nx-memory-protection.aspx](https://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/04/08/ie8-security-part-i_3a00_-dep-nx-memory-protection.aspx).

If you have Automatic Updates enabled, the updates are delivered to you when they are released, but you have to make sure you install them.

#### Workarounds

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. Although these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

#### Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones

You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High.**

To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to **High**.

**Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High.**

**Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High.**

**Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

**Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

To accomplish this, follow these steps:

1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

**Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone

You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
2. Click the **Security** tab.
3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt**or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

**Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) ActiveX Controls for Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (973965)

Published: October 13, 2009 | Updated: February 17, 2010

**Version:** 1.5

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in ActiveX Controls for Microsoft Office that were compiled with a vulnerable version of Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL). The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user loaded a specially crafted component or control. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Outlook 2002, Microsoft Office Outlook 2003, Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, Microsoft Visio 2002 Viewer, Microsoft Office Visio 2003 Viewer, and Microsoft Office Visio Viewer 2007. For more information on the software affected by this update, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the manner in which ATL handles the instantiation of objects from data streams, providing updated versions of the affected components and controls built using corrected ATL headers. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 973965](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/973965) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

Yes, the update package for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 and Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 Service Pack 2 (KB972363) includes the changes to Outlook 2007 described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 969907](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/969907).

**Why are KB974554, KB974556, and KB974234 not listed in this security bulletin?**

The update associated with Microsoft Knowledge Base articles 974554, 974556, and 974234 is not a security update and does not correct any security-related issues. However, the update resolves a problem that can cause programs that use Outlook View Control with Forms 2.0, such as Microsoft Office Outlook with Business Contact Manager, to stop functioning as expected after applying the MS09-060 security update. Microsoft encourages customers who use Outlook View Control with Forms 2.0 to apply the update available from KB974554, KB974556, or KB974234, depending on your version of Microsoft Office, after installing the MS09-060 security update. Customers who do not use Outlook View Control with Forms 2.0 will not require the KB974554, KB974556, or KB974234 update.

**Why are KB974554, KB974556, and KB974234 labeled as Security Updates, when they contain no security-related fixes?**

The KB974554, KB974556, and KB974234 update resolves a known issue with the Outlook security update for MS09-060. Even though the KB974554, KB974556, and KB974234 update does not correct any security-related issues, KB974554, KB974556, and KB974234 are listed as Security Updates on Microsoft Update, Windows Update, Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server, and by Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), due to patching requirements on certain platforms for updates resolving any post-installation issues with Outlook security updates that are necessary to make sure that the Outlook security updates work correctly. You do not have to install the known issue update if you do not install the Outlook security update. However, we recommend that customers install the MS09-060 security update if they plan to deploy Outlook in the future.

**I do not have Microsoft Outlook installed. Why am I being offered the known issue update for KB974554, KB974556, or KB974234?**

The known issue update for KB974554, KB974556, and KB974234 is being offered to most users of Microsoft Office, including users who do not have Outlook installed, because the MS09-060 security update affects a component that is used by most Microsoft Office products. It is not technically possible to reliably detect which of these users are using the Outlook View Control, so the known issue update for Outlook View Control is offered to all Microsoft Office users. Each user should determine whether the update is relevant to their environment based on their use of the Outlook View Control and Forms 2.0.

**Where can I get the Outlook View Control with Forms 2.0 known issue update for KB974554, KB974556, or KB974234?**

## ATL Uninitialized Object Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0901

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) due to an issue in the ATL headers that could allow an attacker to force VariantClear to be called on a VARIANT that has not been correctly initialized. Because of this, the attacker can control what happens when VariantClear is called during handling of an error by supplying a corrupt stream. This vulnerability only directly affects systems with components and controls installed that were built using Visual Studio ATL. This issue could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0901](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0901).

#### Mitigating Factors for ATL Uninitialized Object Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0901

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.

#### Workarounds for ATL Uninitialized Object Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0901

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for ATL Uninitialized Object Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0901

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability only directly affects systems with vulnerable components and controls installed that were built using affected versions of Microsoft's ATL.

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. For example, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution if the user visits a specially crafted Web page with Internet Explorer that instantiates a vulnerable component or control. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is due to an issue in the ATL headers that could allow an attacker to call VariantClear() on a variant that has not been correctly initialized. For developers who created a component or control using ATL in this manner, the resulting component or control could allow remote code execution in the context of the logged on user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

If a user has a vulnerable control on their system and an attacker bypasses the mitigations described in [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882), then an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer by attempting to exploit a vulnerable control, and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have to discover a vulnerable control, and force users to visit these Web sites. To do this, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who should not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the issue by ensuring VariantClear() can only be called on initialized variants, and provides updated versions of ATL that allow developers to address this issue in potentially vulnerable controls.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## ATL COM Initialization Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2493

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) due to issues in the ATL headers that handle instantiation of an object from data streams. This vulnerability only directly affects systems with components and controls installed that were built using Visual Studio ATL. For components and controls built using ATL, unsafe usage of OleLoadFromStream could allow the instantiation of arbitrary objects which can bypass related security policy, such as kill bits within Internet Explorer. This issue could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-2493](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2493).

* V1.5 (February 17, 2010): Corrected the MBSA detection entries for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 and Microsoft Office Visio Viewer 2007. This is an information change only. There were no changes to the security update files or detection logic.

# Microsoft Updates for Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedJanuary 24, 2013
Alert CodeTA09-195A

### Systems Affected

* Microsoft Windows and Windows Server
* Microsoft DirectShow
* Microsoft Virtual PC and Server
* Microsoft Office Publisher
* Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server

### Overview

Microsoft has released updates that address vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, DirectShow, Virtual PC and Server, Office Publisher, and ISA Server.

As part of the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for July 2009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-jul.mspx), Microsoft has released updates that address several vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, DirectShow, Windows Virtual PC and Server, Office Publisher, and ISA Server. Microsoft indicates that two of these vulnerabilities, [CVE-2009-1537](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1537) and [CVE-2008-0015](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0015), are being actively exploited.

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code, gain elevated privileges, or cause a vulnerable application to crash.

### Solution

Microsoft has provided updates for these vulnerabilities in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for July 2009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-jul.mspx). The security bulletin describes any known issues related to the updates. Administrators are encouraged to note these issues and test for any potentially adverse effects. Administrators should consider using an automated update distribution system such as Windows Server Update Services ([WSUS](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/wsus/default.aspx)).

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035 - Moderate

## Vulnerabilities in Visual Studio Active Template Library Could Allow Remote Code Execution (969706)

Published: July 28, 2009 | Updated: January 12, 2010

**Version:** 3.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update addresses several privately reported vulnerabilities in the public versions of the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) included with Visual Studio. This security update is specifically intended for developers of components and controls. Developers who build and redistribute components and controls using ATL should install the update provided in this bulletin and follow the guidance provided to create, and distribute to their customers, components and controls that are not vulnerable to the vulnerabilities described in this security bulletin.

This security bulletin discusses vulnerabilities that could allow remote code execution if a user loaded a component or control built with the vulnerable versions of ATL.

While most Microsoft Security Bulletins discuss the risk of a vulnerability for a specific product, this security bulletin discusses the vulnerabilities that may be present in products built using the ATL. Therefore, this security update is rated Moderate for all supported editions of Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003, Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Package, and Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package.

For more information on the impact of, and workarounds and mitigations for controls and components that may be vulnerable to these issues, please see [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882).

For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the ATL headers so that components and controls built using the headers can safely initialize from a data stream. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Developers who have built components and controls using ATL should download this update and recompile their components and controls following the guidance provided in the following [MSDN article](https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9674481).

The majority of Visual Studio customers who have automatic updating enabled will receive this update automatically and receive the updated ATL. However, as noted earlier, additional steps will be needed to update potentially vulnerable controls and components. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 969706](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/969706) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

For more information on this known issue, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 969706](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/969706).

**Why was this bulletin revised on August 4, 2009?**

This bulletin was revised to communicate that the **Known issues with this security update** section in the associated [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 969706](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/969706) been revised, and that the update detection logic for KB973923 and KB973924 has been revised to correct a package re-offering issue. The original detection logic determined whether the update needed to be installed by checking to confirm that the update was not already installed. The Visual C++ Redistributable packages (KB973544, KB973551, KB973552), available from the Microsoft Download Center, are a full superset of the corresponding ATL update packages (KB973923, KB973924), available from Microsoft Update only. Customers who have installed the updated version of the Visual C++ Redistributable package do not need to install the corresponding ATL update packages. The detection changes account for this and do not re-offer the ATL Update packages when the corresponding fixed version of the Visual C++ Redistributable update is already installed. A new entry was also added to this **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update** section to clarify the difference between the Visual C++ Redistributable packages and the other Visual Studio updates. Enterprises that do not use Microsoft Update for deployment of updates that need to deploy the updates offered by this bulletin by some other means may download and deploy the full Visual C++ Redistributable packages since these are a full superset of the corresponding ATL update packages.

**What is the difference between the Visual C++ Redistributable packages and the other Visual Studio updates?**

The Visual C++ Redistributable packages are full versions of this product that can be redistributed by anyone with their applications. Customers who need to ship the Visual C++ Redistributable should pick up these packages and bundle them or chain them into their setups. The other Visual Studio updates are available for customers who have previously installed an older version of the Visual C++ Redistributable product or have installed the Visual Studio product. These update packages are offered to customers through Microsoft Update only and will be applicable only if an earlier version of the Visual C++ Redistributable or Visual Studio is present.

**Why do the Microsoft Download Center update KB numbers for Visual C++ Redistributable packages differ from the SMS, SCCM, WSUS and MU update KB numbers?**

The full versions of the fixed Visual C++ 2005 and 2008 redistributable packages (KB973544, KB973551, and KB973552) are listed on the Microsoft Download Center only as these are full new versions of the products. The updates listed on SMS, SCCM, WSUS, and MU (KB973923, KB9739234) are updates only for customers who have previously installed vulnerable versions of the Visual C++ redistributable packages. These updates are not the versions on the download center. Microsoft does not recommend customers redistribute any version other than the full versions that can be downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center (KB973544, KB973551, and KB973552).

**Why was this security update released out of band?**

This security update is being released out of band to address issues disclosed in [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882), "Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) Could Allow Remote Code Execution."

**Is this security update related to MS09-034, also released as an out-of-band update?**

Yes. Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199), "Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer," includes a mitigation that helps prevent components and controls built using the vulnerable ATL from being exploited in Internet Explorer, as well as addressing multiple unrelated vulnerabilities. The new defense in depth protections offered in MS09-034 include updates to Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8, that monitor and help prevent the successful exploitation of all known public and private ATL vulnerabilities, including the vulnerabilities that could lead to bypassing ActiveX's kill bit security feature. These protections are designed to help protect customers from Web-based attacks.

**If I have installed the MS09-034 update, do I still need to install this update?**

This security update is specifically intended for developers of components and controls. Developers who built or redistributed components and controls built with affected versions of the Active Template Library should install the update provided in this bulletin and follow the steps provided to ensure that their components and controls do not contain the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.

**If I have installed the MS09-034 update, do I still need to install additional components and controlsissued by Microsoft or third parties that address the vulnerabilities described in Microsoft Security Advisory 973882 and Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035?**

The [MS09-034](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199) Internet Explorer mitigation does not address the underlying vulnerabilities within certain components and controls developed with the Active Template Library. Microsoft recommends that developers follow the guidance provided in this bulletin to modify and rebuild all components and controls affected by vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**What is ATL?**

The Active Template Library (ATL) is a set of template-based C++ classes that let you create small, fast Component Object Model (COM) objects. It has special support for key COM features, including stock implementations, dual interfaces, standard COM enumerator interfaces, connection points, tear-off interfaces, and ActiveX controls. For more information, see the following [MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3ax346b7%28vs.71%29.aspx).

**Are third-party components and controls affected by this issue?**

Some third-party components and controls may be affected by this issue if certain conditions were met during the building of the components and controls. Microsoft recommends that developers follow the guidance provided in this bulletin to modify and rebuild all components and controls affected by vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.

**I am a third-party application developer and I use ATL in my components and controls. Are my components and controls vulnerable, and if so, how do I update them?**

For instructions on determining whether your components and controls are vulnerable and how to update them, see the following [MSDN Article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/ee309358.aspx).

## ATL Uninitialized Object Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0901

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) due to an issue in the ATL headers that could allow an attacker to force VariantClear to be called on a VARIANT that has not been correctly initialized. Because of this, the attacker can control what happens when VariantClear is called during handling of an error by supplying a corrupt stream. This vulnerability only directly affects systems with components and controls installed that were built using Visual Studio ATL. This issue could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0901](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-0901).

#### FAQ for ATL Uninitialized Object Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0901

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability only directly affects systems with vulnerable components and controls installed that were built using affected versions of Microsoft's ATL.

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. For example, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution if the user visits a specially crafted Web page with Internet Explorer that instantiates a vulnerable component or control. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results from an issue in the ATL headers that could allow an attacker to call VariantClear() on a variant that has not been correctly initialized. For developers who created a component or control using ATL in this manner, the resulting component or control could allow remote code execution in the context of the logged on user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

If a user has a vulnerable control on their system and an attacker bypasses the mitigations described in [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882), then an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer by attempting to exploit a vulnerable control, and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have to discover a vulnerable control, and force users to visit these Web sites. To do this, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who should not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the issue by ensuring VariantClear() can only be called on initialized variants, and provides updated versions of ATL that allow developers to address this issue in potentially vulnerable controls.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## ATL COM Initialization Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2493

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) due to issues in the ATL headers that handle instantiation of an object from data streams. This vulnerability only directly affects systems with components and controls installed that were built using Visual Studio ATL. For components and controls built using ATL, unsafe usage of OleLoadFromStream could allow the instantiation of arbitrary objects which can bypass related security policy, such as kill bits within Internet Explorer. This issue could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-2493](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2493).

## ATL Null String Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2495

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) that could allow a string to be read without a terminating NULL character. An attacker could manipulate this string to read extra data beyond the end of the string and thus disclose information in memory. This vulnerability only directly affects systems with components and controls installed that were built using Visual Studio ATL. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run a malicious component or control that could disclose information, forward user data to a third party, or access any data on the affected systems that was accessible to the logged-on user. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the âMicrosoft baseline Security Analyzerâ heading under the section, Microsoft Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
