Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2139:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the parsing of EMF (Enhanced Metafile) files within OpenOffice.org/Go-oo 2.x and 3.x. A flaw in the parser allows for a heap-based buffer overflow to occur when processing a specially crafted EMF file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** A crafted EMF file can trigger a buffer overflow in the heap, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org/Go-oo. This means an attacker could potentially take full control of a user's machine by having them open a specially crafted document.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted document:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker creating a malicious document containing a specially crafted EMF file.
*   **Remote attacker:** A remote attacker could distribute this document via various methods, such as email, malicious websites, or file-sharing platforms.
*   **User interaction required:** The user needs to open the malicious document with the vulnerable version of OpenOffice.org/Go-oo.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create crafted EMF files:** The attacker needs the technical ability to create or manipulate EMF files to trigger the buffer overflow vulnerability.
*   **Remote access to a vulnerable system:** The attacker needs to distribute the crafted document to a user who has a vulnerable version of OpenOffice.org/Go-oo installed.
*   **No special privileges required:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a user without requiring administrative or elevated privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to OpenOffice.org/Go-oo builds and doesn't affect the original OpenOffice.org builds from <http://www.openoffice.org/>.
*   The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2008-2238 but is specific to the ooo-build (Go-oo) variant.
*   The issue was introduced in the OpenOffice.org release based on ooo-build (Go-oo) version 2.1 and fixed in version 3.0.1.
*   There is no known workaround other than updating to the patched version.
