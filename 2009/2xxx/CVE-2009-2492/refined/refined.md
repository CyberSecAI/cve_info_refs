{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in Movable Type's mt-wizard.cgi script, allowing for the injection of arbitrary scripts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through user-supplied input, which is then rendered by the web browser.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to inject code into the vulnerable `mt-wizard.cgi` script. This is typically achieved by crafting a malicious URL or by supplying malicious content in a form field."
