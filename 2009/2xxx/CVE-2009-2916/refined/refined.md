- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The game uses the `CNS_AddTxt` function, which relies on `sprintf` for string formatting. This function is called in scenarios like when a player joins the server, where a timestamp is added to the player's name and then passed to `CNS_AddTxt`. The vulnerability arises because the `sprintf` function is used without proper format string specifiers, directly using input from the player's name.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Format string vulnerability. The `CNS_AddTxt` function in `logs.dll` uses `sprintf` with a fixed 1024-byte buffer without sanitizing input strings, leading to the format string vulnerability. Specifically, the function calls `sprintf` with user-controlled input.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server or client.

- **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation through in-game server interaction. The attacker can join a server with a crafted username that contains format string specifiers.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to join a server running a vulnerable version of the game and set their nickname.
