Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2881:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `index.php` file of the Basilic application. Specifically, the `idAuthor` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper input validation or sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing database queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This could potentially lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Reading sensitive information from the database.
    - Data modification: Modifying or deleting data within the database.
    - Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining elevated privileges within the database or underlying system if database user has sufficient permissions.
    - Denial of service: Causing database errors and application malfunction.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `idAuthor` parameter in the URL of the `index.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. There is no required level of authentication to exploit this vulnerability, making it remotely exploitable.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit is present in version 1.5.13 of Basilic.
- The exploit has been verified and assigned EDB-ID: 9246.
- Proof of concept URLs are provided which demonstrate the vulnerability.
- A Google dork is also included, which is useful for identifying vulnerable installations on the internet.
