# Re: SSL VPNs and security

Hello MZ,

I think SSL VPNs are a pretty lame idea in the first place, but for the
specific problem you bring up, would the following design work around
this?

Set up a wildcard record, *.webvpn.example.org, pointing to the device.
The device then maps all internal domain names or IP addresses to a
unique hostname, such as:  internalhost.webvpn.example.org, or
192-168-0-1.webvpn.example.org, etc.

Wouldn't this properly segment different internal sites, such that an
XSS in one wouldn't impact the other?  If so, pay attention all SSL VPN
vendors: it is your free idea for the week.

That depends on whether the solution tries to solve single-sign-on
problems as well.  If the vendor is trying to handle SSO in such an
environment, then they are probably using domain cookies.  The
problems are exactly the same as the ones Michal listed, plus some
additional ones specific to domain cookies.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# SSL VPNs and security

---

*From*: Michal Zalewski <lcamtuf () dione ids pl>

*Date*: Thu, 8 Jun 2006 22:48:18 +0200 (CEST)

---

```
"Web VPN" or "SSL VPN" is a term used to denote methods for accessing
company's internal applications with a bare WWW browser, with the use of
browser-based SSO authentication and SSL tunneling. As opposed to IPSec,
no additional software or configuration is required, and hence, corporate
users can use pretty much any computer they can put their hands on.

  [ Yes, this is a very bad idea, but often also a perceived business
    necessity. To counter the risk, some SSL VPN solutions may perform
    client-side security checks with the aid of an applet or control "not
    marked as safe". This is, of course, a silly and bypassable design,
    and has a side effect of teaching the user to click "yes" on
    scripting safety prompts. But I digress... ]

  [ These solutions are sold, among others, by Juniper, Nortel, Nokia,
    Cisco. The following observations are based on Cisco Web VPN (and your
    mileage with this and other vendors may vary).

In their most basic operating mode, SSL VPN systems simply act as a HTTPS
authentication and authorization proxy that relies on session cookies, and
a URI-based request rewriting and forwarding engine. Such a configuration
enables the user to access any HTTP or HTTPS based Intranet applications;
web-based clients for some other protocols are also sometimes included.

  [ With the help of various controls and applets again "not marked as
    safe", SSL VPNs can also forward local TCP ports through that tunnel,
    if unsupported network protocols need to be used. ]

A good example: let's say there's an user who wishes to access his
corporate Outlook Web Access interface from a remote location. The usual
URL for the intranet service is:

  <http://owa/exchange/lcamtuf/inbox>

To access it over the Internet, that fellow needs to navigate to
<https://webvpn.foocorp.com/>, enter his credentials, collect a session
cookie, and then go to (or be redirected to) something along the lines of:

  <https://webvpn.foocorp.com/http/0/owa/exchange/lcamtuf/inbox>

...which, if the cookie validates, would be translated to the original URL
and allowed to go through, with SSL VPN acting as a proxy.

Commercial SSL VPNs are a fairly recent technology that has a considerable
appeal to various corporations. Because of its novelty, however, in a
typical setup it may be subject to several serious security flaws, unless
very carefully designed.

Possibly the most important problem is that web VPNs break the customary
browser security model that relies on domain name separation for the
purpose of restricting access to cookies and other objects. Browsers
generally allow "foo.com" to interact with own cookies or windows, but
prevent the site from accessing resources related to "bar.com". Yet
through SSL VPN, they all may look the same:

  <https://webvpn.foocorp.com/http/0/foo.com/serious_work>
  <https://webvpn.foocorp.com/http/0/bar.com/fun_and_games>

Because of this design, all pages displayed through a Web VPN interface
are lumped together. Whenever a page (or just a HTML fragment) that can be
controlled by the attacker is displayed by *any* of the applications
behind Web VPN, Javascript can access:

  - Web VPN session cookie, which can be then passed to the attacker.
    This is equivalent to the attacker obtaining access to all protected
    systems and compromising Web VPN altogether. The threat could be
    mitigated by associating the cookie with client's IP, but such an
    approach is not always implemented, and is impractical with AOL and
    the likes.

  - Application cookies set by other applications. If passed to the
    browser (as some SSL VPNs do), these cookies are separated by the use
    of "path" parameter alone, which does not necessarily establish a
    browser security domain boundary. This is equivalent to the attacker
    obtaining user credentials to these applications.

Some commonly used corporate applications may indeed serve
attacker-supplied contents, making these attacks virtually inherent to
most SSL VPN deployments:

  - Various web mail systems, such as Outlook Web Access (OWA),
    may serve HTML attachments and other documents received from the
    Internet without providing an adequate browser warning. Although
    this is a security challenge by itself for all web mail interfaces
    (where there is a risk of stealing web mail session coookie),
    the access to all SSL VPN cookies make the impact far more serious.

  - Trivial cross-site scripting flaws in *any* available intranet
    application may compromise the entire SSL VPN. Because these
    applications are usually complex, aplenty, and all under-audited,
    existence of such bugs is pretty much a certainty.

  - Trivial cross-site scripting bug in SSL VPNs themselves may endanger
    the entire system. Impossible? Cisco SSL VPN has this:
    https://<vpnhost>/webvpn/dnserror.html?domain=<u>foo</u>
    (and yes, they seem to be aware of this, but have no specific
    timeline for fixing it - so I suppose it's OK to report it;
    hi Larry Seltzer).

  [ The possibility of allowing Internet access through Web VPN is
    something I wouldn't even consider here. ]

Additional problems may arise when SSL VPN gateway IP is added to "trusted
zone" for the purpose of making certain intranet applications work the way
they worked locally at the office.

Yes, these problems are hardly new, and can be mitigated with some very
careful design, and some vendors may be doing it properly - but I think
that the following needs to be said:

  - SSL VPNs may easily turn negligible and common security issues such as
    XSS into a considerable corporation-wide threat; and preventing this
    is hard.

  - Most SSL VPNs may be "secure by design" only in fairly unrealistic
    situations or limited uses.

  - Unless the vendor takes the effort to precisely and honestly explain
    how they mitigate these specific threats, it is safe to assume they
    might be not doing it properly (or not doing it at all).

Since these issues are generally not seriously discussed by vendors in
assessments of their products (say,
<http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/05_08_SSL-VPN-Security.html>),
I would assume that extreme caution needs to be exercised.

Flame on.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Clientless SSL VPN products break web browser domain-based security models

#### Vulnerability Note VU#261869

Original Release Date: 2009-11-30 | Last Revised: 2013-06-20

---

### Overview

Clientless SSL VPN products from multiple vendors operate in a way that breaks fundamental browser security mechanisms. An attacker could use these devices to bypass authentication or conduct other web-based attacks.

### Description

| Web browsers enforce the [same origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript) to prevent one site's active content (such as JavaScript) from accessing or modifying another site's data. For instance, active content hosted at http://<example.com>/page1.html can access DOM objects on http://<example.com>/page2.html, but cannot access objects hosted at http://<example.net>/page.html. Many clientless SSL VPN products retrieve content from different sites, then present that content as coming from the SSL VPN, effectively circumventing browser same origin restrictions.  Clientless SSL VPNs provide browser-based access to internal and external resources without the need to install a traditional VPN client. Typically, these web VPNs are used to access intranet sites (such as an internal webmail server), but many have more capabilities, such as providing access to internal fileshares and remote desktop capabilities. To connect to a VPN, a web browser is used to authenticate to the web VPN, then the web VPN retrieves and presents the content from the requested pages.Web VPN servers interact with clients using a process similar to what is described below:   1. The user presents credentials to the web VPN using a web browser. The authentication can be done through username and password submission, or can involve multi-factor authentication. 2. The web VPN authenticates the user and assigns an ID to the session, which is sent to the user's browser in the form of a cookie. 3. The user can then browse internal resources, such as a webmail server or intranet webserver. URLs as viewed by the user's web browser may be similar to https://<webvpnserver>/www.intranet.example.com.  As the web VPN retrieves web pages, it rewrites hyperlinks so that they are accessible through the web VPN. For example, a link to http://<www.intranet.example.com>/mail.html becomes https://<webvpnserver>/www.intranet.example.com/mail.html. Cookies set by the requested webserver may be converted into globally unique cookies before being passed to the user's browser, which prevents collision between two identically named cookies from different requested domains. For example, a sessionid cookie set by intranet.example.com could be renamed to intranet.example.com\_sessionid before it is sent from the web VPN to the user's browser . Additionally, the web VPN may replace references to specific HTML DOM objects, such as document.cookie. These DOM objects may be replaced with script that returns the value for that DOM object as if it had been accessed in the context of the requested site's domain. If an attacker constructs a page that obfuscates the document.cookie element in such a way as to avoid being rewritten by the web VPN, then the document.cookie object in the returned page will represent all of the user's cookies for the web VPN domain. Included in this document.cookie are the web VPN session ID cookie itself and any globally unique cookies set by sites requested through the web VPN. The attacker may then use these cookies to hijack the user's VPN session and any other sessions accessed through the web VPN that rely on cookies for session identification.Additionally, an attacker could construct a page with two frames: one hidden and one that displays a legitimate intranet site. The hidden frame could log all keys pressed in the second, benign frame and submit these keypresses as parameters to a XMLHttpRequest GET to the attacker's site, rewritten in web VPN syntax.Note that if the VPN server is allowed to connect to arbitrary Internet sites, these vulnerabilities can be exploited by any site on the Internet. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted web page, a remote attacker may be able to obtain VPN session tokens and read or modify content (including cookies, script, or HTML content) from any site accessed through the clientless SSL VPN. This effectively eliminates same origin policy restrictions in all browsers. For example, the attacker may be able to capture keystrokes while a user is interacting with a web page. Because all content runs at the privilege level of the web VPN domain, mechanisms to provide domain-based content restrictions, such as Internet Explorer security zones and the Firefox add-on NoScript, may be bypassed. For additional information about impacts, please see CERT Advisory [CA-2000-02](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html#impact). |

### Solution

| There is no solution to this problem. Depending on their specific configuration and location in the network these devices may be impossible to operate securely. Administrators are encouraged to view the below workarounds and see the systems affected section of this document for more information about specific vendors. |
| --- |

| **Limit URL rewriting to trusted domains**If supported by the VPN server, URLs should only be rewritten for trusted internal sites. All other sites and domains should not be accessible through the VPN server.Since an attacker only needs to convince a user to visit web page being viewed through the VPN to exploit this vulnerability, this workaround is likely to be less effective if there are a large number of hosts or domains that can be accessed through the VPN server. When deciding which sites can be visited through use of the VPN server, it is important to remember that all allowed sites will operate within the same security context in the web browser.**Limit VPN server network connectivity to trusted domains**It may be possible to configure the VPN device to only access specific network domains. This restriction may also be possible by using firewall rules.**Disable URL hiding features**Obfuscating URLs hides the destination page from the end user. This feature can be used by an attacker to hide the destination page of any links they send. For example, https://<vpn.example.com>/attack-site.com vs https://<vpn.example.com>/778928801. |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| Any clientless, browser-based SSL VPN that proxies multiple domains as a single domain violates the same origin policy and is considered to be vulnerable. Vendors of such products are listed as "affected."Clientless SSL VPN products ship with a variety of default configurations and available security features. Some products by default provide limited or no access and require an administrator to enable specific domains (or all domains). Depending on functional and security requirements, network architecture, and available security features, it may be possible to operate a clientless SSL VPN in a way that minimizes the potential impact of these vulnerabilities. Users are encouraged to review product documentation and features to determine whether a clientless SSL VPN meets security requirements. |

### [Microsoft Corporation](#RGII-7W5GT3) Affected

Notified:  September 24, 2009  Updated: December 07, 2009

**Statement Date:   December 05, 2009**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

If customer chooses co-host resources of a different trust (different web applications and ssl-vpn internal application/portal) this situation can arise.

Although there is another choice that customer can make - use a separate domain for each application. The trade-off is cost vs security - using dedicated domain names, requires wild-card certificates, and multiple dns registrations. We encourage our customers to go with this solution, but as always customers have the right to choose cost of deployment over security.

While we agree with the less secure option this may pose an issue in certain deployments. With the more secure option available we feel that this is not a vulnerability in our products.

### [aep NETWORKS](#MAPG-7XJSA4) Affected

Notified:  November 06, 2009  Updated: December 17, 2009

**Statement Date:   December 17, 2009**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Regarding US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU# 261869, AEP Netilla currently mitigates exposure because of its secure design. By default, AEP Netilla is “locked down” meaning all access to and from Netilla is denied. All types of access must be explicitly granted. Thus, when a Web reverse proxy application is configured on Netilla, users cannot access the application and Netilla will not allow the connection to the application until policies that grant access are created. Details such as whether or not to allow cookies are part of the connection access policy.

Because all access to and from Netilla is denied by default, any attempt to direct a user to an attacker created web page will be denied. Netilla is also protected from the other method described in the Vulnerability Note where user key strokes are trapped in a hidden frame. When that frame attempts to send out the captured data, the data is re-written to go to Netilla where Netilla's policy checking engine will drop the data.

AEP recommends that Netilla customers only add access rules for known trusted sites. If customers require access to servers outside of their control AEP recommends that they only configure policy rules that grant the absolute minimal access needed and can further mitigate the risk with these application policy settings: Cookie Support = No; JavaScript Handling = Delete; Vbscript Handling = Delete; and Host Name Hiding, a system-wide configuration setting, should be left at the default option = Do Not Hide.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

CERT/CC has listed AEP Networks as vulnerable because certain configurations are subject to the issues described in the note. Administrators are encouraged to review their deployment for applicability.

If you have feedback, comments, or additional information about this vulnerability, please send us email.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
