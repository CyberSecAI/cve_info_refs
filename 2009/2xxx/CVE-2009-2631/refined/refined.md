Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-2631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how clientless SSL VPN products handle web content. These VPNs act as proxies, retrieving content from various internal resources and presenting it to the user's browser as if it all originated from the VPN server's domain. This breaks the browser's same-origin policy, which is designed to prevent scripts from one domain from accessing data from another.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Bypassing Same-Origin Policy:** The core weakness is that the VPN's proxy mechanism causes all web content, regardless of its actual origin, to appear to be from the VPN's domain. This means that JavaScript from a malicious internal web page can access cookies, DOM objects, and other resources belonging to other applications and the VPN itself.
2.  **Session Hijacking:** By exploiting the broken same-origin policy, an attacker can gain access to the web VPN's session cookie, which authenticates the user. With this cookie, the attacker can hijack the user's entire VPN session, gaining access to all resources the user has access to.
3.  **Application Cookie Theft:**  Attackers can also steal application cookies (e.g., from an internal webmail system) if those cookies are passed to the browser.
4.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Any XSS vulnerability in *any* internal application accessible through the VPN becomes a significant threat. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into these vulnerable applications.
5.  **Keystroke Logging:** An attacker can use iframes (hidden and visible) to capture keystrokes from a user interacting with a legitimate page. The captured keystrokes can be exfiltrated via XMLHttpRequests.
6.  **URL Obfuscation:** Some VPNs use URL hiding, which makes it easier for an attacker to conceal malicious links.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete VPN Compromise:** An attacker who compromises a VPN session gains full access to the internal network resources the user has access to, including sensitive data.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker can steal confidential information such as emails, internal documents, and application data.
*   **Account Hijacking:** By stealing application-specific cookies, attackers can compromise user accounts within those applications.
*   **Malware Deployment:** Attackers can use compromised VPN sessions to distribute malware to the internal network.
*   **Circumvented Security Zones:** Browser-based security mechanisms such as security zones in Internet Explorer and add-ons like NoScript in Firefox, are ineffective when all content is treated as belonging to the VPN domain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Internal Web Pages:** An attacker could compromise an internal web application, then embed malicious scripts within it that exploit the VPN's broken security model.
*   **Malicious Email Attachments:** An attacker could send an email to a user within the internal network, with a malicious HTML attachment that exploits the vulnerability when viewed through the VPN.
*   **Compromised Internet Sites:**  If the VPN server allows connection to untrusted Internet resources, an attacker can leverage malicious pages on the public internet.
*   **XSS in VPN Itself:** An attacker could exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the SSL VPN's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Inject Malicious Scripts:** An attacker must be able to inject malicious scripts into a webpage that will be viewed via the VPN. This can be achieved via:
    *   Compromising a vulnerable internal web application.
    *   Tricking a user into opening a malicious HTML document (e.g., through email).
*   **Access to the VPN Network:**  An attacker does not need to be directly on the VPN network to exploit this vulnerability if the VPN is configured to connect to untrusted internet resources. A user within the organization, that uses the VPN, must be convinced to visit the malicious page.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable VPN Configuration:**  The attacker needs to understand the VPN's structure to be able to target the vulnerable VPN domain correctly.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is not specific to a single vendor, and affects most clientless SSL VPN products.
*   There is no reliable fix for this design flaw. Workarounds are generally focused on limiting access and segmentation.
*   The provided content mentions various vendors and their responses, with some suggesting the use of non-clientless (e.g. AnyConnect for Cisco) VPNs to mitigate the issue, or by limiting URL rewriting to trusted domains only.
