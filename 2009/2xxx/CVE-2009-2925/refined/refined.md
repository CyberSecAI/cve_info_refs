Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **CVE ID:** CVE-2009-2925
* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DJ Calendar CGI script is vulnerable to a file disclosure vulnerability. Specifically, it doesn't properly sanitize user input in the `TEMPLATE` parameter, allowing directory traversal.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    * **Directory Traversal:** The application allows the user to control the path to a template file. By manipulating the `TEMPLATE` parameter with directory traversal sequences like `/../../`, an attacker can access files outside of the intended directory.
    * **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input before using it to access files.
* **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system that the web server user has permissions to access, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or user data. This vulnerability can lead to information disclosure.
* **Attack vectors:**
    * **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious GET request to the vulnerable CGI script (`DJcalendar.cgi`) with a manipulated `TEMPLATE` parameter.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No prior authentication is needed. The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable script (`DJcalendar.cgi`).

**Technical Details:**

The exploit is demonstrated using the following URL:

```
/cgi-bin/DJcalendar.cgi?TEMPLATE=/../../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

This URL attempts to read the `/etc/passwd` file by using the `TEMPLATE` parameter to traverse out of the web directory.
