How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [Dovecot-news] Security holes in CMU Sieve plugin

A recently found security hole in Cyrus Sieve exists also in Dovecot,
because Dovecot's Sieve plugin is based on libsieve from Cyrus project.
I also found and fixed a few additional buffer overflows that I can't
really understand why I hadn't noticed/fixed before.

This security hole affects all installations that give their users any
kind of ability to modify their Sieve scripts. Even if you give only
limited access it might be enough for an attacker. For example
forwarding a user's mails to about 100 addresses should do the trick.

Since these are buffer overflows for variables in stack, they're very
likely exploitable and allow attackers to execute arbitrary code as the
user.

Note that this security hole doesn't exist in Stephan Bosch's excellent
new Sieve plugin for Dovecot v1.2. I encourage everyone to switch to
using it as soon as possible. Who knows what other holes still lurk in
libsieve.

The bugs are fixed in v1.1.7 release for Dovecot v1.1+:

<http://dovecot.org/releases/sieve/dovecot-sieve-1.1.7.tar.gz>
<http://dovecot.org/releases/sieve/dovecot-sieve-1.1.7.tar.gz.sig>

and in v1.0.4 release for Dovecot v1.0:

<http://dovecot.org/releases/sieve/dovecot-sieve-1.0.4.tar.gz>
<http://dovecot.org/releases/sieve/dovecot-sieve-1.0.4.tar.gz.sig>

You can also get them as a patch:

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                                 Nico Golde
September 7th, 2009                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : cyrus-imapd-2.2
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : none assigned yet

It was discovered that the SIEVE component of cyrus-imapd, a highly scalable
enterprise mail system, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing
SIEVE scripts.  Due to incorrect use of the sizeof() operator an attacker is
able to pass a negative length to snprintf() calls resulting in large positive
values due to integer conversion.  This causes a buffer overflow which can be
used to elevate privileges to the cyrus system user.  An attacker who is able
to install SIEVE scripts executed by the server is therefore able to read and
modify arbitrary email messages on the system.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-10+etch2.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-14+lenny1.

For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem
will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- silc-toolkit
An update of slic-toolkit fixes a stack-based overflow that could be
triggered by encoding an ASN.1 OID (CVE-2008-7159) and several
format string bugs (CVE-2009-3051, CVE-2008-7160).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1

Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- openldap2
openldap did not properly handle embedded NUL characters in X.509
certificates when comparing host names. Attackers could exploit that
to spoof SSL servers (CVE-2009-2408).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- cyrus-imapd
This update of cyrus-imapd fixes a buffer overflow that occurs in snprintf()
due to incorrectly calculating the size of the destination buffer.
(CVE-2009-2632)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
This update of java-1\_6\_0-openjdk fixes the following issues:
- CVE-2009-2670: OpenJDK Untrusted applet System properties access

- CVE-2009-2673: OpenJDK proxy mechanism allows non-authorized socket
connections
- CVE-2009-2674: Java Web Start Buffer JPEG processing integer overflow
- CVE-2009-2675: Java Web Start Buffer unpack200 processing integer overflow
- CVE-2009-2625: OpenJDK XML parsing Denial-Of-Service
- CVE-2009-2475: OpenJDK information leaks in mutable variables
- CVE-2009-2476: OpenJDK OpenType checks can be bypassed
- CVE-2009-2689: OpenJDK JDK13Services grants unnecessary privileges
- CVE-2009-2690: OpenJDK private variable information disclosure
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1
- postgresql
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in PostgrSQL
- CVE-2009-3229: allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial
of service
- CVE-2009-3230: allows remote authenticated users to gain higher
privileges
- CVE-2009-3231: when using LDAP authentication with anonymous
binds, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an
empty password
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- IBMJava2-JRE/java-1\_4\_2-ibm
IBM Java 1.4.2 was updated to SR13 FP1 to fix the following security
issues:
CVE-2009-2625: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with parsing XML data might allow a remote client to create a
denial-of-service condition on the system that the JRE runs on.
CVE-2008-5349: A vulnerability in how the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) handles certain RSA public keys might cause the JRE to consume
an excessive amount of CPU resources. This might lead to a Denial of
Service (DoS) condition on affected systems. Such keys could be
provided by a remote client of an application.
This issue affects the following security providers: IBMJCE,
IBMPKCS11Impl and IBMJCEFIPS.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLES9, SLE11
- wireshark
Specially crafted packets could crash the OPC UA dissector in
Wireshark (CVE-2009-3241)
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- freeradius
This update of freeradius fixes a remote denial-of-service bug in
function rad\_decode() which can be triggered by zero-length
Tunnel-Password attributes to make radiusd crash (CVE-2009-3111).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3, SLE10-SP2, SLES9
- dovecot
An update of dovecot fixes two buffer overflows in the sieve plug-in

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# USN-838-1: Dovecot vulnerabilities

28 September 2009

Dovecot vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [dovecot](/security/cves?package=dovecot) -

## Details

It was discovered that the ACL plugin in Dovecot would incorrectly handle

negative access rights. An attacker could exploit this flaw to access the

Dovecot server, bypassing the intended access restrictions. This only

affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-4577](/security/CVE-2008-4577))

It was discovered that the ManageSieve service in Dovecot incorrectly

handled ".." in script names. A remote attacker could exploit this to read

and modify arbitrary sieve files on the server. This only affected Ubuntu

8.10. ([CVE-2008-5301](/security/CVE-2008-5301))

It was discovered that the Sieve plugin in Dovecot incorrectly handled

certain sieve scripts. An authenticated user could exploit this with a

crafted sieve script to cause a denial of service or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2009-2632](/security/CVE-2009-2632), [CVE-2009-3235](/security/CVE-2009-3235))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.04

* [dovecot-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot)
  -
  [1:1.1.11-0ubuntu4.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot/1%3A1.1.11-0ubuntu4.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [dovecot-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot)
  -
  [1:1.1.4-0ubuntu1.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot/1%3A1.1.4-0ubuntu1.3)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [dovecot-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot)
  -
  [1:1.0.10-1ubuntu5.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dovecot/1%3A1.0.10-1ubuntu5.2)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Looks like few more overflows were spotted and fixed by Dovecot
upstream while fixing this issue in their copy of CMU sieve code:

<http://dovecot.org/list/dovecot-news/2009-September/000135.html>

These seem to deserve separate CVE.
