CVE-2009-2632: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the SIEVE component of Cyrus IMAP, and Dovecot's Sieve plugin due to incorrect calculation of buffer sizes in snprintf() calls. An attacker can pass a negative length to snprintf(), which, due to integer conversion, becomes a very large positive number leading to a buffer overflow.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Incorrect use of `sizeof()` operator leading to negative length being passed to `snprintf()`.
- Integer conversion results in large positive values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in `actions_string` of Sieve script processing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable service (e.g. the cyrus user in Cyrus IMAP or the dovecot user in Dovecot).
- Ability to read and modify arbitrary email messages on the system if exploiting Cyrus IMAP.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted Sieve scripts, either through direct submission or using email forwarding to multiple addresses.
- An attacker needs to have the ability to modify or create SIEVE scripts.
- Remote or local, depending on if users can submit custom sieve scripts or how the service is configured.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be able to install Sieve scripts that are executed by the server.
- For Dovecot, even limited Sieve access (like the ability to forward to multiple addresses) is sufficient.
- For Cyrus IMAP, an attacker needs to be able to install and execute SIEVE scripts.
