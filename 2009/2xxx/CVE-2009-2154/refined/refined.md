Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the `/admin/login.php` file. This is due to unsanitized user input (`$_POST['username']` and `$_POST['password']`) being directly used in a SQL query.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is also vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability is present in the `index.php` file.

**Root Cause:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The root cause is the lack of input sanitization or parameterized queries when handling user-provided data in the SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The root cause is the lack of proper output encoding or sanitization when user-provided data is displayed in the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the login authentication by injecting SQL code into the username field, gaining unauthorized access to the administrative panel.
    *   **Data Exposure/Modification:** Once logged in, the attacker can potentially perform other database actions like read, modify or delete data,
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Arbitrary Javascript Execution:** The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code which is executed when a victim visits a vulnerable page in their browser.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can potentially steal cookies which would allow session hijacking
    *   **Phishing:** The attacker can redirect the user to a malicious page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector is through the login form on the `/admin/login.php` page, specifically by manipulating the `username` field.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attack vector is through the URL parameter `sort` in the `/index.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to submit form data to the `/admin/login.php` page. They do not need to be authenticated. The `magic_quotes_gpc` php setting must be off.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a victim to visit that URL.

**Additional Notes**
* The provided exploit targets `impleo music Collection 2.0`
* The exploit information also lists CVE-2009-2153 which is a separate CVE
