- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper verification of the `CurrentFolder` parameter in several connector modules of FCKeditor. This allows for exposure of arbitrary directories on the server filesystem and uploading files to arbitrary locations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Unsanitized input leading to directory traversal.
    - Arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
    - XSS vulnerabilities in the packaged samples directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Exposure of the contents of arbitrary directories on the server filesystem.
    - Remote file uploads to arbitrary locations, enabling the installation of remote shells and other malicious files.
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks due to vulnerabilities in sample files.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -  By manipulating the `CurrentFolder` parameter in the FCKeditor connector modules.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Remote unauthenticated access to the FCKeditor file upload functionality.
