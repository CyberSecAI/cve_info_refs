Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-2560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a NULL pointer dereference within the RADIUS dissector of Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a NULL pointer dereference. This occurs when the program attempts to access memory through a pointer that doesn't point to a valid memory location (is NULL), leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit of this vulnerability results in a denial of service (DoS) condition, specifically causing Wireshark to crash.
- This can occur remotely or by convincing someone to open a malformed packet trace file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafted network packets or malformed packet capture files that, when processed by Wireshark's RADIUS dissector, trigger the NULL pointer dereference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to send crafted network packets to a system running a vulnerable version of Wireshark, or be able to provide a malformed packet trace file to a user who opens it with Wireshark.

**Affected Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 0.10.13 through 1.0.9, and 1.2.0 are affected by this vulnerability.

**Resolution:**
- The vulnerability is resolved in Wireshark version 1.0.10 and later.
- A workaround is to disable the RADIUS dissector.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was initially grouped together with other dissector flaws under CVE-2009-2560, but was later requested to be split because the RADIUS dissector flaw affected more versions than the others.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Wireshark developers internally.
- Debian security advisory DSA-1942-1 also addresses this vulnerability, among others, in their wireshark packages.
