## Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
the [download
page](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html) on the main web site.

system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages
can be found on the
[download page](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty) on the Wireshark web site.

## File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.

## Known Problems

Wireshark may appear offscreen on multi-monitor Windows systems.
([Bug

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hello Steve, vendors,

  1, thank you for the prompt assignment.

  2, what's related to:

    Name: CVE-2009-2560

    Reference: VUPEN:ADV-2009-1970
    Reference: URL:<http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2009/1970>

    Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Wireshark 1.2.0 allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors
    in the (1) Bluetooth L2CAP, (2) RADIUS, or (3) MIOP dissectors.

    This one will need to be split into two different ones, because:

    a, the Bluetooth L2CAP and MIOP dissectors flaws are affecting only
       version Wireshark 1.2.0 (as mentioned in upstream's
       wnpa-sec-2009-04.html)

    b, but the RADIUS dissector issue affects also prior versions of
       Wireshark -- issue / crash confirmed also in upstreams
       Wireshark-1.0.8.

  Could you please split the CVE-2009-2560 into two CVE ids?
  (one for the L2CAP, MIOP dissectors, other one for
   the RADIUS).

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

P.S.: Affected Wireshark versions in other CVE identifiers
      assigned within this update are sane.

Package        : wireshark
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1268 CVE-2008-1829 CVE-2009-2560 CVE-2009-2562 CVE-2009-3241 CVE-2009-3550 CVE-2009-3829

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark
network traffic analyzer, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-2560

    A NULL pointer dereference was found in the RADIUS dissector.

CVE-2009-3550

    A NULL pointer dereference was found in the DCERP/NT dissector.

CVE-2009-3829

    An integer overflow was discovered in the ERF parser.

This update also includes fixes for three minor issues, which were
scheduled for the next stable point update. (CVE-2008-1829,
CVE-2009-2562, CVE-2009-3241). Also CVE-2009-1268 was fixed for Etch.
Since this security update was issued prior to the release of the
point update, the fixes were included.

For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.4-5.etch.4.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-3+lenny7.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your Wireshark packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
