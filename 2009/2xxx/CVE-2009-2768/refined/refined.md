Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `load_flat_shared_library()` function of the Linux kernel.
- A recent change in the credentials management code (introduced in v2.6.29-rc1) caused the function to use an uninitialized `cred` pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use of uninitialized pointer:** The `cred` pointer is not properly initialized before being used, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **NULL pointer dereference:** Dereferencing the uninitialized (NULL) pointer results in a crash.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crash can cause the system to become unstable or unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Execution of a shared flat binary:** The vulnerability can be triggered by loading and running a specifically crafted or affected shared flat binary.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
- They must have access to a shared flat binary or be able to introduce a vulnerable one.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced with the new credentials code in `kernel/cred.c`.
- The fix was implemented in the upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/3440625d78711bee41a84cf29c3d8c579b522666>
- This information is extracted from an email thread discussing the vulnerability and requesting a CVE.

This vulnerability can lead to a system crash and thus a denial of service.
