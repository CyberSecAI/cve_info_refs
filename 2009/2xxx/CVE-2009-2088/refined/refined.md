Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the vulnerability described by the fix PK77465:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by setting the WebContainer custom property `disablesecuritypreinvokeonfilters`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Disabling the `securitypreinvokeonfilters` property in the WebContainer leads to a security exposure. The specifics of what security checks are bypassed is not detailed. It is clear that pre-invocation security checks on filters are not performed when this property is set, which introduces a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is not fully detailed. By bypassing pre-invocation security checks on filters, an attacker might be able to execute unauthorized actions or gain access to sensitive data. The specific consequences would depend on the filters and their security implementations within the WebSphere Application Server.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through requests that interact with the filters in the WebSphere Application Server. Specifically, by sending requests to the web application that can be intercepted by the filter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker must be able to send requests to the affected web application.
