The provided content relates to CVE-2009-2178.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The phpDatingClub application is vulnerable to SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Unsanitized user input in the `search.php?mode=day&sform[day]` parameter allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Unsanitized user input in the `website.php?page` parameter allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL Injection: An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or even gain control of the server.
- XSS: An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
- SQL Injection: By manipulating the `sform[day]` parameter in the `search.php` script.
- XSS: By manipulating the `page` parameter in the `website.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges are needed on the victim machine.
