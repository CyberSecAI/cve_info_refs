The provided content is related to CVE-2009-2942.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `mysql-ocaml` package, which provides OCaml bindings for MySQL, was missing a function to call `mysql_real_escape_string()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The absence of `mysql_real_escape_string()` means that the library did not properly handle character encoding when escaping strings for MySQL queries. Specifically, the old `escape_string()` function was insufficient when certain multibyte character encodings were used, potentially leading to insufficient escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
This could allow for SQL injection attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by providing specially crafted input strings to applications using the vulnerable `mysql-ocaml` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to control the input that is passed into the vulnerable function in order to perform SQL injection.
