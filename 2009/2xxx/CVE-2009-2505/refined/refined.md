Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-2505:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within the Internet Authentication Service (IAS) when handling Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) authentication requests. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to the incorrect copying of messages received by the server into memory when processing PEAP authentication attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper validation of PEAP authentication requests leads to an error while copying specific memory structures.
- This memory corruption allows for potential code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    - Execute arbitrary code
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted PEAP authentication request sent to an IAS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to an exposed IAS server.
- The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a malformed PEAP authentication request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specifically triggered when the server uses PEAP with MS-CHAP v2 authentication.
- Windows Server 2008 uses Network Policy Server (NPS) which is also affected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability does not affect Server Core installations of Windows Server 2008
- Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2 and as "Important" for other affected systems
