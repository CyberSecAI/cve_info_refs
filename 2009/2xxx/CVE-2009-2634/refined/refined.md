```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper sanitization of the 'mosConfig_absolute_path' parameter in the 'toolbar_ext.php' file within the com_media_library component. This allows an attacker to inject a remote file path.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the 'mosConfig_absolute_path' parameter in the 'toolbar_ext.php' script of the Joomla component.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla server.
