{
  "CVE-2009-2730": {
    "description": "A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.",
    "affected_components": [
      "gnutls",
      "rhev-hypervisor"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of NULL characters in X.509 certificates within GnuTLS.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The vulnerability lies in how GnuTLS processes X.509 certificates, specifically the handling of NULL characters in certain fields."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack is possible where the attacker could use a crafted certificate to impersonate a legitimate entity or intercept communication.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker intercepts communication between a client and a server, presenting a crafted certificate to the client.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and server. Furthermore, they would need a crafted certificate signed by a CA trusted by the client."
