  "CVE-2009-2666": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2009-2666",
      "Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Technical Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Insufficient input validation of X.509 certificates.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "The vulnerability exists in how fetchmail handles X.509 certificates, specifically in the subjectAltName or Common Name fields, by not properly handling null bytes.",
       "A crafted X.509 certificate with a null byte injected into the subjectAltName or Common Name fields can be used for man-in-the-middle attacks."
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can perform undetected man-in-the-middle attacks, impersonating a legitimate server.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "A malicious actor can craft an X.509 certificate with a null byte in the subjectAltName or Common Name fields.",
         "The attack is carried out during the SSL/TLS handshake process when fetchmail attempts to verify the certificate of a remote server."
      ],
       "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to present the malicious certificate to the vulnerable fetchmail client during the SSL/TLS handshake."
    },
    "Affected Software": {
      "Software": "fetchmail",
      "Versions": [
        "<= 6.3.10",
        "6.3.6-1etch2",
        "6.3.9~rc2-4+lenny1",
        "6.3.9~rc2-6"
      ]
    },
    "Fix Information": {
      "Fixes": [
        "fetchmail 6.3.11 or higher",
         "fetchmail 6.3.6-1etch2 (for Debian etch)",
         "fetchmail 6.3.9~rc2-4+lenny1 (for Debian lenny)",
        "fetchmail 6.3.9~rc2-6 (for Debian sid)"
      ],
      "Mitigation": "Users should use strict certificate validation options such as 'sslcertck ssl sslproto ssl3' for SSL-wrapped ports or 'sslcertck sslproto tls1' for STARTTLS-based services."
    }
  }
