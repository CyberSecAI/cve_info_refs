- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Joomla! Component com_school 1.4 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `classid` parameter in the `showclass` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (e.g., stealing usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table)
    - Data modification or deletion
    - Complete compromise of the database
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible through a web request to the `index.php` file with the following parameters:
    - `option=com_school`
    - `func=showclass`
    - `classid` parameter containing malicious SQL code
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can be remote and only needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance. No prior authentication is required.
