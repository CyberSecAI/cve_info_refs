# WordPress 2.8.1

---

WordPress 2.8.1 fixes [many bugs](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&group=resolution&order=priority&milestone=2.8.1&resolution=fixed) and tightens security for plugin administration pages. [Core Security Technologies](http://corelabs.coresecurity.com/index.php?module=FrontEndMod&action=list&type=advisory) notified us that admin pages added by certain plugins could be viewed by unprivileged users, resulting in information being leaked. Not all plugins are vulnerable to this problem, but we advise upgrading to 2.8.1 to be safe.

What else is new since 2.8?  Read through the highlights below, or  [view all changes since 2.8](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/2.8/?action=stop_on_copy&mode=stop_on_copy&rev=11699&stop_rev=11553&limit=500)

* Certain themes were calling get\_categories() in such a way that it would fail in 2.8. 2.8.1 works around this so these themes won’t have to change.
* Dashboard memory usage is reduced.  Some people were running out of memory when loading the dashboard, resulting in an incomplete page.
* The automatic upgrade no longer accidentally deletes files when cleaning up from a failed upgrade.
* A problem where the rich text editor wasn’t being loaded due to compression issues has been worked around.
* Extra security has been put in place to better protect you from plugins that do not do explicit permission checks.
* Translation of role names fixed.
* wp\_page\_menu() defaults to sorting by the user specified menu order rather than the page title.
* Upload error messages are now correctly reported.
* Autosave error experienced by some IE users is fixed.
* Styling glitch in the plugin editor fixed.
* SSH2 filesystem requirements updated.
* Switched back to curl as the default transport.
* Updated the translation library to avoid a problem with mbstring.func\_overload.
* Stricter inline style sanitization.
* Stricter menu security.
* Disabled code highlighting due to browser incompatibilities.
* RTL layout fixes.

application upgrade, which could lead to a denial of service attack.

CVE-2009-2334

It was discovered that wordpress lacks authentication checks in the
plugin configuration, which might leak sensitive information.

CVE-2009-2854

It was discovered that wordpress lacks authentication checks in various
actions, thus allowing remote attackers to produce unauthorised edits or
additions.

CVE-2009-2851

It was discovered that the administrator interface is prone to a
cross-site scripting attack.

CVE-2009-2853

It was discovered that remote attackers can gain privileges via certain
direct requests.

3. *Vulnerability Description*

WordPress is a web application written in PHP that allows the easy
installation of a flexible weblog on any computer connected to the
Internet. WordPress 2.7 reached more than 6 million downloads during
June 2009 [9].

A vulnerability was found in the way that WordPress handles some URL
requests. This results in unprivileged users viewing the content of
plugins configuration pages, and also in some plugins modifying plugin
options and injecting JavaScript code. Arbitrary native code may be run
by a malicious attacker if the blog administrator runs injected
JavasScript code that edits blog PHP code. Many WordPress-powered blogs,
hosted outside 'wordpress.com', allow any person to create unprivileged
users called subscribers. Other sensitive username information
disclosures were found in WordPress.

4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . WordPress 2.8 and previous
   . WordPress MU 2.7.1 and previous, used in WordPress.com

5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . WordPress 2.8.1
   . WordPress MU 2.8.1, used in WordPress.com

6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Mitigation for the Privileges Unchecked vulnerability (suggested by Core
Security): this vulnerability may be mitigated by controlling access to
files inside the 'wp-admin' folder. Access can be prohibited by using
Apache access control mechanism ('.htaccess' file), see guideline for
more information [11].

7. *Credits*

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Fernando
Arnaboldi and JosÃ© Orlicki from Core Security Technologies. Further
research was made by Jose Orlicki from Core Security Technologies.

8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

8.1. *Introduction*

In the last few years several security bugs were found in WordPress
[1][2]. During 2008, the big amount of bugs reported by researchers lead
to exploitation by blog spammers [3]. During 2009, a new round of
attacks has appeared and security researchers are reporting new bugs or
wrongly fixed previously-reported bugs [4][5]. A path traversal in local
files included by 'admin.php' has been fixed [6][7] but, in our case, we
report that administrative privileges are still unchecked when accessing
any PHP file inside a plugin folder.

8.2. *Access Control Roles*

WordPress has a privilege model where any user has an assigned role [8].
Regarding plugins only users characterized by the role Administrator can
activate plugins. Notice that only the blog hosting owner can add new
plugins because these must by copied inside the host filesystem. The
roles Editor, Author or Subscriber (the latter has the least privileges)
cannot activate plugins, edit plugins, update plugins nor delete plugins
installed by an Administrator. Besides that, the configuration of
specific plugins is a grey area because there is no distinguished
capability assigned [8].

Also due to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities inside plugins options
(something very common), non-administrative users reconfiguring plugins
may inject persistent JavaScript code. Possibly arbitrary native code
can be executed by the attacker if the blog administrator runs injected
JavasScript code that injects PHP code. It is important to observe that
many WordPress-powered blogs are configured to allow any blog visitor to
create a Subscriber user without confirmation from the Administrator
role inside the following URL, although by default the Administrator
role must create these new users.

/-----------

http://[some_wordpress_blog]/wp-login.php?action=register
- -----------/

 This can be modified by the administrator in 'Membership/Anyone can
register'.

/-----------

http://[some_wordpress_blog]/wp-admin/options-general.php
- -----------/

8.3. *Privileges Unchecked in admin.php?page= Plugin Local File Includes
(CVE-2009-2334, BID 35581)*

No privileges are checked on WordPress plugins configuration PHP modules
using parameter 'page' when we replace 'options-general.php' with
'admin.php'. The same thing happens when replacing other modules such as
'plugins.php' with 'admin.php'. Basic information disclosure is done
this way. For example, with the following URL a user with no privileges
can see the configuration of plugin Collapsing Archives, if installed.

/-----------

http://[some_wordpress_blog]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=/collapsing-archives/options.txt
- -----------/

 Instead of the following allowed URL.

/-----------

http://[some_wordpress_blog]/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=collapsing-archives/options.txt
- -----------/

 Another example of this information disclosure is shown on Akismet, a
plugin shipped by default with WordPress.

/-----------

http://[some_wordpress_blog]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=akismet/readme.txt
- -----------/

 All plugins we have tested are vulnerable to this kind of information
disclosure, but in many of them the PHP files accessed just crashed. On
the other hand, for example, with capability 'import', privileges are
checked inside 'admin.php':

/-----------

if ( ! current_user_can('import') )
    wp_die(__('You are not allowed to import.'));
- -----------/

 More dangerous scenarios exist, all of them can be exploited by users
with the Subscriber role, the least privileged.

8.4. *Abuse example: XSS in plugin configuration module*

If installed, *Related Ways To Take Action* is an example of a WordPress
plugin that is affected by many cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
(XSS) that can be leveraged by an attacker using the unchecked
privileges described in this advisory to inject persistent JavaScript
code. Possibly, arbitrary native code can be executed by the attacker if
the blog administrator, when he/she logs in, runs injected JavasScript
code that edits blog PHP code. The original URL for reconfiguring the
plugin can be accessed only by the Administrator role.

/-----------

http://[some_wordpress_blog]/wordpress/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=related-ways-to-take-action/options.php
- -----------/

 But replacing the PHP file with the generic 'admin.php' any blog user
can modify this configuration.

/-----------

http://[some_wordpress_blog]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=related-ways-to-take-action/options.php
- -----------/

 The following JavaScript injection can be entered within field *Exclude
actions by term* to exemplify this kind of abuse. When the administrator
enters the same page the injected browser code will be executed and
possibly blog PHP can be modified to run arbitrary native code.

/-----------

\"/><script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88)+String.fromCharCode(83)+String.fromCharCode(83))</script><ahref="

- -----------/

 This is the worst scenario that we found for the vulnerability.

8.5. *Abuse example: viewing WP Security Scanner Plugin Dashboard*

If installed, the WordPress Security Scanner Plugin dashboard can be
viewed similarly by any user besides the administrator using the plugin
configuration page URL without modification. This dashboard includes
common default blog configuration settings that are insecure and should
be modified by the blog administrator or hosting.

/-----------

http://[some_wordpress_blog]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-security-scan/securityscan.php
- -----------/

8.6. *Abuse example: reconfiguring WP-IDS, a WordPress Hardening Project*

If installed, the *Intrusion Detection System Plugin (WPIDS)*[10] can be
reconfigured accessed with the same vulnerability.

/-----------

http://[some_wordpress_blog]/wp-admin/index.php?page=wp-ids/ids-admin.php
- -----------/

 This gives an attacker the possibility to disable many features of the
plugin, for example reactivate the forgotten password feature and
reactivate the XML-RPC blog interface. Also you can deny the weblog
service by configuring this plugin to be overly sensitive, blocking any
request. However the plugin cannot be totally disabled because the
essential IDS parameters 'Maximum impact to ignore bad requests' and
'Minimum impact to sanitize bad requests' are verified on the server
side of the blog and cannot be distorted to deactivate the sanitizing or
blocking features of the web IDS plugin.

8.7. *Other Information Disclosures (CVE-2009-2335, CVE-2009-2336, BID
35584)*

WordPress discriminates bad password from bad user logins, this reduces
the complexity of a brute force attack on WordPress blogs login
(CVE-2009-2335, BID 35584). The same user information disclosure happens
when users use the forgotten mail interface to request a new password
(CVE-2009-2336, same BID 35584). These information disclosures seem to
be previously reported [6] but the WordPress team is refusing to modify
them alleging *user convenience*.

Default installation of WordPress 2.7.1 leaks the name of the user
posting entries inside the HTML of the blog.

/-----------

  <small>June 3rd, 2009 <!-- by leakedusername --></small>
- -----------/

Also several administrative modules give to anyone the complete path
where the web application is hosted inside the server. This may simplify
or enable other malicious attacks. An example follows.

/-----------

http://[some_wordpress_blog]/wp-settings.php
- -----------/

/-----------

Notice: Use of undefined constant ABSPATH - assumed 'ABSPATH' in
[WP_LEAKED_PATH]\wp-settings.php on line 110
Notice: Use of undefined constant ABSPATH - assumed 'ABSPATH' in

Core for testing. WordPress team asserts that password and username
discrimination as well as username leakage are known and will not be
fixed because they are convenient for the users.

. 2009-06-12:
Core tells the WordPress team that the patch will be tested by Core as a
courtesy as soon as possible. It also requests confirmation that
WordPress versions 2.8 and earlier, and WordPress.com, are vulnerable to
the flaws included in the advisory draft CORE-2009-0515.

. 2009-06-12:
WordPress team confirms that WordPress 2.8 and earlier plus
WordPress.com are vulnerable to the flaws included in the advisory draft.

. 2009-06-17:
Core informs the WordPress team that the patch is only fixing one of the
four proof of concept abuses included in the advisory draft. Core
reminds the WordPress team that the advisory is scheduled to be
published on June 22th but a new schedule can be discussed.

. 2009-06-19:
Core asks for a new patched version of WordPress, if available, and
notifies the WordPress team that the publication of the advisory was
re-scheduled to June 30th.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
