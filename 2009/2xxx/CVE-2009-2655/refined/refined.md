{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer handles unicode characters when searching text using the findText function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The mshtml.dll library has a unicode parsing error that leads to a crash due to a potential stack or heap overflow when the findText function is used with specific unicode characters.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, specifically causing Internet Explorer 7/8 to crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote. A specially crafted HTML page, when loaded in a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer, triggers the crash when the javascript code calls the findText function with malicious Unicode.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to get a user to open a malicious web page using Internet Explorer 7 or 8."
