Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-2341

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `albumid` parameter of the `albumdetail.php` script of Opial 1.0. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Database compromise:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or even gain administrative control over the database server. The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement, which can be used to read information from other database tables. In this case, it attempts to extract the database version and current user.
*   **Full compromise of the web application** can also be possible

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request to `albumdetail.php`, where the `albumid` parameter is manipulated to include SQL injection payloads.
*   **Remote Attack:** This is a remote attack and does not require any authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL injection:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how SQL injection works. No other special privileges or capabilities are required.

**Technical details:**
*   The provided exploit example shows a URL where the `albumid` parameter is set to `-31+union/**/select/**/1,version(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,user(),16--`.
*   This payload uses a `UNION SELECT` statement, which allows the attacker to retrieve the database version (`version()`) and current user (`user()`) information.
