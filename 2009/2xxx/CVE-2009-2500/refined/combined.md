# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-062 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in GDI+ Could Allow Remote Code Execution (957488)

Published: October 13, 2009 | Updated: January 12, 2010

**Version:** 2.2

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows GDI+. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted image file using affected software or browsed a Web site that contains specially crafted content. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003; Windows Vista and Windows Vista Service Pack 1; Windows Vista x64 Edition and Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 1; Windows Server 2008 for 32-bit Systems, Windows Server 2008 for x64-based Systems, and Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems; Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 when installed on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, SQL Server 2000 Reporting Services Service Pack 2, all supported editions of SQL Server 2005, Microsoft Report Viewer 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package, Microsoft Report Viewer 2008 Redistributable Package, and Microsoft Report Viewer 2008 Redistributable Package Service Pack 1.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 and Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 on Microsoft Windows 2000; Microsoft Office XP; Microsoft Office 2003; all affected Office Viewer software for Microsoft Office 2003; 2007 Microsoft Office System; all affected Office Viewer software for 2007 Microsoft Office System; Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack; Microsoft Office Project 2002; Microsoft Visio 2002; Microsoft Works 8.5; and Microsoft Forefront Client Security 1.0.

For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by introducing proper data validations within GDI+ when rendering WMF images; modifying the way that GDI+ manages a heap buffer when reading a PNG file; modifying the way that GDI+ allocates a buffer used when reading TIFF files; modifying the way that GDI+ manages buffers when certain .NET API calls are made; modifying the way that GDI+ calculates the required size of a buffer while parsing a PNG image; and modifying the way that Microsoft Office opens specially crafted files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 957488](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/957488) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

**I donât have Microsoft Works 8 on my system, but Microsoft Office installed a Works subdirectory with gdiplus.dll in it. Is my system vulnerable?**

The copy of gdiplus.dll in the Works subdirectory is not used by any vulnerable software and will not need to be updated when Microsoft Works is not installed.

**I have a non-vulnerable version of software installed, why am I being offered this update?**

Some of the non-affected software including Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition Service Pack 3 and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats contain the vulnerable shared Office components, but because they do not access the vulnerable code, they are not affected by this vulnerability. However, since the vulnerable code is present, this update will be offered. Both Expression Web and Groove have been removed from the Affected Software table because although these products are delivered with the affected binary, they are not affected. For the full list of software updated by the 2007 Microsoft Office System release, including affected and non-affected but offered products, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 972581](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/972581).

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of software constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a version of the files with an older build number on the system than in the update package, and thus offers the update.

**The last two Microsoft Security Bulletins for GDI+, MS04-028 and MS08-052, list affected and non-affected software that are not listed in this bulletin. Why?**

The software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which supported versions or editions are affected and which supported versions are not affected. Other versions or editions listed in the [MS04-028](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21086) and [MS08-052](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=125468) are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

**Why are Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft Visual FoxPro, and Microsoft Platform SDK Redistributable: GDI+ listed in the Affected Software table if they are not impacted by the vulnerabilities described by this bulletin?**

Microsoft has not identified any attack vectors for these vulnerabilities specific to the affected software updated for Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft Visual FoxPro, or Microsoft Platform SDK Redistributable: GDI+. This security update is being offered to developers who use Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft Visual FoxPro, or Microsoft Platform SDK Redistributable: GDI+ so that they may issue their own updated version of their applications.

**Is Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 affected by the vulnerabilities listed in this bulletin?**

No. By default, Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 is not affected, and will not be offered the update. However, the following software are vulnerable when installed on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4:

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 6\*
* Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1\*\*
* Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 1\*\*
* Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2\*\*
* RSClientPrint ActiveX Control\*
* Microsoft Forefront Client Security 1.0\*

\*These software are only vulnerable when installed on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.

\*\*These software are vulnerable on all supported operating systems. The security updates for these software are only offered for Windows 2000 Service Pack 4. Customers who apply the security updates for supported editions of Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 will also be protected by the vulnerabilities in these software.

Additionally, the updates for developers using Microsoft Visual FoxPro 8.0 Service Pack 1, Microsoft Visual FoxPro 9.0 Service Pack 2, and Microsoft Platform SDK Redistributable: GDI+ only apply for application developers who develop their software on systems running Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.

**Why is Windows Server 2008 Server Core being offered this update?**

The vulnerabilities addressed by this update do not affect supported editions of Windows Server 2008 if Windows Server 2008 was installed using the Server Core installation option, even though the files affected by these vulnerabilities may be present on the system. However, users with the affected files will still be offered this update because the update files are newer (with higher version numbers) than the files that are currently on your system. For more information on this installation option, see [Server Core](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms723891%28vs.85%29.aspx). Note that the Server Core installation option does not apply to certain editions of Windows Server 2008; see [Compare Server Core Installation Options](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/compare-core-installation.aspx).

**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?**

Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646).

**If I have an installation of SQL Server, how am I affected?**

When SQL Server Reporting Services is installed, the affected installations of SQL Server software may host the RSClientPrint ActiveX control. This ActiveX control distributes a copy of gdiplus.dll containing the affected code. Customers are only impacted when the RSClientPrint ActiveX control is installed on Microsoft Windows 2000 operating systems. If the RSClientPrint ActiveX control is installed on any other operating system, the system version of GDI+ will be used and the corresponding operating system update will protect them.

Customers with affected installations of SQL Server that are installed on Windows 2000 operating systems and have the RSClientPrint ActiveX control should apply the update immediately.

SQL Server Reporting Services is an optional component and must be installed for this security update to apply. SQL Server instances which do not have SQL Server Reporting Services installed are not vulnerable, but will still be offered this update.

**Which editions of Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Service Pack 2 include SQL Server Reporting Services?**

SQL Server Reporting Services is an optional component on the following editions of Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Service Pack 2:

* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Enterprise Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Workgroup Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Evaluation Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Enterprise X64 Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Standard X64 Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Developer x64 Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Evaluation x64 Edition
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition for Itanium-based Systems
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition for Itanium-based Systems
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Evaluation Edition for Itanium-based Systems
* Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition with Advanced Services

**What is the RSClientPrint ActiveX control?**

The Microsoft ActiveX control, RSClientPrint, provides client-side printing for reports viewed in HTML Viewer. It provides a **Print** dialog box so that a user can initiate a print job, preview a report, specify pages to print, and change the margins. During a client-side print operation, the report server renders the report as an Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image and uses the print capabilities of the operating system to create the print job and send it to a printer. For more information on the RSClientPrint ActiveX control, see [Using the RSClientPrint Control in Custom Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms159195%28sql.90%29.aspx).

**I have SQL Server Reporting Services installed and I have Microsoft Windows 2000 clients. What actions should I take?**

First, you should apply the security update to your SQL Server Reporting Services servers. Once that installation is complete, you should have your Microsoft Windows 2000 clients connect to the SQL Server Reporting Services server: this will automatically update the ActiveX control on the Microsoft Windows 2000 systems.

**I have SQL Server Reporting Services installed and I have Windows clients for versions other than Microsoft Windows 2000. What actions should I take?**

You should apply the security update available for the version of Microsoft Windows appropriate to the Windows client systems. Customers who do not have Microsoft Windows 2000 clients do not need to apply the update to their SQL Server Reporting Services servers. Microsoft recommends these customers install the update to the affected installations of SQL Server at the earliest convenience if the potential exists that their SQL Server Reporting Services servers will support Microsoft Windows 2000 clients.

As a defense-in-depth measure, a future Update Rollup for ActiveX Kill Bits will include a kill bit to prevent the RSClientPrint ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer. Customers who apply this future kill bit update and have not updated their affected installations of SQL Server at this time will not be able to initiate print jobs until their SQL Servers are updated with this security update.

**Is there a preferred order for updating my operating systems and installations of SQL Server?**

The vulnerability addressed in this security update affects Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 operating systems with the RSClientPrint ActiveX control, as well as the affected SQL Server software.

For affected installations of SQL Server software that have not applied the security update:

* Customers with affected installations of SQL Server software installed on Microsoft Windows 2000 operating systems with the RSClientPrint ActiveX control installed should apply the security update for maximum security.
* Customers with Microsoft Windows 2000 operating systems with the RSClientPrint ActiveX control installed must manually apply the provided kill bit workaround for the RSClientPrint ActiveX control for maximum security. Customers will not be able to initiate print jobs from these systems until their affected installations of SQL Server are updated with the security update.
* Customers who are running Windows XP onwards and have installed the operating system update do not need to take any further action, as the RSClientPrint ActiveX control will use the operating system version of gdiplus.dll.

For affected installations of SQL Server software that have applied the security update:

* Customers with Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 operating systems with the RSClientPrint ActiveX control installed will be offered the updated ActiveX control when they next attempt to initiate a print job.
* Customers who are running Windows XP onwards and have installed the operating system update do not need to take any further action, as the RSClientPrint ActiveX control will use the operating system version of gdiplus.dll. However, these clients will also be offered the updated ActiveX control when they next attempt to initiate a print job.

**I am a third-party application developer and I use gdiplus.dll in my application. Is my application vulnerable and how do I update it?**

Developers who redistribute gdiplus.dll should ensure that they update the version of gdiplus.dll installed with their application by downloading the update provided in this bulletin. Developers are encouraged to follow recommended best practices for using a shared component. For more information on best practices on shared component use, please see the [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 835322](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/835322) on Isolated Applications.

**I am developing software which contains the redistributable file gdiplus.dll. What do I do?**

You should install the security update included in this security bulletin for your development software. If you have redistributed gdiplus.dll with your application, you should issue an updated version of your application to your customers with the updated version of this file included in the download of this security update for your development software.

**If third-party applications use or install the affected gdiplus.dll component, could I still be vulnerable even after I have installed all required Microsoft security updates?**

No, this security update replaces and re-registers the affected component provided with the operating system. If third party applications follow the recommended best practices for using a shared component as a side-by-side assembly then they are also not affected. Customers are potentially at risk if third party applications do not follow the recommended best practices and instead redistribute an old version of gdiplus.dll with their application. Customers who wish to manually check for the registered affected files can compare applications installed on their systems against those listed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 957488](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/957488). Customers are encouraged to contact their third party solutions developer for additional information.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

After installing this security update, customers can selectively disable GDI+ image parsers for certain file formats. As a defense-in-depth measure, customers can reduce their attack surface by editing the registry to disable the BMP, EMF, GIF, ICO, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and WMF formats. The instructions for disabling the BMP, GIF, ICO, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF formats can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 958911](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/958911). The instructions for disabling the EMF and WMF formats can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 941835](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/941835).

**What is GDI+?**

GDI+ is a graphics device interface that provides two-dimensional vector graphics, imaging, and typography to applications and programmers.

**What is VML?**

Vector Markup Language (VML) is an XML-based exchange, editing, and delivery format for high-quality vector graphics on the Web that meets the needs of both productivity users and graphic design professionals. XML is a simple, flexible, and open text-based language that complements HTML. For more information on the VML, see the [product documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb250524.aspx).

## GDI+ WMF Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2500

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ allocates buffer size when handling WMF image files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted WMF image file or browses to a Web site that contains specially crafted content. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-2500](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2500).

#### Mitigating Factors for GDI+ WMF Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2500

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file.

#### Workarounds for GDI+ WMF Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2500

  **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
* **Read e-mails in plain text**

  To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.

  Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of workaround.** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for GDI+ WMF Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2500

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability results from GDI+ improperly validating and restricting buffer lengths passed to the heap.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending Outlook users a specially crafted e-mail, or by sending a specially-crafted Office Document to the user and by convincing the user to open the file or read the message.

Attackers could also exploit this vulnerability by hosting a malicious image on a network share and then convincing a user to browse to the folder in Windows Explorer.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages, visiting Web sites, or opening files from a network share for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read, where Internet Explorer is used frequently, or where users have network share access, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by introducing proper data validations within GDI+ when rendering WMF images.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### FAQ for GDI+ PNG Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2501

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused by an unchecked buffer in the PNG processing by GDI+.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending Outlook users a specially crafted e-mail, or by sending a specially-crafted Office Document to the user and by convincing the user to open the file or read the message. .

Attackers could also exploit this vulnerability by hosting a malicious image on a network share and then convincing a user to browse to the folder in Windows Explorer.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages, visiting Web sites, or opening files from a network share for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read, where Internet Explorer is used frequently, or where users have network share access, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that GDI+ manages a heap buffer when reading a PNG file.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## GDI+ TIFF Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2502

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ allocates memory. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted TIFF file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-2502](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2502).

#### Mitigating Factors for GDI+ TIFF Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2502

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for GDI+ TIFF Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2502

## GDI+ TIFF Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2503

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ allocates memory. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted TIFF file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-2503](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2503).

#### Mitigating Factors for GDI+ TIFF Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2503

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for GDI+ TIFF Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2503

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Restrict access to gdiplus.dll**

  **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
* **Read e-mails in plain text**

  To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.

  Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of workaround.** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

#### FAQ for GDI+ TIFF Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2503

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused by an unchecked buffer in the TIFF processing by GDI+.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending Outlook users a specially crafted e-mail, or by sending a specially-crafted Office Document to the user and by convincing the user to open the file or read the message.

Attackers could also exploit this vulnerability by hosting a malicious image on a network share and then convincing a user to browse to the folder in Windows Explorer.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages, visiting Web sites, or opening files from a network share for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read, where Internet Explorer is used frequently, or where users have network share access, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that GDI+ allocates a buffer used when reading TIFF files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## GDI+ .NET API Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2504

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in GDI+ that can allow a malicious Microsoft .NET application to gain unmanaged code execution privileges. Microsoft .NET applications that are not malicious are not at risk for being compromised because of this vulnerability.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-2504](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2504).

#### Mitigating Factors for GDI+ .NET API Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2504

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* It is very unlikely that an attacker could realistically influence a non-malicious .NET application to make the API calls to the vulnerable functions in the right way to trigger the vulnerability.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user or ASP.NET account. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment this is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for GDI+ .NET API Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2504

#### FAQ for GDI+ .NET API Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2504

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute code either in the context of the currently logged on user, or in the context of the service account associated with an application pool identity.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is a result of an integer overflow in certain GDI+ APIs that are accessible from .NET Framework applications.

**What is CAS?**

Code Access Security (CAS) is a mechanism that helps limit the access that code has to protected resources and operations. For more information about CAS, see MSDN article, [Introduction to Code Access Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c5tk9z76.aspx).

**What is an XBAP?**

An XAML browser application (XBAP) combines features of both Web applications and rich-client applications. Like Web applications, XBAPs can be published to a Web server and launched from Internet Explorer. Like rich-client applications, XBAPs can take advantage of the capabilities of WPF. For more information about XBAPs, see MSDN article, [Windows Presentation Foundation XAML Browser Applications Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa970060.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

In the Web hosting scenario, an attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could obtain the same permissions as the service account associated with the application pool identity of the application pool that a Microsoft .NET application is running under. Depending on Application Pool Isolation configuration and permissions granted to the service account, an attacker might be able to take control over other application pools on the Web server or be able to take complete control of the affected system. For more information about application pool identities and configuration, see TechNet article, [Configure Application Pool Identity](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc781986%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are three scenarios possible for exploitation of this vulnerability: a Web browsing scenario, a Web hosting scenario, and a Microsoft .NET Framework application scenario. These scenarios are described below:

* **Web browsing scenario**

  An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML Browser Application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  If a web hosting environment allows users to upload custom ASP.NET applications, an attacker user could upload a malicious ASP.NET application that uses this vulnerability to break out of the CAS sandbox used by the hosting company to prevent ASP.NET code from performing harmful actions on the server system.
* **Microsoft .NET Framework application scenario**

  An attacker could place a malicious Microsoft .NET Framework application on a network share and lure users on that network to execute this application.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

There are two types of systems at risk from this vulnerability, described below: systems that are using the Web browsing scenario, and systems that are using the Web hosting scenario.

* **Web browsing scenario**

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and is visiting Web sites using a Web browser capable of instantiating XBAPs. Therefore, any systems where a Web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read e-mail on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
* **Web hosting scenario**

  Web hosting sites that allow users to upload custom ASP.NET applications are at increased risk.

**What does the update do?**

This update modifies the way that GDI+ manages buffers when certain .NET API calls are made.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## GDI+ PNG Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3126

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ allocates memory. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted PNG image file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-3126](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3126).

#### Mitigating Factors for GDI+ PNG Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3126

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file.
* The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment this is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for GDI+ PNG Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3126

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the âMicrosoft baseline Security Analyzerâ heading under the section, Microsoft Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.

This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.

To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

* [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

Supported Security Update Installation Switches

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/quiet** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/extract** | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder. |
| **/extract:<path>** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the âMicrosoft baseline Security Analyzerâ heading under the section, Microsoft Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
