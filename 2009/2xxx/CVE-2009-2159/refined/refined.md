Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2009-2159:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content, specifically from exploit-db.com, lists CVE-2009-2159 as one of the multiple CVEs associated with vulnerabilities found in TorrentTrader Classic 1.09. The advisory from waraxe.us also confirms this by mentioning `[waraxe-2009-SA#074] - Multiple Vulnerabilities in TorrentTrader Classic 1.09` and linking to the exploit-db entry. Therefore, the content is relevant to CVE-2009-2159.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

The content identifies a total of 22 vulnerabilities in TorrentTrader Classic 1.09. CVE-2009-2159 specifically relates to **SQL Injection vulnerability in `browse.php`**.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of an uninitialized variable, `wherecatin`, in a SQL query within the `browse.php` script.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The lack of proper sanitization of the `wherecatin` variable before incorporating it into a SQL query allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use blind SQL injection techniques to extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., database version).
    *   **Potential Data Manipulation:** While not explicitly stated, the SQL injection vulnerability could potentially be leveraged to modify data within the database, if the attacker gains sufficient privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `wherecatin` parameter in the HTTP GET request to the `browse.php` script.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **No Authentication Required:** This specific SQL injection vulnerability in `browse.php` does not require any form of authentication, making it accessible to any external user.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit-db content provides detailed examples of how to exploit this vulnerability. It demonstrates how an attacker can:

*   Use a boolean-based blind SQL injection to retrieve information bit by bit by crafting specific `wherecatin` values.
*   Leverage induced SQL errors when no active torrents are present to obtain information.

**Example Payloads (from exploit-db):**

*   **Boolean-Based Blind SQLi (with active torrents):**
    ```
    http://localhost/torrenttrader109/browse.php?wherecatin=0)+OR+IF(LENGTH(@@version)>1,1,2)=(SELECT+1
    ```
*   **Boolean-Based Blind SQLi (with active torrents) (check if version > 50):**
    ```
    http://localhost/torrenttrader109/browse.php?wherecatin=0)+OR+IF(LENGTH(@@version)>50,1,2)=(SELECT+1
    ```
*   **SQL Error based (when no torrents are present):**
    ```
     http://localhost/torrenttrader109/browse.php?wherecatin=0)+OR+IF(LENGTH(@@version)>1,(SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 1),2)=(SELECT+1
    ```

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db content provides a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities discovered in TorrentTrader Classic 1.09 including other SQL injection, XSS, information leakage and LFI issues.
*   The waraxe.us advisory confirms the findings of the exploit-db entry, and provides the link to the exploit.
*   The secunia.com content does not provide vulnerability details.
