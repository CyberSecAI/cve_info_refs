The crash happens when the XPCOM garbage collector collects the query processor for the first file's results. When the results are then repainted, we get into a mess.\nThe fix I found to work (for this case anyway) is to kill the (current) query processor at nsXULTemplateBuilder::LoadDataSources, although I don't know what implications that will have.",
