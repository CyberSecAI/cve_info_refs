- **Root cause of vulnerability**:
  - A malformed SMS message containing a badly formatted WAP Push message triggers a Java `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` in the `android.com.phone` application.
  - A malicious application crafted to call a vulnerable function in the Dalvik API can restart the system process.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Improper handling of malformed WAP Push messages in SMS processing leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
  - Vulnerable API function in the Dalvik API can be exploited by malicious applications or unintentional code paths.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - **Malformed SMS DoS**: Disconnects the mobile phone from the cellular network, leading to temporary loss of connectivity and dropped calls. If a PIN protects the SIM, the user must re-enter the PIN, prolonging the connectivity loss. Repeated triggering of the bug results in a remote denial-of-service condition.
  - **Dalvik API DoS**:  Causes the system process to restart, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

- **Attack vectors**:
  - **Malformed SMS DoS**: Sending a specially crafted malformed SMS message with a badly formatted WAP Push message.
  - **Dalvik API DoS**:  Crafting a malicious application that calls the vulnerable Dalvik API function, or unintentionally placing the vulnerable function in code path that will be executed.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - **Malformed SMS DoS**: Ability to send SMS messages to the target device.
  - **Dalvik API DoS**: Ability to have the user download and execute the malicious application.
