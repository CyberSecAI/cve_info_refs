{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure cookie handling.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application does not properly secure cookies used for authentication, allowing an attacker to forge cookies with administrator privileges.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain administrative access to the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker manipulates the browser's cookies using JavaScript to inject administrator credentials.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser (e.g., through a malicious website or by using the browser's developer tools). The attacker also needs to know the cookie names used for authentication."
