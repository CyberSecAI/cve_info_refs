Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2122:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The exploit-db.com content explicitly mentions "CVE: 2009-2122" and links to the NVD page for this CVE.
   - The description on exploit-db mentions a SQL injection vulnerability in "WordPress Plugin Photoracer 1.0".

   Therefore, the content is relevant to CVE-2009-2122.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**
   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `viewimg.php` file of the Photoracer plugin for WordPress.
   - **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The `id` parameter in the `viewimg.php` script is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to data breaches (reading, modifying, or deleting database records), account compromise, and potentially complete control over the web application.
   - **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is accessible through an HTTP GET request to `viewimg.php` by manipulating the `id` parameter.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site. No special privileges are needed.

**3. Technical Details:**
   - The exploit example provided is: `http://site.pl/wp-content/plugins/photoracer/viewimg.php?id=-1+union+select+0,1,2,3,4,user(),6,7,8--`
   - This demonstrates the use of a UNION-based SQL injection to extract database information, specifically using the `user()` function to determine the current database user.

**Additional Notes**

*   The exploit-db entry provides more specific details than a typical CVE description, including the affected plugin, the vulnerable file, and a sample exploit URL.
*   The secunia.com content is primarily marketing material for their vulnerability intelligence services and does not provide any information about specific CVEs, including CVE-2009-2122, therefore it is not relevant to this analysis.
