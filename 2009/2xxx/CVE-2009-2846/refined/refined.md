Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2846:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing lower bound check in the HPPA ISA EEPROM driver within the Linux kernel. The `loff_t` type, which is a signed type, is used for the position (`ppos`) parameter. If a negative value is passed for `ppos` from userspace, the subsequent range check is bypassed or weakened.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The driver fails to properly validate the `ppos` parameter, specifically not checking for negative values.
- **Memory Corruption:** Due to the negative `ppos`, the `readb()` function will access arbitrary memory locations, leading to potential memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The arbitrary memory access can cause the system to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  The Ubuntu security notice mentions that a local user could make a specially crafted request to gain root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** A local user can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request with a negative `ppos` value to the driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **PA-RISC Kernel with CONFIG_EISA:** The system must be running a PA-RISC kernel with the `CONFIG_EISA` option enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel's HPPA ISA EEPROM driver.
- The vulnerability was fixed by commit `6b4dbcd86a9d464057fcc7abe4d0574093071fcc`
- The issue was initially reported by Eugene Teo.
- The Ubuntu security notice confirms that a local user could exploit this to gain root privileges or crash the system.
