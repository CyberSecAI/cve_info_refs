Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in the `com_k2` component of Joomla.
*   The vulnerability exists within the `category` parameter, which is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation for the `category` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the database, potentially including usernames and passwords. This is demonstrated by the provided SQL injection payload which attempts to extract user credentials.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** In some scenarios, SQL injection can lead to more severe attacks such as remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to a vulnerable Joomla instance. The vulnerable `category` parameter is passed within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Joomla website.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious queries.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable component is `com_k2` (specifically version 1.0.1b) of Joomla.
*   The specific vulnerable parameter is `category` in the URL request.
*   The exploit uses `union` based injection
*   The `jos_users` table is targeted in the example exploit to dump user credentials.
*   The component version 1.0.1 Beta is mentioned in the component's module xml description

**Example URL:**
`http://localHost/path//index.php?option=com_k2&view=itemlist&category=<sql Code>`

**Example SQL injection:**
`null'+and+1=2+union+select+1,concat(username,0x3a,password)ChipD3Bi0s,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14+from+jos_users/*`
