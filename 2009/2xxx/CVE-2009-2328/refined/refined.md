{
  "CVE-2009-2328": {
    "Root cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in multiple files.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL injection in /index.php via cookies",
      "SQL injection in /message.php via the topic parameter",
       "Cross-site scripting (XSS) in /message.php via the topic parameter",
       "Cross-site scripting (XSS) in /add_voting.php via POST parameters",
       "Users deletion via SQL injection in /admin/edit_user.php",
      "Path Disclosure via multiple include files"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying data, bypassing authentication, and deleting users. Additionally, they can inject malicious JavaScript code (XSS) into the application, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions. Path Disclosure can reveal sensitive information about the server's file structure.",
    "Attack vectors": [
     "HTTP Cookies (user_enter, enter_login, enter_parol)",
      "HTTP GET parameter (topic)",
      "HTTP POST parameters (add_voting, v_vopros, v_variant1, v_variant2, del_user_id)",
      "Direct access to multiple include files for Path Disclosure"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. For SQL injection via cookies the attacker needs to be able to set arbitrary cookies. The attacker needs to be able to send GET requests with crafted parameters, and POST requests to exploit all vulnerabilities. No authentication is required to exploit some of the vulnerabilities. However, some require authentication such as user deletion."
