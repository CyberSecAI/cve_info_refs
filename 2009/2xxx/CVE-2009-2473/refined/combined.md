# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=580855#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2010-04-09 09:30:21 UTC  ``` Description of problem: In RHEL 5.5 fully updated, When you have a folder name with spaces, any files inside it cannot be deleted.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): RHEL 5.5 32 bit fully updated. nautilus-2.16.2-7.el5  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a folder called "my folder" for what ever name, but has to have spaces in between the words 2. Create a file inside that 3. Delete that file. It cannot be deleted    Actual results: File cannot be deleted  Expected results: You should be able to delete this  Additional info: This works in RHEL 5.4 and appears to be a regression in 5.5  Attached: Screenshot.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=580855#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2010-04-09 09:34:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 405496](attachment.cgi?id=405496 "screenshot") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=405496&action=edit "screenshot") screenshot   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=580855#c3)  Tomáš Bžatek    2010-04-15 16:02:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 406847](attachment.cgi?id=406847&action=diff "gnome-vfs-2.16.2-same-fs.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=406847&action=edit "gnome-vfs-2.16.2-same-fs.patch") gnome-vfs-2.16.2-same-fs.patch  This is the modified version of patch included in 5.5 release. Turns out that gnome-vfs returns escaped paths when extracted from the URI. This sounds weird and unexpectable, certainly not documented. Since we do g_stat() later then, we need an unescaped path as stored on the disk.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=580855#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2010-04-16 06:55:16 UTC  ``` Hi Tomas,  Any test rpms you could provide, which we can test?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=580855#c7)  Tomáš Bžatek    2010-04-19 08:59:59 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 579502](show_bug.cgi?id=579502 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Error while deleting files") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=580855#c13)  manuel wolfshant    2010-05-19 11:43:55 UTC  ``` I have just verified, the patch fixes the problem.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=580855#c14)  Phil Schaffner    2010-05-20 12:53:36 UTC  ``` See also CentOS [bug #4322](show_bug.cgi?id=4322 "CLOSED WORKSFORME - linuxconf comes up blank w. ShinyMetal theme") <http://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=4322>   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=580855#c23)  Tomáš Bžatek    2012-07-19 12:36:06 UTC  ```      Technical note added. If any revisions are required, please edit the "Technical Notes" field     accordingly. All revisions will be proofread by the Engineering Content Services team.          New Contents: Technical information could be found in the description of previously released RHBA-2010:0436-1 erratum.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=580855#c26)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-08 05:14:35 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0131.html>   ``` |  |

## Topic

Updated gnome-vfs2 packages that fix one security issue and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The gnome-vfs2 packages provide the GNOME Virtual File System, which is the
foundation of the Nautilus file manager. neon is an HTTP and WebDAV client
library embedded in the gnome-vfs2 packages.

A denial of service flaw was found in the neon Extensible Markup Language
(XML) parser. Visiting a malicious DAV server with an application using
gnome-vfs2 (such as Nautilus) could possibly cause the application to
consume an excessive amount of CPU and memory. (CVE-2009-2473)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* When extracted from the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), gnome-vfs2

returned escaped file paths. If a path, as stored in the URI,
contained non-ASCII characters or ASCII characters which are parsed as
something other than a file path (for example, spaces), the escaped path
was inaccurate. Consequently, files with the described type of URI could
not be processed. With this update, gnome-vfs2 properly unescapes paths
that are required for a system call. As a result, these paths are parsed
properly. (BZ#580855)

* In certain cases, the trash info file was populated by foreign

entries, pointing to live data. Emptying the trash caused an accidental
deletion of valuable data. With this update, a workaround has been applied
in order to prevent the deletion. As a result, the accidental data loss is
prevented, however further information is still gathered to fully fix this
problem. (BZ#586015)

* Due to a wrong test checking for a destination file system, the Nautilus

file manager failed to delete a symbolic link to a folder which was
residing in another file system. With this update, a special test has been
added. As a result, a symbolic link pointing to another file system can be
trashed or deleted properly. (BZ#621394)

* Prior to this update, when directories without a read permission were

marked for copy, the Nautilus file manager skipped these unreadable
directories without notification. With this update, Nautilus displays an
error message and properly informs the user about the aforementioned
problem. (BZ#772307)

* Previously, gnome-vfs2 used the stat() function calls for every file on

the MultiVersion File System (MVFS), used for example by IBM Rational
ClearCase. This behavior significantly slowed down file operations. With
this update, the unnecessary stat() operations have been limited. As a
result, gnome-vfs2 user interfaces, such as Nautilus, are more responsive.
(BZ#822817)

All gnome-vfs2 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- cyrus-imapd
This update fixes another buffer overflow in the Sieve code. This can
be exploited by users allowed to use their own sieve scripts to execute
arbitrary code remotely.
CVE-2009-3235: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.5 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
Additionally the handling of long headers was improved.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11

Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- freeradius
This update of freeradius fixes a remote denial-of-service bug in function
rad\_decode() which can be triggered by zero-length Tunnel-Password attri-
butes to make radiusd crash.
CVE-2009-3111: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: SLE10 SP3
- strongswan
The previous fix for a flaw in the ASN.1 parser was incomplete and
had to be reworked.
This could lead to crashes of the pluto IKE daemon.
CVE-2009-2661: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: SLE10 SP3
- openldap2
This update of openldap2 makes SSL certificate verification more robust
against uses of the special character \0 in the subjects name.
CVE-2009-2408: CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.5 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
Affected products: SLE10 SP3
- apache2-mod\_jk
Certain HTTP request could confuse the JK connector in Apache Tomcat which
could result in a user seeing responses destined for other users.
CVE-2008-5519: CVSS v2 Base Score: 2.6 (LOW) (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- expat
Specially crafted XML documents could make expat run into an enless loop,i
therefore locking up applications using expat.
CVE-2009-3720: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could cause buffer overflows in xpdf
when viewing such a document.
CVE-2009-3603: CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.3 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3604: CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.3 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3605: CVSS v2 Base Score: 10.0 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

CVE-2009-3608: CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.3 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
CVE-2009-3609: CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- mozilla-nspr
This update fixes a bug in the Mozilla NSPR helper libraries, which could
be used by remote attackers to potentially execute code via javascript
vectors.
MFSA 2009-59:
Security researcher Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based
buffer overflow in Mozilla's string to floating point number conversion
routines. Using this vulnerability an attacker could craft some malicious
JavaScript code containing a very long string to be converted to a floating
point number which would result in improper memory allocation and the execution
of an arbitrary memory location. This vulnerability could thus be leveraged by
the attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
CVE-2009-1563: CVSS v2 Base Score: 10.0 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0-11.1, SLE10, SLE11

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
