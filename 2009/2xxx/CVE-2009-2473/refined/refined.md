Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-2473:

*   **Vulnerability:** XML entity expansion recursion leading to denial of service.

*   **Root Cause:** The neon library (before version 0.28.6) does not properly detect recursion during XML entity expansion. This weakness is present when neon is linked against expat.

*   **Attack Vector:** A context-dependent attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted XML document containing many nested entity references to an application using the neon library. This is also known as a "billion laughs attack".

*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to excessive memory and CPU consumption on the target system.

*   **Affected Software:** neon library versions prior to 0.28.6, specifically when linked against expat.

*   **Example:** An XML document with nested entities that repeatedly refer to each other, causing exponential expansion when parsed.
