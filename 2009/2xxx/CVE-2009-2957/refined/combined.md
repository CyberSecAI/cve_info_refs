RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes security issues and several
bugs is now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
(RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the IPv6 Extension Header (EH) handling
implementation in the Linux kernel. The skb->dst data structure was not
properly validated in the ipv6\_hop\_jumbo() function. This could possibly
lead to a remote denial of service. (CVE-2007-4567)

The Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team reported two flaws in the routing
implementation. If an attacker was able to cause a large enough number of
collisions in the routing hash table (via specially-crafted packets) for
the emergency route flush to trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if
the kernel routing cache was disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be
left behind after a route lookup, leading to a kernel panic.
(CVE-2009-4272)

A flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in
the Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using packets larger
than the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in
partial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws
could also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.
(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538)

A flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel.
Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network cards
supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of
service. (CVE-2009-4537)

The x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current
Privilege Level (CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL). A user in a guest
could leverage these flaws to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or
possibly escalate their privileges within that guest. (CVE-2010-0298,
CVE-2010-0306)

A flaw was found in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation. Access
to the internal data structure pit\_state, which represents the data state
of the emulated PIT, was not properly validated in the pit\_ioport\_read()
function. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2010-0309)

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2006-6304, CVE-2009-2910,
CVE-2009-3080, CVE-2009-3556, CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, CVE-2009-4020,
CVE-2009-4021, CVE-2009-4138, and CVE-2009-4141; ntp issue CVE-2009-3563;
dbus issue CVE-2009-1189; dnsmasq issues CVE-2009-2957 and CVE-2009-2958;
gnutls issue CVE-2009-2730; krb5 issue CVE-2009-4212; bind issue
CVE-2010-0097; gzip issue CVE-2010-0001; openssl issues CVE-2009-2409 and
CVE-2009-4355; and gcc issue CVE-2009-3736.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* on systems with a large number of disk devices, USB storage devices may

get enumerated after "/dev/sdz", for example, "/dev/sdcd". This was not
handled by the udev rules, resulting in a missing "/dev/live" symbolic
link, causing installations from USB media to fail. With this update, udev
rules correctly handle USB storage devices on systems with a large number
of disk devices, which resolves this issue. (BZ#555083)

As RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from the KVM update
RHSA-2010:0088 have been included in this update:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0088.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=519020#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-08-24 16:09:49 UTC  ``` Core Security Technologies discovered a heap overflow vulnerability in dnsmasq when the TFTP service is enabled ('--enable-tftp').  If the configured tftp-prefix is sufficiently long, and a remote user sent a request which sends a long file name, dnsmasq could crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with root privileges.  The default tftp-prefix is /var/tftpd, which is short enough to make this difficult to exploit; if a longer prefix is used then arbitrary code execution may be possible.  As well, Red Hat does not have TFTP support enabled by default.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=519020#c7)  Vincent Danen    2009-08-24 22:26:44 UTC  ``` CORE has provided two CVE names:  [CVE-2009-2957](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-2957) for the heap overflow issue they found (possibly arbitrary code execution).  [CVE-2009-2958](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-2958) for the NULL-pointer dereference Steve found (remote DoS).  The disclosure date is August 31st.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=519020#c9)  Vincent Danen    2009-08-25 14:22:49 UTC  ``` This is not a critical issue.  dnsmasq starts up as root but by default drops privileges to run as user nobody.  Because it runs non-privileged, and because of the non-default configuration requirements (i.e. enabling TFTP requires running dnsmasq without the initscript or modifying the initscript to enable it), as well as the fact that dnsmasq should realistically only ever be available to the local area network and not the internet-at-large, makes this an important impact issue.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=519020#c10)  Vincent Danen    2009-08-31 20:53:37 UTC  ``` Embargo is lifted; 2.50 is available:  <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=519020#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-09-01 00:18:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1238 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1238.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=519020#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2009-09-02 07:42:58 UTC  ``` Core Security advisory:   <http://www.coresecurity.com/content/dnsmasq-vulnerabilities>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=519020#c14)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-14 01:33:47 UTC  ``` dnsmasq-2.46-3.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=519020#c15)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-14 01:58:52 UTC  ``` dnsmasq-2.46-2.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

# USN-827-1: Dnsmasq vulnerabilities

1 September 2009

Dnsmasq vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [dnsmasq](/security/cves?package=dnsmasq) -

## Details

IvAin Arce, Pablo HernAin Jorge, Alejandro Pablo Rodriguez, MartA­n Coco,

Alberto SoliAto Testa and Pablo Annetta discovered that Dnsmasq did not

properly validate its input when processing TFTP requests for files with

long names. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute

arbitrary code with user privileges. Dnsmasq runs as the 'dnsmasq' user by

default on Ubuntu. ([CVE-2009-2957](/security/CVE-2009-2957))

Steve Grubb discovered that Dnsmasq could be made to dereference a NULL

pointer when processing certain TFTP requests. A remote attacker could

cause a denial of service by sending a crafted TFTP request.

([CVE-2009-2958](/security/CVE-2009-2958))

  -
  [2.47-3ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq/2.47-3ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [dnsmasq-base](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq)
  -
  [2.45-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq/2.45-1ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [dnsmasq-base](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq)
  -
  [2.41-2ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/dnsmasq/2.41-2ubuntu2.2)
