{
  "CVE-2009-2957": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap overflow vulnerability exists in dnsmasq when the TFTP service is enabled, specifically when processing TFTP requests for files with long names. If the configured tftp-prefix is sufficiently long, and a remote user sends a request with a long file name, dnsmasq could crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Heap overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges (although dnsmasq usually runs as a non-privileged user).",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker sends a TFTP request with a long file name to a dnsmasq server with the TFTP service enabled and a long tftp-prefix configured.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send TFTP requests to the target dnsmasq server."
