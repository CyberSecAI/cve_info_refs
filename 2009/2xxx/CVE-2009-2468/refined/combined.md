To learn about other Security Updates, see "[Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222)."

#### Safari 4.0.3

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2468

  Available for: Windows XP and Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in the drawing of long text strings. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. Credit to Will Drewry of Google Inc for reporting this issue.

* **ImageIO**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2188

  Available for: Windows XP and Vista

  Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A buffer overflow exists in the handling of EXIF metadata. Viewing a maliciously crafted image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2196

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Windows XP and Vista

  Impact: A maliciously crafted website may be promoted into Safari's Top Sites view

  Description: Safari 4 introduced the Top Sites feature to provide an at-a-glance view of a user's favorite websites. It is possible for a malicious website to promote arbitrary sites into the Top Sites view through automated actions. This could be used to facilitate a phishing attack. This issue is addressed by preventing automated website visits from affecting the Top Sites list. Only websites that the user visits manually can be included in the Top Sites list. As a note, Safari enables fraudulent site detection by default. Since the introduction of the Top Sites feature, fraudulent sites are not displayed in the Top Sites view. Credit to Inferno of SecureThoughts.com for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2195

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Windows XP and Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A buffer overflow exists in WebKit's parsing of floating point numbers. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. Credit: Apple.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2200

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Windows XP and Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website and clicking "Go" when viewing a malicious plug-in dialog may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information

  Description: WebKit allows the pluginspage attribute of the 'embed' element to reference file URLs. Clicking "Go" in the dialog that appears when an unknown plug-in type is referenced will redirect to the URL listed in the pluginspage attribute. This may allow a remote attacker to launch file URLs in Safari, and lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by restricting the pluginspage URL scheme to http or https. Credit to Alexios Fakos of n.runs AG for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2199

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Windows XP and Vista

  Impact: Look-alike characters in a URL could be used to masquerade a website

  Description: The International Domain Name (IDN) support and Unicode fonts embedded in Safari could be used to create a URL which contains look-alike characters. These could be used in a malicious website to direct the user to a spoofed site that visually appears to be a legitimate domain. This update addresses the issue by supplementing WebKit's list of known look-alike characters. Look-alike characters are rendered in Punycode in the address bar.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011912 Firefox/3.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011912 Firefox/3.0.6
Both Firefox and Camino are exposed to a font rendering integer overflow which exists independently in libpango and in Apple's CoreGraphics (ripc).
I have reported the bug upstream to Apple, but they have no timeline to fix. (Yes, this affects Safari too..)
The issue is in URL bar rendering. If a very long document.location is set via javascript, the integer overflow is reachable. The files at the above location show this bug for each.
The affected code in pango is in pango\_glyph\_string\_set\_size:
An overflow check when doubling the size neglects the overflow possible on the subsequent allocation:
string->glyphs = g\_realloc (string->glyphs, string->space \* sizeof (PangoGlyphInfo));
I don't have a live exploit, but this looks exploitable. I have not yet gotten this reported upstream to libpango. It is pending on their mailing list and I've received no response.
Because of their delay and Apple's delay, I thought it would make the most sense to put a maximum limit on the document.location.
This will be referenced with advisory oCERT-2009-001.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto a pango crasher in <http://static.dataspill.org/glyph/>
E.g., <http://static.dataspill.org/glyph/pango_2.html>
2. Crash.
Depending on how the overflow is handled, you can get it to proceed without a crash.
(Note, I've been tinkering with the crashers so there's nothing special about the different versions, just a few tweaks.)
Actual Results:
In camino, it is often a NULL deref. I can get a few other random stack-addresses visible, but I haven't done a thorough analysis on the Apple libraries to know.
In ff, pango exposes the num\_glyphs after a successful underallocation. If this is used for writing to the glyph array, it will result in heap corruption.
Expected Results:
Maximum URL length and/or integer overflow checks in libpango/ripc would stop this.
Please let me know if I can help coordinate anything. I can be reached at my personal address: redpig@dataspill.org or at my oCERT addr: redpig@ocert.org.
I will be pursuing getting this upstream to pango, but if you have any contacts that can help, that'd be great.
In addition, if you have some idea for Camino fixes, if you plan to release the crashers, please let me know in advance. I would like to negotiate some embargo date with Apple if possible, but who knows.

Crashed for me after an allocation failure (std::bad\_alloc exception) while building a gfxTextRun, presumably out-of-memory.
Another test crashed with memory allocation failure in nsAString\_internal while trying to modify a string with length over 100,000,000 characters(!).
This suggests that allowing a script to create such huge strings is a more general problem, not just an issue for drawing the URL. The exact point where the out-of-memory crash will occur may be difficult to predict, but it's clear that we don't always handle allocation failure well.
When I tried this in Safari just now, it actually crashed in WebCore::KURL::parse, rather than in the font code (although I can easily believe that is also possible).
I tried this on Windows as well (Minefield trunk build); it appeared to hang for some time, and presented an "unresponsive script" message, but allowing it to continue did eventually succeed. It hit several assertions along the way, though:
###!!! ASSERTION: CopyItemSplitOversize() failed: 'NS\_SUCCEEDED(nrs)', file

The WebCore bug when I hit it was a NULL deref. The allocation appears to fail and they don't fail gracefully. I guess I should file a webkit bug too - not sure if Apple propagated my report.

Should this bug be split into an Apple branch and a Pango branch? Or should we keep it together and fix the assertions noted in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=480134#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap/integer overflows during font glyph rendering reachable in FF and Camino (libpango, CoreGraphics)") (mMaxGlyphs < 65535) to avoid triggering either problem. 64K glyphs in one run ought to be enough for anyone.

I'd say let's just keep them together into this bug, and just clamp down on the number of glyphs -- probably much less than 64k, 16k should be fine for one run. roc, does that sound ok? I don't really see us doing a 16k-glyph run in any real world usage..

We certainly can have more than 16k glyphs in real-world usage. A single very large paragraph of white-space:normal text will do it.

[Bug 357637 comment 59](/show_bug.cgi?id=357637#c59 "RESOLVED FIXED - Loading time (Tp) of pages with Chinese text is unbearable") also mentions the integer overflow in Pango, which may be
the same issue as [bug 430127](/show_bug.cgi?id=430127 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crashes due to OOM and appending to form value").

I think we should safely handle textrun creation failures due to OOM. This shouldn't be too hard.
We should also cap the maximum length of strings we pass to platform font engines. We already have code that caps strings passed to ATSUI at 500 characters (or less, when necessary, to work around 32K coordinate limits); see gfxAtsuiFontGroup::GuessMaximumStringLength. It doesn't fail, it just breaks up the incoming strings for separate processing and then glues the resulting textruns back together. The incoming text is broken up quite intelligently, generally at space boundaries so we're unlikely to disturb shapers. We should generalize that to all platforms and limit the text to something sensible (say 1K chars) no matter what.

One thing to keep in mind is that a malicious downloaded font might be able to associate a very large number of glyphs with a single character. Someone who knows a lot about Opentype and AAT might be able to figure out how large that number is.
So we should probably cap the passed-down string length, say to <1K, but also check the number of glyphs returned and bail if it's too large, say >32K.

The problem here, with Pango, is that we can't check the number of glyphs until after pango\_shape has returned, at which point even the number of glyphs may have been overwritten by untrusted data.
It seems that this needs to be fixed in the library.
If we can't rely on the library being fixed, pango\_glyph\_string\_set\_size is a dynamic symbol, so Mozilla can provide its own implementation. PangoGlyphString::space is meant to be private, but I haven't come up with any better ideas.

Attached patch

[patch for safe abort in pango\_glyph\_string\_set\_size](attachment.cgi?id=364394&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=364394&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=480134&attachment=364394)

Callers don't check the new value of num\_glyphs, so I think the best thing to
do is to abort if allocation will not be possible. This is consistent with
what g\_realloc will do on failure anyway.
I'm doubting this particular overflow is likely to be exploitable with current
Pango code (but the patch would make things correct).
This overflow would only happen on 32-bit systems, so I'll consider 32-bit
systems here.
Will, have you seen a SIGSEGV with Pango?
On 32-bit or 64-bit systems?
sizeof(PangoGlyphInfo) is 0x14, so the smallest new\_len passed to
pango\_glyph\_string\_set\_size that will cause an overflow is 0x08000001.
However, the only callers to pango\_glyph\_string\_set\_size that subsequently
write to the PangoGlyphString and don't increase the new\_len gradually are
pango\_ot\_buffer\_output and \_pango\_shape\_shape.
For callers that increase new\_len gradually, a value of
0x04000000 < new\_len <= 0x08000000 will try to g\_realloc
0x08000000 \* 0x14 = 0xa0000000 (3 GB) which seems very unlikely to succeed,
and failure results in an abort.
pango\_ot\_buffer\_output will set new\_len to HB\_Buffer::in\_length. But it looks
like this will only be a large as a successful allocation of
n \* sizeof(HB\_GlyphItemRec). HB\_GlyphItemRec seems to need 0x12 bytes, which
I assume would align to 0x14, so an allocation of at least 0x08000001 \* 0x14 =
0xa0000014 (>3GB) must succeed before new\_len will be >= 0x08000001 in
pango\_glyph\_string\_set\_size. (The size of the HB\_GlyphItemRec buffer is
increased gradually.)
\_pango\_shape\_shape is only called from pango-layout, which Mozilla only uses
through GTK (not through our text code), and only when the text has
PANGO\_ATTR\_SHAPE.

Hi Karl -- Thanks for the thorough analysis/explanation. I completely admit I've been lazy on this one, and most of my time was spent looking at the apple side of things (as that is what led to the discovery). I've only had one SIGSEGV with FF, and I'm pretty sure it is unrelated [and, so far, unreproducible].
So, in short:
- FF+pango: allocation crash/dos only(\*)
- Camino+ripc: sigsegvs with some ability to control; possibly exploitable
[\*] Note, it is possible to also dos ff using large runs of "A\n" in a html node as it will add/remove the nodes over and over again up to whatever huge string size without triggering the javascript timeout: <http://static.dataspill.org/glyph/pango_mac_alloc_loop.html>
Behdad -- Awesome! I'm glad to see the patch heading upstream. When is 1.24 planned to go out?
thanks!

Just to make sure I'm understanding correctly: Camino would need to cap the length of every single string that might ever come from Core and end up being displayed in the UI? And doing so removes exploitability even if other Core crashes related to ginormous strings remain unfixed on the 1.9.0 branch?
(Or alternately, Camino could presumably wait for an OS update... do you know specifically what versions of the OS are vulnerable?)

No. There is nothing Camino-specific here other than that the bug reporter has failed to reproduce their particular bug in Firefox for some reason. We can mitigate this in Core.

If part of the bug is that Apple libraries will crash when given incredibly long strings, which seems to be what [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=480134#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap/integer overflows during font glyph rendering reachable in FF and Camino (libpango, CoreGraphics)") is saying, then how does [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=480134#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Heap/integer overflows during font glyph rendering reachable in FF and Camino (libpango, CoreGraphics)") address the entire problem for Camino? There is no direct Core-to-platform-font-engine interface in the case of the URL bar; Core gives Camino the string, and Camino gives it to the OS to render (through native controls).

Ah, that's true. You can't trust Apple's text drawing APIs so whenever you use them directly, you'll have to do something. Core can't help there.

So it sounds like the Core fixes here are:

- On Linux, no Core fixes, just depend on the fix being in pango 1.24

Since there was no fanfare for the pango 1.24 release and FF/linux won't be making any changes (it seems), I'll drop a line to various vendors soon to let them know that they may want to backport the pango fix. It'd be nice to be able to give them the option to do so before this bug becomes public (even if they choose not to fix it).

Going to <http://static.dataspill.org/glyph/pango_2.html>, causing the latest 1.9.0 build to peg the cpu above 90%, use over 2 GB of RAM, and become non-responsive: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.12pre) Gecko/2009063004 GranParadiso/3.0.12pre. I don't get an actual crash but a complete hang. This does not appear to be fixed.

I see a CPU and memory spike, but after 10-15 seconds the CPU comes back and the memory is released when I close the tab. If you've got less than the amount of memory it's trying to use you might hit swapping/performance problems, but that isn't this bug.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-36

## Heap/integer overflows in font glyph rendering libraries

Announced
July 21, 2009
Reporter
Will Drewry
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.12
* Firefox 3.5

### Description

oCERT security researcher **Will Drewry** reported a
series of heap and integer overflow vulnerabilities which
independently affected multiple font glyph rendering libraries. On
Linux platforms libpango was susceptible to the vulnerabilities while
on OS X CoreGraphics was similarly vulnerable. An attacker could
trigger these overflows by constructing a very large text run for the
browser to display. Such an overflow can result in a crash which the
attacker could potentially use to run arbitrary code on a victim's
computer.

The open-source nature of Linux meant that Mozilla was able to work
with the `libpango` maintainers to implement the correct fix
in version 1.24 of that system library which was distributed with OS
security updates. On Mac OS X Firefox works around the CoreGraphics
flaw by limiting the length of text runs passed to the system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
