  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-2468",
      "affected_product": "Safari 4.0.3, Mac OS X, Mac OS X Server",
      "vulnerability_description": "A heap buffer overflow exists in the drawing of long text strings. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.",
      "root_cause": "Heap buffer overflow in CoreGraphics when drawing long text strings.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking."
       ],
      "impact": "Unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "Visiting a maliciously crafted website.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious website with long text strings to trigger the overflow.",
      "additional_notes": "The issue is addressed through improved bounds checking. Credit to Will Drewry of Google Inc for reporting this issue. This issue does not affect Mac OS X v10.6 systems."

    {
        "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1194",
        "affected_product": "Firefox, Camino, libpango",
        "vulnerability_description": "Heap/integer overflows during font glyph rendering reachable in FF and Camino (libpango, CoreGraphics)",
        "root_cause": "Integer overflow in libpango's pango_glyph_string_set_size function when doubling the size neglects the overflow possible on the subsequent allocation. Also, a similar issue in Apple's CoreGraphics(ripc).",
       "weaknesses": [
            "Integer overflow in pango_glyph_string_set_size",
            "Lack of proper handling of large strings by Apple's CoreGraphics"
       ],
        "impact": "Heap corruption, application crash, potential arbitrary code execution.  Camino is reported to be more vulnerable with sigsevs and some control.",
        "attack_vector": "By constructing a very large text run for the browser to display, triggered via javascript manipulating document.location.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the text run content and length by injecting code into a web page.",
        "additional_notes": "Mozilla worked with libpango maintainers to implement the correct fix in version 1.24. Firefox works around the CoreGraphics flaw by limiting the length of text runs passed to the system. This issue was also reported to Apple, but no timeline was given for a fix."
