Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2009-2382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insecure cookie handling in `phpMyBlockchecker` version 1.0.0055. The application uses a cookie named `PHPMYBCAdmin` to verify if the user is logged in as an administrator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The application checks the presence of the `PHPMYBCAdmin` cookie with a value of `LOGGEDIN` to grant admin access. However, it does not validate the source or integrity of the cookie. This allows an attacker to forge the cookie with the correct value, bypassing the login procedure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A malicious user can gain administrator access to the `phpMyBlockchecker` application without authenticating.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Once authenticated as an administrator, an attacker can perform administrative tasks, potentially leading to further compromise of the application or the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `PHPMYBCAdmin` cookie by setting it to `LOGGEDIN`. This can be done using client-side scripting or through browser developer tools.
- **Direct Request:** After setting the cookie, the attacker can directly request the admin page (`admin.php`) and gain access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set a cookie in their browser for the domain hosting the vulnerable `phpMyBlockchecker` application.
- No prior authentication is needed; this vulnerability is an authentication bypass itself.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability lies within this section of the `admin.php` script:
```php
if ($_COOKIE[PHPMYBCAdmin] == '') {
    if (!$_POST[login] == 'login') {
        die("Please Login:<BR><form method=post><input type=password
        name=password><input type=hidden value=login name=login><input
        type=submit></form>");
    } elseif($_POST[password] == $bcadminpass) {
        setcookie("PHPMYBCAdmin","LOGGEDIN", time() + 60 * 60);
        header("Location: admin.php"); 
    } else { 
        die("Incorrect"); 
    }
}
```

This code checks if the `PHPMYBCAdmin` cookie is empty. If it is, it either prompts for login or checks the password provided against `$bcadminpass` to set the cookie. However, if the `PHPMYBCAdmin` cookie exists, regardless of the value, the authentication is bypassed.

**Exploit (Proof of Concept):**
The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to set the cookie:

```javascript
javascript:document.cookie = "PHPMYBCAdmin=LOGGEDIN; path=/";
document.cookie = "1246371700; path=/";
```
This Javascript code sets the `PHPMYBCAdmin` cookie to `LOGGEDIN` and sets another cookie, likely for some time-based purpose, which may not be essential for the exploit.

In summary, this vulnerability allows an attacker to easily bypass the admin login by setting a cookie with the correct name and value. The application does not properly validate the cookie, and it trusts client-provided data to determine admin access.
