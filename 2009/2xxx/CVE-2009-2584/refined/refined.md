Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-2584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the SGI GRU driver in the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `options_write` function in `drivers/misc/sgi-gru/gruprocfs.c` did not properly validate the length of user-supplied data when setting options.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Off-by-One Write:** The `options_write` function uses `copy_from_user()` to copy user-provided data into a buffer. While it checks the size of the copy, the subsequent null termination (`buf[count - 1] = '';`) does not perform this same size check, resulting in a potential off-by-one write.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The driver does not validate the user-provided `count` value before using it to index the buffer, thus leading to the off-by-one write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Root Privilege Escalation:** The off-by-one write allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary locations in kernel memory by writing a null byte, which can be leveraged to achieve root privileges.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting critical kernel data structures can also result in a system crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   **Procfs File:** The attacker must have write access to the relevant procfs file for the SGI GRU driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **Write Permissions:** The attacker must have write permissions to the procfs file associated with the SGI GRU driver.
*   **Knowledge of Kernel Memory Layout (Optional):** While not strictly required for a DoS, gaining root privileges may require a more advanced attacker with knowledge of kernel memory layout to overwrite relevant data structures such as function pointers or credentials.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04.
*   A patch was released that initializes the buffer to zero, eliminates the need for the buggy null termination and uses `strncpy_from_user` to avoid the issue.
*   The content from xorl.wordpress.com provides an in-depth analysis of the vulnerable code, the fix, and potential exploitation strategies, including discussion on overwriting function pointers or user credentials.
*   The discussion in the comments of the xorl blog highlights that the vulnerability can be exploited in multiple ways and that it is relatively trivial for those with knowledge of kernel exploitation. The blog also suggests ways to reliably locate the buffer, as well as other exploitation techniques
