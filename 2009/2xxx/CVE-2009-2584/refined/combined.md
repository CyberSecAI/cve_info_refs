## Details

Solar Designer discovered that the z90crypt driver did not correctly

check capabilities. A local attacker could exploit this to shut down

the device, leading to a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06.

([CVE-2009-1883](/security/CVE-2009-1883))

Michael Buesch discovered that the SGI GRU driver did not correctly check

the length when setting options. A local attacker could exploit this

to write to the kernel stack, leading to root privilege escalation or

a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2584](/security/CVE-2009-2584))

It was discovered that SELinux did not fully implement the mmap\_min\_addr

restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to allocate the

NULL memory page which could lead to further attacks against kernel

NULL-dereference vulnerabilities. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected.

([CVE-2009-2695](/security/CVE-2009-2695))

Cagri Coltekin discovered that the UDP stack did not correctly handle

certain flags. A local user could send specially crafted commands and

traffic to gain root privileges or crash the systeam, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06. ([CVE-2009-2698](/security/CVE-2009-2698))

Hiroshi Shimamoto discovered that monotonic timers did not correctly

validate parameters. A local user could make a specially crafted timer

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2767](/security/CVE-2009-2767))

Michael Buesch discovered that the HPPA ISA EEPROM driver did not

correctly validate positions. A local user could make a specially crafted

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2846](/security/CVE-2009-2846))

Ulrich Drepper discovered that kernel signal stacks were not being

correctly padded on 64-bit systems. A local attacker could send specially

crafted calls to expose 4 bytes of kernel stack memory, leading to a

loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-2847](/security/CVE-2009-2847))

Jens Rosenboom discovered that the clone method did not correctly clear

certain fields. A local attacker could exploit this to gain privileges

or crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-2848](/security/CVE-2009-2848))

It was discovered that the MD driver did not check certain sysfs files.

A local attacker with write access to /sys could exploit this to cause

a system crash, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 6.06 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-2849](/security/CVE-2009-2849))

Mark Smith discovered that the AppleTalk stack did not correctly

manage memory. A remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic

to cause the system to consume all available memory, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2903](/security/CVE-2009-2903))

Lo√Øc Minier discovered that eCryptfs did not correctly handle writing

to certain deleted files. A local attacker could exploit this to gain

root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-2908](/security/CVE-2009-2908))

It was discovered that the LLC, AppleTalk, IR, EConet, Netrom, and

ROSE network stacks did not correctly initialize their data structures.

A local attacker could make specially crafted calls to read kernel memory,

leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3001](/security/CVE-2009-3001), [CVE-2009-3002](/security/CVE-2009-3002))

It was discovered that the randomization used for Address Space Layout

Randomization was predictable within a small window of time. A local

attacker could exploit this to leverage further attacks that require

knowledge of userspace memory layouts. ([CVE-2009-3238](/security/CVE-2009-3238))

Eric Paris discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly handle file creation

failures. An attacker with write access to an NFSv4 share could exploit

this to create files with arbitrary mode bits, leading to privilege

escalation or a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3286](/security/CVE-2009-3286))

Bob Tracy discovered that the SCSI generic driver did not correctly use

the right index for array access. A local attacker with write access

to a CDR could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 9.04 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3288](/security/CVE-2009-3288))

Jan Kiszka discovered that KVM did not correctly validate certain

hypercalls. A local unprivileged attacker in a virtual guest could exploit

this to crash the guest kernel, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu

6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3290](/security/CVE-2009-3290))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Linux kernel SGI GRU Driver Off-by-One¬†Overwrite

[with 13 comments](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/linux-kernel-sgi-gru-driver-off-by-one-overwrite/#comments)

This bug was [reported by Michael Buesch](http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/7/20/348). You can find the vulnerable code at drivers/misc/sgi-gru/gruprocfs.c and specifically, here is that code from 2.6.30 release of the Linux kernel.

static ssize\_t options\_write(struct file \*file, const char \_\_user \*userbuf,

size\_t count, loff\_t \*data)

{

unsigned long val;

char buf[80];

if (copy\_from\_user

(buf, userbuf, count < sizeof(buf) ? count : sizeof(buf)))
return -EFAULT;
buf[count - 1] = '';
if (!strict\_strtoul(buf, 10, &val))
gru\_options = val;
return count;
}
[/sourcecode]
This function is used to handle write operations to the equivalent procfs file. As you can see, it invokes copy\_from\_user() using user controlled 'count' only if this is less than sizeof(buf), that is 80 according to the previous allocation. However, the NULL termination does not perform the same check and directly uses the user controlled 'count' minus one. Because of this, a user with +w access to that procfs file can write a NULL byte to arbitrary locations in kernel memory. The patch is:
[sourcecode language="c"]
+ memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
if (strncpy\_from\_user(buf, userbuf, sizeof(buf) - 1) < 0)
return -EFAULT;
- buf[count - 1] = '';
if (!strict\_strtoul(buf, 10, &val))
[/sourcecode]
Which initializes the whole 'buf' to zero, thus no need for NULL termination and removes the buggy code.

1. I know where I would write one! ;)

   Maybe I‚Äôll write the exploit for fun, reusing cheddar\_bay, since exploitation with this one is trivial :p

3. spender there are numerous ways to exploit this :)

   One simple way is trigger a dereference by overwriting 1 byte of an address (offset from buf[] in this case) of a function pointer and then mmap() to that location your evil code and finally trigger a call to that function pointer.

5. Can you know buf 100% reliably though? I thought of an idea to know buf 100% reliably, then you would reliably overwrite the highest byte in a rarely-used (but non-zero) file\_operations fptr, and then rinse and repeat the old cheddar bay code :p

   -Brad

   **[spender](http://grsecurity.net)**

   July 21, 2009 at [12:23](#comment-317)
7. No, I don‚Äôt know 100% reliably the location of buf[], using your way of course you have to overcome any mmap\_min\_addr since the function pointer you mention will be dereferenced to NULL. Of course, since you already have cheddar bay ready it‚Äôs not that hard :P

   Nevertheless, I think it would be much better if you overwrite a function pointer outside mmap\_min\_addr range since you‚Äôll not have to mess with it at all.

9. Why will it be dereferenced to NULL? It can‚Äôt in fact, or it wouldn‚Äôt be used. What I would do is target some fptr which I know points to some known function that I have the symbol (and thus the address for). So then I can mask off bytes using separate 0 writes and thus wind up with an address like 0x00ab0000 or something of the sort, do my mmap there (which is above mmap\_min\_addr) and away we go ;)

   Let‚Äôs go talk about copy\_from\_user :p

11. Oh.. that‚Äôs what I meant in my first comment.

    Sorry for the misunderstanding :P

    Once again I‚Äôm not home right now, I‚Äôll login to talk to you tonight if I can (tonight means about 22:00-23:00 local time, where local time is Athens, Greece :P)

13. I‚Äôd stay on the stack.

15. @qaaz: I‚Äôm not really sure that I get what you mean by ‚Äústaying on the stack‚Äù. Probably overwriting something which is close to buf[] on the stack but as I said, I‚Äôm not 100% sure that this is what you meant.

17. here‚Äôs my exploit ;)

    <http://grsecurity.net/~spender/exploit_demo.c>

    It would be a real one but this driver only works on some special SGI x86 architecture. If anyone actually has this hardware they can make the modifications mentioned to my exploit and have something that works reliably :p

19. Hola people,

    Why not use this null byte to overwrite task\_struct->cred->uid directly instead of MMAPing a code and jumping there? We are going for root after all, right? :-) Of course, one must locate the address of the task‚Äôs task\_struct in order to use this technique (via an info leak maybe?). I am still practicing my kernel skills, so, maybe I am wrong.

    Btw, spender, can you probably tell us more about how to reliably locate buf[]? Sounds interesting.

    **[huku](https://www.grhack.net)**

    July 26, 2009 at [21:43](#comment-340)
21. @huku: I thought about that as well, you now, the elegant BSD way but this will require at lest two overwrites since in most cases UIDs are like 1000 or something, so in hex you have 0x000003EB. In addition to this, this is not a 100% arbitrary overwrite since write(2) doesn‚Äôt allow negative integers, this limits you to 0-0x80000000 offsets. If you can reliably find your task‚Äôs UID there then it would be neat.

    I think I can answer spender‚Äôs question as well, you can also read his PoC/sample-exploit code posted above. He allocates 1GB of memory and then performs a write to the procfs file with a count in the range of his allocated space. The kernel will page this page since it was touched and using mincore(2) spender‚Äôs exploit locates the altered page. This gives more or less, the location of buf[]. Then since he knows in which page to look, he uses a for loop which fills that page with non-zero data and does a zero write to buf[] and attempts to find the zero in that page. This is what he does to find the location of his write operation in buf[] which is really cool I think. :)

    spender, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.

23. I couldn‚Äôt sleep and decided to have a look at spender‚Äôs PoC. Indeed, using mincore() in order to locate the paged-in page is really neat. Very cool idea.

    **[huku](https://www.grhack.net)**

    July 27, 2009 at [01:04](#comment-343)
25. can we monitor the write operation in linux. all i want is to control the write operation or monitor all the write operation done by the system.

    plz do help me out.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
