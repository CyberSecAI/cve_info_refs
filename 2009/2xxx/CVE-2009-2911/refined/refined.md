Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2911:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2009-2911 lies in multiple denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities within the SystemTap instrumentation system, specifically when the `--unprivileged` mode is activated. These vulnerabilities stem from insufficient checks and limitations on user-provided input and data sizes during runtime.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Kernel stack overflow via excessive `print` arguments:** A large number of parameters passed to the `print*` function could overflow the kernel stack.
2.  **Kernel stack frame overflow with crafted DWARF:** Maliciously crafted DWARF (Debugging With Attributed Record Formats) information provided by the user could cause a stack frame overflow.
3.  **Missing unwind table size checks:** Absence of proper checks on the maximum size of the unwind table and the size of CIE/CFI records within it could cause infinite loops or other forms of DoS during processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to a denial of service. Specifically:

*   **Kernel stack overflows** can crash the system or allow for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Stack frame overflows** caused by crafted DWARF data lead to system instability/crashes.
*   **Missing size checks** can cause the system to enter an infinite loop, effectively hanging the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors are local and require the `--unprivileged` mode to be enabled by a privileged user beforehand:

1.  **Excessive `print` arguments:** A user could craft a SystemTap script with a `print*` statement containing a large number of parameters.
2.  **Crafted DWARF information:**  A malicious user could provide a specially crafted DWARF data, triggering stack overflows
3.  **Large unwind tables:** A crafted module with a large unwind table could trigger a denial of service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker must be able to execute SystemTap scripts locally on the target system.
*   **`--unprivileged` mode:** The `--unprivileged` mode has to be activated by a privileged user first.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   Patches address the issues by enforcing limits:
    *   Limit on the number of arguments in a `print` call (max 32 args, max 256 bytes on the stack).
    *   Limit on the stack depth used in DWARF expressions during variable access.
    *   Limit on the size of the unwind tables and CFI processing.
    *   Introduction of `-Wframe-larger-than` option to ensure stack frames do not become too large.

*   The vulnerabilities do not affect the SystemTap versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 but impact Fedora releases 10 and 11.
