# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-10-15 10:30:15 UTC  ``` Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the SystemTap instrumentation system, when the --unprivileged mode was activated:  a, Kernel stack overflow allows local attackers to cause denial of service or execute arbitrary code via long number of parameters, provided to the print* call.  b, Kernel stack frame overflow allows local attackers to cause denial  of service via specially-crafted user-provided DWARF information.  c, Absent check(s) for the upper bound of the size of the unwind table    and for the upper bound of the size of each of the CIE/CFI records, could     allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).  References: ----------- <http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10750> <http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=41633>  Issue severity note: -------------------- The --unprivileged mode needs to be activated by the privileged user prior the unprivileged user could exploit these flaws.  SystemTap 1.0 in the default configuration is not shipped with the --unprivileged mode activated, this is NOT vulnerable to  these flaws.  Information about vulnerable versions: -------------------------------------- These issues do NOT affect the versions of SystemTap instrumentation system, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.  These issues affect the versions of SystemTap instrumentation system, as shipped with Fedora releases of 10 and 11.  See also above severity note.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c4)  Josh Stone    2009-10-20 01:55:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 365293](attachment.cgi?id=365293&action=diff "Limit printf arguments") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=365293&action=edit "Limit printf arguments") Limit printf arguments  This patch for SystemTap enforces a limit on the number of arguments in a print call, and also forces a tighter -Wframe-larger-than constraint than the default kernel build.  This addresses all issues in sourceware #10750. <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10750>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c5)  Josh Stone    2009-10-20 02:01:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 365294](attachment.cgi?id=365294&action=diff "Limit DWARF expression stack size") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=365294&action=edit "Limit DWARF expression stack size") Limit DWARF expression stack size  This patch for SystemTap enforces a limit on how deep a stack can be used in the DWARF expressions that read probe variables.  It is a combination of upstream commit 85dfc5c8 which started reporting the stack size, and a new check to put an upper bound on that.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c6)  Mark Wielaard    2009-10-20 19:26:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 365413](attachment.cgi?id=365413&action=diff "Unwind table size checks patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=365413&action=edit "Unwind table size checks patch") Unwind table size checks patch  This patch adds a limit on the maximum size of the unwind tables we load this limits the amount of processing we do (scanning through the CIEs for an address in a module for which we want to backtrace). There are checks added for making sure the CIEs we find are actually inside the unwind table we are processing. And checks to make sure we only scan data until an end that falls within the same table. Finally a limit on the number of call frame instructions we process (hardcoded at 512 atm).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c8)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-21 16:22:48 UTC  ``` systemtap-1.0-2.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/systemtap-1.0-2.fc11>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c9)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-21 16:22:56 UTC  ``` systemtap-1.0-2.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/systemtap-1.0-2.fc10>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c10)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-21 16:23:04 UTC  ``` systemtap-1.0-2.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/systemtap-1.0-2.fc12>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c11)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-27 06:27:56 UTC  ``` systemtap-1.0-2.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=41633#c0)  Frank Ch. Eigler    2009-10-08 18:57:51 UTC  ``` gcc should warn when the stack frame for a called varargs function is in excess of a -Wframe-larger-than=NNN bytes.  Such a check could be done at each call site, to see whether the outgoing arguments alone already exhaust NNN. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=41633#c1)  Frank Ch. Eigler    2009-11-02 16:43:28 UTC  ``` Please be aware that the linux kernel uses this flag in its builds as a tool to help limit runtime stack consumption, as a safety/security matter.  So it goes beyond a "nice to have".  ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=41633#c2)  Frank Ch. Eigler    2010-11-05 18:12:22 UTC  ``` Still present as of gcc 4.5. ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-10-15 10:30:15 UTC  ``` Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the SystemTap instrumentation system, when the --unprivileged mode was activated:  a, Kernel stack overflow allows local attackers to cause denial of service or execute arbitrary code via long number of parameters, provided to the print* call.  b, Kernel stack frame overflow allows local attackers to cause denial  of service via specially-crafted user-provided DWARF information.  c, Absent check(s) for the upper bound of the size of the unwind table    and for the upper bound of the size of each of the CIE/CFI records, could     allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).  References: ----------- <http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10750> <http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=41633>  Issue severity note: -------------------- The --unprivileged mode needs to be activated by the privileged user prior the unprivileged user could exploit these flaws.  SystemTap 1.0 in the default configuration is not shipped with the --unprivileged mode activated, this is NOT vulnerable to  these flaws.  Information about vulnerable versions: -------------------------------------- These issues do NOT affect the versions of SystemTap instrumentation system, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.  These issues affect the versions of SystemTap instrumentation system, as shipped with Fedora releases of 10 and 11.  See also above severity note.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c4)  Josh Stone    2009-10-20 01:55:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 365293](attachment.cgi?id=365293&action=diff "Limit printf arguments") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=365293&action=edit "Limit printf arguments") Limit printf arguments  This patch for SystemTap enforces a limit on the number of arguments in a print call, and also forces a tighter -Wframe-larger-than constraint than the default kernel build.  This addresses all issues in sourceware #10750. <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10750>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c5)  Josh Stone    2009-10-20 02:01:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 365294](attachment.cgi?id=365294&action=diff "Limit DWARF expression stack size") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=365294&action=edit "Limit DWARF expression stack size") Limit DWARF expression stack size  This patch for SystemTap enforces a limit on how deep a stack can be used in the DWARF expressions that read probe variables.  It is a combination of upstream commit 85dfc5c8 which started reporting the stack size, and a new check to put an upper bound on that.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c6)  Mark Wielaard    2009-10-20 19:26:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 365413](attachment.cgi?id=365413&action=diff "Unwind table size checks patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=365413&action=edit "Unwind table size checks patch") Unwind table size checks patch  This patch adds a limit on the maximum size of the unwind tables we load this limits the amount of processing we do (scanning through the CIEs for an address in a module for which we want to backtrace). There are checks added for making sure the CIEs we find are actually inside the unwind table we are processing. And checks to make sure we only scan data until an end that falls within the same table. Finally a limit on the number of call frame instructions we process (hardcoded at 512 atm).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c8)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-21 16:22:48 UTC  ``` systemtap-1.0-2.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/systemtap-1.0-2.fc11>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c9)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-21 16:22:56 UTC  ``` systemtap-1.0-2.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/systemtap-1.0-2.fc10>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c10)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-21 16:23:04 UTC  ``` systemtap-1.0-2.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/systemtap-1.0-2.fc12>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=529175#c11)  Fedora Update System    2009-10-27 06:27:56 UTC  ``` systemtap-1.0-2.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.
