  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection flaw within the `reputation.php` mod of PunBB.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Blind SQL Injection"
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database. In this specific case the provided exploit targets the `password` field of the `users` table.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is accessible via the `reputation.php` script through a crafted POST request to change a user's reputation, specifically within the 'poster' parameter."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to have a valid user account in the PunBB forum.",
        "The attacker must be able to send crafted POST requests to the vulnerable `reputation.php` endpoint.",
        "The attacker should know the target user id they want to extract the password for."
      ],
      "exploit_details": "The provided Perl script automates the blind SQL injection attack. It iterates through possible characters of the target password by injecting a crafted SQL query into the `poster` parameter of the reputation change request. It measures the response time of each request to determine if a character matches. Once a character is found the script continues to the next one.",
        "additional_notes":"The exploit uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique to retrieve the password, as there are no direct error messages. The exploit leverages the fact that the reputation change is not directly visible and that the code has a delay based on the execution time. This makes it possible to check if the injection is correct by observing the delay."
