The provided content pertains to two CVEs: CVE-2009-2402 and CVE-2009-2401. This response focuses solely on CVE-2009-2401 based on the instructions.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The PHPEcho CMS 2.0-rc3 application's forum module is vulnerable to both Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Blind SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The forum allows the insertion of JavaScript and HTML code, leading to the possibility of malicious script execution in the context of other users.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the 'id' parameter in the forum thread display functionality, allowing an attacker to infer information about the database structure and potentially extract data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:**
    - Cookie Stealing: An attacker can steal user session cookies by injecting a script that sends the cookie data to a malicious server, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    - Malicious code execution: Arbitrary JavaScript code can be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to further attacks.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** An attacker can infer information about the database structure and potentially extract sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the forum, which will be executed when other users view the affected content.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** By manipulating the 'id' parameter in the URL, an attacker can send crafted SQL queries to the database and observe the application's response to deduce information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to post or inject content into the forum for the XSS attack or craft the URL for blind SQL injection
- The attacker does not require any special privileges beyond that to post content on the forum or craft a valid URL
