  "cveId": "CVE-2009-2691",
  "date": "2009-08-11",
  "description": "Kees Cook and Steve Beattie discovered a race condition in the /proc code in the Linux kernel. This could lead to information in the \"/proc/[pid]/maps\" and \"/proc/[pid]/smaps\" files being leaked to users (who would otherwise not have access to this information) during ELF loading. This could help a local attacker bypass the ASLR security feature.",
  "affectedProduct": "Linux kernel",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "A race condition exists during ELF loading where /proc/$pid/maps and /proc/$pid/smaps files are readable before privilege separation is established.",
    "weakness": "Information disclosure",
    "impact": "A local attacker can bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature by reading memory layout information of a privileged process during its initial startup.",
    "attackVector": "Local access to the system is required.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to execute a program and read from /proc file system. They do not need any specific privileges prior to exploitation."
