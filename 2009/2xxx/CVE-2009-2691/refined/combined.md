RHSA-2009:1540 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2009-11-03
Updated:
2009-11-03
# RHSA-2009:1540 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix several security issues, multiple bugs,
and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.1.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* the ADDR\_COMPAT\_LAYOUT and MMAP\_PAGE\_ZERO flags were not cleared when a

setuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to bypass the mmap\_min\_addr protection mechanism and perform a
NULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)

* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local

users in the unconfined\_t domain to map low memory areas even if the
mmap\_min\_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local
exploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in getname() implementations in

numerous network protocol implementations in the Linux kernel. Certain
data structures in these getname() implementations were not initialized
properly before being copied to user-space. These flaws could lead to an
information leak. (CVE-2009-3002, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux

kernel. pci\_unmap\_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
abuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.
(CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the r128 driver in the

Linux kernel. Checks to test if the Concurrent Command Engine state was
initialized were missing in private IOCTL functions. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a local denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2009-3620, Important)

* Kees Cook and Steve Beattie discovered a race condition in the /proc

code in the Linux kernel. This could lead to information in the
"/proc/[pid]/maps" and "/proc/[pid]/smaps" files being leaked to users (who
would otherwise not have access to this information) during ELF loading.
This could help a local attacker bypass the ASLR security feature.
(CVE-2009-2691, Moderate)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the md driver in the Linux

kernel. If the suspend\_lo or suspend\_hi file in "/sys/" is modified when
the disk array is inactive, it could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. By default, only root can write to these two files.
(CVE-2009-2849, Moderate)

* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,

32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. (CVE-2009-2910, Moderate)

* padding data in several core network structures was not initialized

properly before being sent to user-space, possibly leading to information
leaks. (CVE-2009-3228, CVE-2009-3612, Moderate)

* the unix\_stream\_connect() function in the Linux kernel did not check if a

UNIX domain socket was in the shutdown state. This could lead to a
deadlock. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2009-3621, Moderate)

These updated packages also include bug fixes and enhancements. Users are
directed to the Realtime Security Update Release Notes for version 1.1 for
information on these changes, which will be available shortly from:

<http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_MRG/>

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues and add enhancements. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=517830#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-17 12:28:34 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Dan Walsh's blog post mentioned in the previous comment details selinux-policy part of the issue tracked via [bug #512284](show_bug.cgi?id=512284 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2009-1897 kernel: tun/tap: Fix crashes if open() /dev/net/tun and then poll() it").  As noted in the the blog, selinux-policy provides a boolean - allow_unconfined_mmap_low - which controls whether mmap_min_addr restriction is applied to the process.  This boolean, however, did not work as expected, as unconfined_t domain (default domain for logged-in unprivileged users) was always permitted to map low memory pages regardless of the boolean setting.  This problem with the boolean is being fixed and the fix will be included in future selinux-policy updates in RHEL5 and Fedora (see Dan's blog for NVRs).  Few notes specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5: Support for mmap_min_addr sysctl was not included in the GA version of RHEL5.  It was only added in kernel update in 5.2 (it first appeared upstream in 2.6.24).  selinux-policy was, to avoid breaking applications needing low memory pages mapping on upgrade from 5.1 to 5.2, configured to allow mmap_zero in unconfined domains and only disallow it in confined domains (e.g. various network facing services).  In 5.3, allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean was added, but it's default value for targeted policy was changed to on, i.e. allowing mmap_zero in all unconfined domains by default.  This default boolean value is planned to remain unchanged in 5.4.  It should also be noted, that even with allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean set to off, it is still possible for unconfined_t user to transition to other domain that is permitted to mmap_zero, as details in the Dan's blog post.  Upstream discussion on how to best address this issue is still ongoing.  Eric's proposed patches moving mmap_min_addr check out of security were submitted.  If they are accepted upstream, mmap_min_addr will be checked before LSM hooks are called.  Security modules will only be consulted if mmap_min_addr check has passed (e.g. when mmap_min_addr is 0), so SELinux may still be able to restrict mapping of the low pages / zero page for confined domains and permit mapping in unconfined, even when mmap_min_addr is 0.  Eric's patches with further discussion: <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36540/> <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36539/>  Updated version: <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36650/> <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36649/>  Further discussion of the proposed change: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.lsm/9075>  mmap_min_addr on SELinux and non-SELinux systems <http://eparis.livejournal.com/606.html>  Confining the unconfined.

Cox    2009-08-17 15:33:10 UTC  ``` CVE-2009-2695: A system with SELinux enabled with the default targeted policy is more permissive for unconfined domains, allowing local users to map low memory areas even if mmap_min_addr protection is enabled.  This could allow the exploitation of NULL pointer dereference flaws.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=517830#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-19 05:52:00 UTC  ``` Upstream commits: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/9c0d90103c7e0eb6e638e5b649e9f6d8d9c1b4b3> <http://git.kernel.org/linus/8cf948e744e0218af604c32edecde10006dc8e9e> <http://git.kernel.org/linus/788084aba2ab7348257597496befcbccabdc98a3> <http://git.kernel.org/linus/1d9959734a1949ea4f2427bd2d8b21ede6b2441c>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=517830#c11)  Fedora Update System    2009-08-27 02:19:16 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.29.6-217.2.16.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <4A80E2B8.2090709@redhat.com>
Date: Tue, 11 Aug 2009 11:17:12 +0800

CC: "Steven M. Christey" <coley@...us.mitre.org>, Kees Cook <kees@...ntu.com>
Subject: CVE-2009-2691 kernel: /proc/$pid/maps visible during initial setuid
 ELF loading

Steve Beattie and Kees Cook noticed that the /proc/$pid/maps and smaps
files are readable during ELF loading for processes that a user should
not normally be able to see (for example, when launching a setuid process).

I have assigned this with CVE-2009-2691.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
