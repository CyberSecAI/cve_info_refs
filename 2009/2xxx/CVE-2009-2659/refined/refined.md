Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2009-2659:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Django development server's handler for serving static media files did not properly validate the requested URL. Specifically, it failed to verify if the requested URL actually corresponded to a legitimate static media file used by Django.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation of the requested URL
- The development server does not properly check if requested URLs correspond to valid static media files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL to access and serve any file on the filesystem to which the Django development server process has read access. This could expose sensitive information and potentially lead to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing a malicious URL to the Django development server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Django development server. This server is typically only exposed on the local loopback interface by default, limiting the attack to the local machine. However, if the server was configured to listen on a public or network-accessible interface, it would become remotely exploitable.
