- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CQWeb server in IBM Rational ClearQuest has security vulnerabilities related to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and potential disclosure of usernames or passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and "Possible Username or Password Disclosure"
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute malicious scripts in a user's browser (XSS) or gain access to sensitive user credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vectors are not detailed in the provided content, but they would likely involve exploiting the web interface of the CQWeb server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need the ability to send requests to the vulnerable CQWeb server. The specific capabilities needed would depend on the exact nature of the XSS vulnerability. For the password disclosure, the attacker would need to have the ability to intercept or access data from the vulnerable server.
