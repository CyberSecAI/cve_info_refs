How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with

## Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
the [download
page](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html) on the main web site.

### Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages
can be found on the
[download page](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html#otherplat) on the Wireshark web site.

## File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.

## Known Problems

Wireshark may appear offscreen on multi-monitor Windows systems.
([Bug
553](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=553))

Wireshark might make your system disassociate from a wireless network
on OS X.
([Bug
1315](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1315))

Dumpcap might not quit if Wireshark or TShark crashes.
([Bug
1419](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1419))

The BER dissector might infinitely loop.
([Bug
1516](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1516))

Wireshark can't dynamically update the packet list. This means that host
name resolutions above a certain response time threshold won't show up in
the packet list.
([Bug
1605](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1605))

Capture filters aren't applied when capturing from named pipes.
([Bug

Wireshark might freeze when reading from a pipe.
([Bug
2082](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2082))

Capturing from named pipes might be delayed on Windows.
([Bug
2200](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2200))
