Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2563:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Infiniband dissector in Wireshark has a flaw that can lead to a crash on certain platforms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Infiniband dissector's code, which is responsible for interpreting Infiniband network traffic.
- A malformed Infiniband packet can trigger the flaw in the dissector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of the vulnerability results in a crash of the Wireshark application.
- This can lead to a denial-of-service condition where the user cannot effectively analyze network traffic.
- It can also potentially interrupt on-going capture sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack can be performed by crafting a malformed Infiniband packet.
- This can be done remotely if the attacker can inject such a packet into network traffic that is being monitored by Wireshark.
- It can also be achieved locally by convincing a user to open a capture file containing the malformed packet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to either:
  - Inject a crafted Infiniband packet into network traffic being captured by Wireshark or
  - Create a malformed pcap file that the user would open with Wireshark.
- The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges on the target system, but the user must be running a vulnerable version of Wireshark.

**Affected Versions:**
- Wireshark versions 0.9.2 up to and including 1.0.8, and 1.2.0.

**Fixed Versions:**
- Wireshark 1.0.9 and later versions contain the fix for this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- Disabling the Infiniband dissector can be a workaround if upgrading is not immediately possible.
- The vulnerability is specific to the Infiniband dissector which may or may not be enabled by default.
