#### I. Background

Quoting Wikipedia "ECMAScript is a scripting language, standardized by Ecma
International in the ECMA-262 specification and ISO/IEC 16262. The language
is widely used on the web, especially in the form of its three best-known
dialects, JavaScript, ActionScript, and JScript."
#### II. Description

Calling the select() method with a large integer, results in continuous
allocation of x+n bytes of memory exhausting memory after a while.

The impact varies from null pointer dereference (no more memory,hence
crashing the browser) to the reboot of the complete Operation System
(Konqueror&Ubuntu).

There had never been a limit specified as to how many html elements the select call should handle, after the report of this Bug, vendors apparently agreed to a
limit of 10.000 elements : "Talked to some Apple and Opera guys at the
WHATWG social, and we decided this was a good number"

#### III. Impact

The impact
varies from browser to browser and sometimes from OS to OS

* Konqueror (Ubuntu)- allocates 2GB of memory then either crashes
  the Browser or (most often) the OS reboots. Ubuntu's memory
  management system is configured as to NOT stop the process that consumes
  too much memory, but a random process. This sometimes leads to
  processes that are vital for the OS to be killed, hence the reboot.
  I am not kidding. Thanks to 'FX' for the memory management hint.
* Chrome : allocates 2GB of memory then crashes tab with a null pointer
* Firefox : allocates 2GB of memory then the Browser crashes
* IE5,6,7,8 : allocates 2GB of memory then the Browser crashes
* Opera : Allocated and commits as much memory as available,
  will not crash but other applications will become unstable
* Nintento WII (Opera) : Console hangs, needs hard reset

  **Video:** <http://vimeo.com/2937101> (Thanks to David Raison)
* Sony PS3 - Console hangs, needs hard reset

  **Video:** <http://vimeo.com/2937101> (Thanks to Chris Gates)
* iPhone - iPhone hangs and needs hard reset

  **Video:** <http://vimeo.com/2873339> (Thanks to g0tcha)
* Aigo P8860 (Browser hangs and cannot be restarted)

#### IV. Proof of concept

<script>

function poc(o) {

e = document.createElement("select");

e.length=2147483647;

}

function go() {

poc(0);

}

</script>

URL: http://www.crashthisthing.com/select.html

Some have not understood what this code does, it does NOT loop as some vendors
claimed, it just calls select.lenght() ONCE with a huge integer. One might wonder
if over the 9 last years that this bug existed, nobody ever entered a large
number in a select.lenght() call.

#### V. Disclosure timeline

Nothing particular to note.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

The POC just triggers a JavaScript syntax error for me. You can't have a variable called "this".

I don't think the POC runs in my debug Firefox 3.0.4pre build.
In a Firefox 2.0.0.18pre debug build I get an alert and then it locks up, eating lots of memory. Didn't die though, and when I woke up the build was responsive again (though my machine had pretty much no free memory) and I was able to exit cleanly.
Both were on Mac, both were debug. My machine has 4Gb memory so maybe it's an OOM problem that shows up with less memory. I'll try on a windows machine, and on an optimized build.

My test machine : 2GB RAM, Windows,NO DEP, NX bit disabled.
Ôn a 4bg machine the time required might be longer.
@Daniel - Does run in 3.0.3, maybe wait longer until it east up enough memory.
Summary:
On my test machine, it locks up after eating around 1800mb-1900mb of total (VM) memory, then triggers access violation error in xul!NS\_NewLocalFile\_P
I have not investigated further as I hoped you will catch the error in the source (look for casting error as 0x7fffff is typical signed<->unsigned error)
Can somebody point to the code here ?

It sounds like your testcase uses up as much memory as it can and then tests the OOM handling of everything it touches. So it's hard to point to the code involved.
If you are using a Firefox release or nightly build, you can find the crashing code using Breakpad (see [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=460713#c3 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FIX]Memory exhaustion setting HTMLSelect.length() [GSEC-TZO-26-2009]")). If you are using your own build, you can use your favorite debugger. It's hard to debug release/nightly builds locally because they ship with most symbols stripped.
NS\_NewLocalFile\_P+0xddb sounds unlikely. <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/xpcom/glue/standalone/nsXPCOMGlue.cpp#195> is a small function. Most likely, that's just the closest function that happened to have its symbol left in.

Thanks Jesse, please note that WinDBG reports the second chance exception at that function (relying on exports not symbols)

It sounds like your testcase uses up as much memory as it can and then tests
the OOM handling of everything it touches.
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
The testcase just calls select.lenght ONCE with the integer refered above, it's not the testcases that consumes memory, it's the function. To be more clear if I call select.lenght with 0xffffffff nothing happens, the bug only is triggered by the value 0x7ffffff, which makes me think of a casting error.
->It may not be the cause of the bug but the very last thing that breaks.
The cause should be the select.lenght implementation.
I will reproduce on another Workstation to make sure it always reproducable.

Dear Jesse,
Just reproduced it on a clean machine, Software DEP (SEH), 3GB Ram
and made a video, the video is made using screen2exe, you can trust the exe it displays video.
Attach a debugger to catch the access violations, KiUserExceptionDispatcher is called and Software SEH catches in.

Your hint to nsHTMLSelectElement::SetLength seems to be correct, the aLenght ist being defined as an unsigned value. The value we call 0x7fffff is the MAX value for an signed integer (2147483647). In the setlenght routine referes to aLength as a signed value

bz or jst, can you look at nsHTMLSelectElement::SetLength and look for potential integer overflow spots?

Sure thing. Right here:
761 for (i = curlen; i < (PRInt32)aLength; i++) {
This is why 0xffffffff doesn't work: the loop never runs. But if you pass in PR\_INT32\_MAX (or anything smaller) we execute the loop that many times.
The thing is, technically setting HTMLSelectElement.length to an integer N is supposed (DOM0; sites rely on this) to make sure that the element has at least N options in it. Which means you have to go and create all those HTMLOptionElements. That's what this loop is doing.
I suppose we could clamp the allowed aLength values. I'd be really curious to find out what IE does here.

I can comment on IE, however please don't open this bugreport for public view until they fixed the problem (if they plan too - i'll keep you updated).
IE6 goes in some sort of endless loop, but doesn't allocated x+n amount of memory
IE7 same
IE8 doesn't care

That doesn't really answer the question, though. How does what IE does for N == 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc behave? That includes IE8. I don't mean just the CPU/memory behavior, but what does the DOM and display look like?

Forgot to update what I wrote in [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=460713#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FIX]Memory exhaustion setting HTMLSelect.length() [GSEC-TZO-26-2009]"). On an optimized Windows 3.0.4pre build I get the alert and then a crash, but the crash reporter fails (the .dmp file is 0 bytes). I run with DEP turned on, but it didn't detect the problem: it was a regular firefox crash that triggered the crash reporter (regular except for not being able to save the crash data).
On a debug windows build it doesn't seem to crash.

I was mostly asking Jesse, to be honest. Or Martijn.
In any case, we can certainly confirm this. I'm not sure it's a security issue per se, other than as a simple way to cause OOM.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: true

imho, it's more then OOM, the memory is corrupted (see access violation) they are reproducable on 2GB and 3GB machine and trigger at exactly the same function at exactly the same moment. On the 3GB machine it doesn't take 3gb to be filled but triggers exactly at the same moment. The absence of crash data also leads to think memory is corrupted.
I have not investigated whether you can control the flow in one way or another at all.

Addendum:
You are correct : The thread exits with the error not enough memory. Thats Access violation result in EDI being 0000000 and memory cannot be read.
PS.
Same for Chrome, Safari, IE5,6,7,8

Right; there's really only one place here where we're allocating memory in the loop, so the OOM will always happen at that spot with this testcase. Specifically, the CloneNode() call here.

Nothing's going to get patched until we sort out the correct behavior here...
Which is particularly fun given the no-fail allocator stuff. Ideal behavior here in some sense would be to go ahead and allocate nodes until we OOM, then back out, kill off the nodes we allocated, and return error to script. That takes a long time, though, so can be used as a DOS attack. And the no-fail allocator doesn't really allow this approach.
Which means we need to limit the range of allowed values for aLength, and then the question is what we can limit it to without breaking pages. Here the ideal thing to do would be to raise the issue in whatwg, but we don't want to take this public.... <sigh>.

Is it really that hard to come up with a cap value? A select is for users to choose things, right? How many choices can you have before the control is completely unusable? take that, multiply by 10 and you're still nowhere near 2G items.
32K? 64K? 100K?
If this is non-exploitable resource exhaustion it should be OK to talk about in whatwg. Does the official W3 HTML5 group have a private members-only mailing list like most W3 working groups?

> A select is for users to choose things, right?
You'd think... But some sites use hidden selects to store info...
> How many choices can you have before the control is completely unusable?
Depends on whether it's a listbox that has display:none on some options (the ones filtered out by some filter the page has). Sites \_definitely\_ do this.

I \_think\_ it's non-exploitable in Gecko. I can't make such a guarantee for IE and so forth...

You can contact secure@microsoft.com, security@google.com , product-security@apple.com and refer to the submissions of thierry@zoller.lu
maybe you'll find a common value.
Afaik this is a Denial of service condition only, so if you keep it low key why not ask a general question at whatwg ?

For what it's worth, I did check with Ian, and he thinks this isn't something to be specced and that we should just pick an arbitrary value (assuming we don't want to do the "try to keep allocating till it fails" approach).

This was fixed in Firefox 3.0.5 and Firefox 2.0.0.19.
I'm not sure if there was an official advisory issued. Brandon?

Dear All,
I have an additional comment to make. According to the W3C specs, the select.length attribute is READ only. If you think of it it makes sense. However every browser I know of implemented this read/write. I am wondering whether it makes sense to change that.
What use has a write ? Why should you be able to at all? Is there a legitimate use ? The only use I see, is to set it to NULL. But couldn't you just use select.remove() for that ?
Would appreciate any comments

FYI, found this comment from 2001, explaining it would break a lot of sites.
