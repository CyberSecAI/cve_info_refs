Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2009-2093:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The WebSphere Partner Gateway (WPG) console has a vulnerability that allows for SQL injection through its user interface when interacting with Oracle or DB2 databases. Specifically, the console is not properly sanitizing user-supplied input, allowing malicious SQL queries to be constructed and executed against the database.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize or properly validate user input before including it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The console likely constructs SQL queries using string concatenation or similar methods that do not properly escape or parameterize user-provided values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Integrity Compromise:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to alter or delete data stored in the database.
*   **Potential Data Breach:** The attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the WebSphere Partner Gateway console's user interface, where an attacker can manipulate input fields (such as forms or URL parameters) to insert malicious SQL code.
*   **Authentication Required:** It is likely that the attacker needs to have some form of access to the console (user credentials) to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to WebSphere Partner Gateway Console:** The attacker needs access to the WPG console. This could be through compromised credentials, internal network access, or any exposed publicly facing console.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft malicious payloads.
*   **Vulnerable version:** The attacker must target an affected version of WPG.

**Affected Versions:**
*   WebSphere Partner Gateway Enterprise Edition: 6.0, 6.0.0.1, 6.0.0.2, 6.0.0.3, 6.0.0.4, 6.0.0.5, 6.0.0.6, 6.0.0.7, 6.1, 6.1.0.1, 6.1.0.2, 6.1.1, 6.1.1.1, 6.2
*  WebSphere Partner Gateway Advanced Edition: 6.0.0, 6.0.0.1, 6.0.0.2, 6.0.0.3, 6.0.0.4, 6.0.0.5, 6.0.0.6, 6.0.0.7, 6.1.0, 6.1.0.1, 6.1.0.2, 6.1.1, 6.1.1.1, 6.2.0

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects both Oracle and DB2 databases.
*   A fix was recommended by IBM to address the vulnerability.
