{
  "CVE-2009-2695": {
    "Description": "It was discovered that SELinux did not fully implement the mmap_min_addr restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to allocate the NULL memory page which could lead to further attacks against kernel NULL-dereference vulnerabilities.",
    "Root cause": "SELinux policy did not properly enforce mmap_min_addr restrictions, allowing the mapping of the NULL page even when it should have been restricted.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete implementation of mmap_min_addr restrictions in SELinux.",
          "The unconfined_t domain in SELinux, intended for unprivileged users, bypasses the mmap_min_addr restrictions due to a policy flaw."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker can map the NULL page and potentially exploit other kernel NULL-dereference vulnerabilities, leading to privilege escalation or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system is required to perform this attack.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user account on a system with SELinux enforcing mode. No root privileges are required initially, but it could aid in exploitation by the user obtaining more privileges.",
        "Additional details": "The vulnerability can be exploited by any local user belonging to the unconfined_t domain, by mapping a zero page and triggering a null pointer dereference."
