## Thoughts on Linux

  [![Share](https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/btn_sharethis.gif?v=18499 "Share")](https://www.livejournal.com/update.bml?repost_type=c&repost=https://eparis.livejournal.com/606.html&nodraft=1) [![Flag](https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/button-flag.gif?v=17312 "Flag")](https://www.livejournal.com/tools/content_flag.bml?user=eparis&itemid=606) [![Next Entry](https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/btn_next.gif?v=17312 "Next Entry")](https://eparis.livejournal.com/891.html)mmap\_min\_addr on SELinux and non-SELinux systems[![](https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080&v=813)](https://eparis.livejournal.com/profile/)[**eparis**](https://eparis.livejournal.com/)July 21st, 2009There has been a lot of conversation about the difference in how the mmap\_min\_addr proteciton is applied on SELinux vs. non-SELinux systems and how these differences made it easier to exploit a recent kernel BUG on SELinux systems.  A number of people have claimed the SELinux made the system weaker.  It did, but in other ways it was still stronger.  I'm working to get the best of both worlds, but it isn't fair to claim a universal across the board weakening.

We, the SELinux team, made a decision to not require CAP\_SYS\_RAWIO (non techies can think of this as root, or uid=0) for mapping the 0 page.  Instead we have an SELinux policy specific permission for this operation, mmap\_zero. We made the choice to not require one to be root because WINE needs to do this operation and (sadly) there are a number of users out there who run windows applications inside WINE.

Recently a kernel exploit was posted which works by mapping the 0 page, putting crafty info on that page, tickling a bug in the kernel, and winning (It is brilliant, as usual from Brad.)   To get that 0 page mapped on a non-SELinux system he had to find a busted suid application (he found pulseaudio) and get that to map the page for him.  Since SELinux systems don't require root, he didn't need to find a busted suid application, he just had to map the 0 page and tickle the kernel bug.

Now the claim comes out that SELinux systems are less secure than non-SELinux systems.  It's true, SELinux systems are weaker against authenticated logged in local users in this case.  But it's stronger against remote attacks.  What?  Yes, I agree completely that I need to strengthen the system against attacks from a malicious local user, but we do a much better job in this case if an attacker was trying to attack remotely.

On a non-SELinux system if the attacker was able to subvert any network facing daemon they won.  They just tickled do the same thing.  Take over daemon remotely, use pulseaudio to map the page, tickle the kernel bug, win.  But what happens on an SELinux system?  It doesn't work!  Take over the network facing daemon, try the pulseaudio trick, crap, didn't get the page.  Try to map the zero page directly.  Crap it didn't work.  Now what?  You win, they lose.  SELinux is stronger than non-SELinux.

This is because SELinux confines network facing daemons and doesn't give them permissions to map the 0 page.  It's not about root or non-root.  It's not about suid or non-suid.  It's about the SELinux domain not allowing the daemon to map the 0 page.  Yes, as an unconfined user you can map the page (and I'm looking at ways to fix that) but if your system is subverted remotely, you are likely much better protected with SELinux than without.

### Response from the exploit author

[![](https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080&v=813)](https://eparis.livejournal.com/profile/)[**eparis**](https://eparis.livejournal.com/) [2009-07-23 05:53 pm (UTC)](https://eparis.livejournal.com/606.html?thread=606#t606)  These are not my comments, they are the comments of Brad Spengler, the author of the really cool exploit I mentioned. He commented off of the blog, but gave permission to post his comments here.

First off, of all people/companies, Red Hat surely knows that stolen SSH credentials or guessed passwords isn't an esoteric entry vector.

NX+ASLR by itself is enough to deter someone from trying to inject a kernel exploit like this one within a network-facing process. The thing that does the most to keep a process compromised by memory corruption bugs from doing things it shouldn't is the SELinux feature a 3rd party developed, execmod -- basically PaX's MPROTECT feature (remember when Ingo argued against it?)

Second, it's a little disingenuous to try to prop up the security of SELinux by bringing up the Wine issue. How many webservers do you know of that run X and Wine? The real entry vector here is webservers (say with some vulnerable php / SQL injection bug) or other multi-user machines, not desktops where people would be running Wine (as a multi-user desktop with Wine would almost certainly involve some sort of physical access as well).

So in the cases where the exploit would have been actually used, by default, SELinux removed security that would have existed had SELinux been disabled.

And from reading Dan Walsh's blog, it looks as though the problem is quite a bit larger and won't be remedied fully anytime soon because
1) There still hasn't been a CVE for it yet, which demonstrates from Red Hat's end that this isn't important to them
2) Dan Walsh gave the command for all exploit writers to use to be able to mmap at 0 even if unconfined\_t isn't allowed to do it in the future
3) He's also said that RHEL5 by default will continue to allow unconfined\_t to mmap at 0 for compatability purposes.

Though I believe based on the current patch submitted to LKML, 2&3 will only apply when mmap\_min\_addr is disabled (though then the compatability argument doesn't make much sense, as users may be expecting to be able to mmap there (since they've been able to for who knows how long -- I haven't seen anyone from Fedora or Red Hat quantify this yet) and with the new kernel they'll be unable to without disabling mmap\_min\_addr).

## Details

Solar Designer discovered that the z90crypt driver did not correctly

check capabilities. A local attacker could exploit this to shut down

the device, leading to a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06.

([CVE-2009-1883](/security/CVE-2009-1883))

Michael Buesch discovered that the SGI GRU driver did not correctly check

the length when setting options. A local attacker could exploit this

to write to the kernel stack, leading to root privilege escalation or

a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2584](/security/CVE-2009-2584))

It was discovered that SELinux did not fully implement the mmap\_min\_addr

restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to allocate the

NULL memory page which could lead to further attacks against kernel

NULL-dereference vulnerabilities. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected.

([CVE-2009-2695](/security/CVE-2009-2695))

Cagri Coltekin discovered that the UDP stack did not correctly handle

certain flags. A local user could send specially crafted commands and

traffic to gain root privileges or crash the systeam, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06. ([CVE-2009-2698](/security/CVE-2009-2698))

Hiroshi Shimamoto discovered that monotonic timers did not correctly

validate parameters. A local user could make a specially crafted timer

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2767](/security/CVE-2009-2767))

Michael Buesch discovered that the HPPA ISA EEPROM driver did not

correctly validate positions. A local user could make a specially crafted

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2846](/security/CVE-2009-2846))

Ulrich Drepper discovered that kernel signal stacks were not being

correctly padded on 64-bit systems. A local attacker could send specially

crafted calls to expose 4 bytes of kernel stack memory, leading to a

loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-2847](/security/CVE-2009-2847))

Jens Rosenboom discovered that the clone method did not correctly clear

certain fields. A local attacker could exploit this to gain privileges

or crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-2848](/security/CVE-2009-2848))

It was discovered that the MD driver did not check certain sysfs files.

A local attacker with write access to /sys could exploit this to cause

a system crash, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 6.06 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-2849](/security/CVE-2009-2849))

Mark Smith discovered that the AppleTalk stack did not correctly

manage memory. A remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic

to cause the system to consume all available memory, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2903](/security/CVE-2009-2903))

Loïc Minier discovered that eCryptfs did not correctly handle writing

to certain deleted files. A local attacker could exploit this to gain

root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-2908](/security/CVE-2009-2908))

It was discovered that the LLC, AppleTalk, IR, EConet, Netrom, and

ROSE network stacks did not correctly initialize their data structures.

A local attacker could make specially crafted calls to read kernel memory,

leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3001](/security/CVE-2009-3001), [CVE-2009-3002](/security/CVE-2009-3002))

It was discovered that the randomization used for Address Space Layout

Randomization was predictable within a small window of time. A local

attacker could exploit this to leverage further attacks that require

knowledge of userspace memory layouts. ([CVE-2009-3238](/security/CVE-2009-3238))

Eric Paris discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly handle file creation

failures. An attacker with write access to an NFSv4 share could exploit

this to create files with arbitrary mode bits, leading to privilege

escalation or a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3286](/security/CVE-2009-3286))

Bob Tracy discovered that the SCSI generic driver did not correctly use

the right index for array access. A local attacker with write access

to a CDR could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 9.04 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3288](/security/CVE-2009-3288))

Jan Kiszka discovered that KVM did not correctly validate certain

hypercalls. A local unprivileged attacker in a virtual guest could exploit

this to crash the guest kernel, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu

6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3290](/security/CVE-2009-3290))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2009:1540 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2009-11-03
Updated:
2009-11-03
# RHSA-2009:1540 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix several security issues, multiple bugs,
and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.1.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* the ADDR\_COMPAT\_LAYOUT and MMAP\_PAGE\_ZERO flags were not cleared when a

setuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to bypass the mmap\_min\_addr protection mechanism and perform a
NULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)

* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local

users in the unconfined\_t domain to map low memory areas even if the
mmap\_min\_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local
exploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in getname() implementations in

numerous network protocol implementations in the Linux kernel. Certain
data structures in these getname() implementations were not initialized
properly before being copied to user-space. These flaws could lead to an
information leak. (CVE-2009-3002, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux

kernel. pci\_unmap\_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
abuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.
(CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the r128 driver in the

Linux kernel. Checks to test if the Concurrent Command Engine state was
initialized were missing in private IOCTL functions. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a local denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2009-3620, Important)

* Kees Cook and Steve Beattie discovered a race condition in the /proc

code in the Linux kernel. This could lead to information in the
"/proc/[pid]/maps" and "/proc/[pid]/smaps" files being leaked to users (who
would otherwise not have access to this information) during ELF loading.
This could help a local attacker bypass the ASLR security feature.
(CVE-2009-2691, Moderate)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the md driver in the Linux

kernel. If the suspend\_lo or suspend\_hi file in "/sys/" is modified when
the disk array is inactive, it could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. By default, only root can write to these two files.
(CVE-2009-2849, Moderate)

* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,

32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. (CVE-2009-2910, Moderate)

* padding data in several core network structures was not initialized

properly before being sent to user-space, possibly leading to information
leaks. (CVE-2009-3228, CVE-2009-3612, Moderate)

* the unix\_stream\_connect() function in the Linux kernel did not check if a

UNIX domain socket was in the shutdown state. This could lead to a
deadlock. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2009-3621, Moderate)

These updated packages also include bug fixes and enhancements. Users are
directed to the Realtime Security Update Release Notes for version 1.1 for
information on these changes, which will be available shortly from:

<http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_MRG/>

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues and add enhancements. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=517830#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-17 12:28:34 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Dan Walsh's blog post mentioned in the previous comment details selinux-policy part of the issue tracked via [bug #512284](show_bug.cgi?id=512284 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2009-1897 kernel: tun/tap: Fix crashes if open() /dev/net/tun and then poll() it").  As noted in the the blog, selinux-policy provides a boolean - allow_unconfined_mmap_low - which controls whether mmap_min_addr restriction is applied to the process.  This boolean, however, did not work as expected, as unconfined_t domain (default domain for logged-in unprivileged users) was always permitted to map low memory pages regardless of the boolean setting.  This problem with the boolean is being fixed and the fix will be included in future selinux-policy updates in RHEL5 and Fedora (see Dan's blog for NVRs).  Few notes specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5: Support for mmap_min_addr sysctl was not included in the GA version of RHEL5.  It was only added in kernel update in 5.2 (it first appeared upstream in 2.6.24).  selinux-policy was, to avoid breaking applications needing low memory pages mapping on upgrade from 5.1 to 5.2, configured to allow mmap_zero in unconfined domains and only disallow it in confined domains (e.g. various network facing services).  In 5.3, allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean was added, but it's default value for targeted policy was changed to on, i.e. allowing mmap_zero in all unconfined domains by default.  This default boolean value is planned to remain unchanged in 5.4.  It should also be noted, that even with allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean set to off, it is still possible for unconfined_t user to transition to other domain that is permitted to mmap_zero, as details in the Dan's blog post.  Upstream discussion on how to best address this issue is still ongoing.  Eric's proposed patches moving mmap_min_addr check out of security were submitted.  If they are accepted upstream, mmap_min_addr will be checked before LSM hooks are called.  Security modules will only be consulted if mmap_min_addr check has passed (e.g. when mmap_min_addr is 0), so SELinux may still be able to restrict mapping of the low pages / zero page for confined domains and permit mapping in unconfined, even when mmap_min_addr is 0.  Eric's patches with further discussion: <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36540/> <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36539/>  Updated version: <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36650/> <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36649/>  Further discussion of the proposed change: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.lsm/9075>  mmap_min_addr on SELinux and non-SELinux systems <http://eparis.livejournal.com/606.html>  Confining the unconfined. Oxymoron? <http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/30084.html>  Kbase: <http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-18042>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=517830#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2009-08-17 15:33:10 UTC  ``` CVE-2009-2695: A system with SELinux enabled with the default targeted policy is more permissive for unconfined domains, allowing local users to map low memory areas even if mmap_min_addr protection is enabled.  This could allow the exploitation of NULL pointer dereference flaws.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=517830#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-19 05:52:00 UTC  ``` Upstream commits: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/9c0d90103c7e0eb6e638e5b649e9f6d8d9c1b4b3> <http://git.kernel.org/linus/8cf948e744e0218af604c32edecde10006dc8e9e> <http://git.kernel.org/linus/788084aba2ab7348257597496befcbccabdc98a3> <http://git.kernel.org/linus/1d9959734a1949ea4f2427bd2d8b21ede6b2441c>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=517830#c11)  Fedora Update System    2009-08-27 02:19:16 UTC  ``` kernel-2.6.29.6-217.2.16.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=517830#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-17 12:28:34 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Dan Walsh's blog post mentioned in the previous comment details selinux-policy part of the issue tracked via [bug #512284](show_bug.cgi?id=512284 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2009-1897 kernel: tun/tap: Fix crashes if open() /dev/net/tun and then poll() it").  As noted in the the blog, selinux-policy provides a boolean - allow_unconfined_mmap_low - which controls whether mmap_min_addr restriction is applied to the process.  This boolean, however, did not work as expected, as unconfined_t domain (default domain for logged-in unprivileged users) was always permitted to map low memory pages regardless of the boolean setting.  This problem with the boolean is being fixed and the fix will be included in future selinux-policy updates in RHEL5 and Fedora (see Dan's blog for NVRs).  Few notes specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5: Support for mmap_min_addr sysctl was not included in the GA version of RHEL5.  It was only added in kernel update in 5.2 (it first appeared upstream in 2.6.24).  selinux-policy was, to avoid breaking applications needing low memory pages mapping on upgrade from 5.1 to 5.2, configured to allow mmap_zero in unconfined domains and only disallow it in confined domains (e.g. various network facing services).  In 5.3, allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean was added, but it's default value for targeted policy was changed to on, i.e. allowing mmap_zero in all unconfined domains by default.  This default boolean value is planned to remain unchanged in 5.4.  It should also be noted, that even with allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean set to off, it is still possible for unconfined_t user to transition to other domain that is permitted to mmap_zero, as details in the Dan's blog post.  Upstream discussion on how to best address this issue is still ongoing.  Eric's proposed patches moving mmap_min_addr check out of security were submitted.  If they are accepted upstream, mmap_min_addr will be checked before LSM hooks are called.  Security modules will only be consulted if mmap_min_addr check has passed (e.g. when mmap_min_addr is 0), so SELinux may still be able to restrict mapping of the low pages / zero page for confined domains and permit mapping in unconfined, even when mmap_min_addr is 0.

Cox    2009-08-17 15:33:10 UTC  ``` CVE-2009-2695: A system with SELinux enabled with the default targeted policy is more permissive for unconfined domains, allowing local users to map low memory areas even if mmap_min_addr protection is enabled.

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local

users in the unconfined\_t domain to map low memory areas even if the
mmap\_min\_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local
exploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the eCryptfs implementation

in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a local
denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2908, Important)

* a flaw was found in the NFSv4 implementation. The kernel would do an

unnecessary permission check after creating a file. This check would
usually fail and leave the file with the permission bits set to random
values. Note: This is a server-side only issue. (CVE-2009-3286, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux

kernel. pci\_unmap\_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
abuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.
(CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in the Linux kernel. Padding data

in several core network structures was not initialized properly before
being sent to user-space. These flaws could lead to information leaks.
(CVE-2009-3228, Moderate)

Bug fixes:

* with network bonding in the "balance-tlb" or "balance-alb" mode, the

primary setting for the primary slave device was lost when said device was
brought down. Bringing the slave back up did not restore the primary
setting. (BZ#517971)

* some faulty serial device hardware caused systems running the kernel-xen

kernel to take a very long time to boot. (BZ#524153)

* a caching bug in nfs\_readdir() may have caused NFS clients to see

duplicate files or not see all files in a directory. (BZ#526960)

* the RHSA-2009:1243 update removed the mpt\_msi\_enable option, preventing

certain scripts from running. This update adds the option back. (BZ#526963)

* an iptables rule with the recent module and a hit count value greater

than the ip\_pkt\_list\_tot parameter (the default is 20), did not have any
effect over packets, as the hit count could not be reached. (BZ#527434)

* a check has been added to the IPv4 code to make sure that rt is not NULL,

to help prevent future bugs in functions that call ip\_append\_data() from
being exploitable. (BZ#527436)

* a kernel panic occurred in certain conditions after reconfiguring a tape

drive's block size. (BZ#528133)

* when using the Linux Virtual Server (LVS) in a master and backup

configuration, and propagating active connections on the master to the
backup, the connection timeout value on the backup was hard-coded to 180
seconds, meaning connection information on the backup was soon lost. This
could prevent the successful failover of connections. The timeout value
can now be set via "ipvsadm --set". (BZ#528645)

* a bug in nfs4\_do\_open\_expired() could have caused the reclaimer thread on

an NFSv4 client to enter an infinite loop. (BZ#529162)

* MSI interrupts may not have been delivered for r8169 based network cards

that have MSI interrupts enabled. This bug only affected certain systems.
(BZ#529366)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

| [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=511143#c1)  Daniel Walsh    2009-07-13 21:19:55 UTC  ``` I have a fix for this in selinux-policy-2.4.6-252.el5   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=511143#c10)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-07-17 10:53:30 UTC  ``` The default SELinux policy allows processes in the unconfined domains to map low memory in the kernel. We are updating the selinux-policy package to allow the user to set the allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean, and to prevent unconfined_t from being able to map low memory in the kernel. No Relabel or Reboot required.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=511143#c14)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-07-22 06:38:38 UTC  ``` mmap_min_addr on SELinux and non-SELinux systems <http://eparis.livejournal.com/606.html>  Confining the unconfined. Oxymoron? <http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/30084.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=511143#c15)  Tomas Hoger    2009-07-22 08:07:08 UTC  ``` Dan Walsh's blog post mentioned in the previous comment details selinux-policy part of the issue tracked via [bug #512284](show_bug.cgi?id=512284 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2009-1897 kernel: tun/tap: Fix crashes if open() /dev/net/tun and then poll() it").  As noted in the the blog, selinux-policy provides a boolean - allow_unconfined_mmap_low - which controls whether mmap_min_addr restriction is applied to the process.  This boolean, however, did not work as expected, as unconfined_t domain (default domain for logged-in unprivileged users) was always permitted to map low memory pages regardless of the boolean setting.  This problem with the boolean is being fixed and the fix will be included in future selinux-policy updates in RHEL5 and Fedora (see Dan's blog for NVRs).  Few notes specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5: Support for mmap_min_addr sysctl was not included in the GA version of RHEL5.  It was only added in kernel update in 5.2 (it first appeared upstream in 2.6.24).  selinux-policy was, to avoid breaking applications needing low memory pages mapping on upgrade from 5.1 to 5.2, configured to allow mmap_zero in unconfined domains and only disallow it in confined domains (e.g. various network facing services).  In 5.3, allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean was added, but it's default value for targeted policy was changed to on, i.e. allowing mmap_zero in all unconfined domains by default.  This default boolean value is planned to remain unchanged in 5.4.  It should also be noted, that even with allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean set to off, it is still possible for unconfined_t user to transition to other domain that is permitted to mmap_zero, as details in the Dan's blog post.  Upstream discussion on how to best address this issue is still ongoing.  Eric's proposed patches moving mmap_min_addr check out of security were submitted.  If they are accepted upstream, mmap_min_addr will be checked before LSM hooks are called.  Security modules will only be consulted if mmap_min_addr check has passed (e.g. when mmap_min_addr is 0), so SELinux may still be able to restrict mapping of the low pages / zero page for confined domains and permit mapping in unconfined, even when mmap_min_addr is 0.  Eric's patches with further discussion: <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36540/> <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36539/>  Updated version: <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36650/> <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36649/>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=511143#c16)  Tomas Hoger    2009-07-22 09:15:35 UTC  ``` Further discussion of the proposed change: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.lsm/9075>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=511143#c20)  Tomas Hoger    2009-08-25 09:37:48 UTC  ``` Related knowledge base article:   <http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-18042>  Bug tracking addition of Eric's changes to perform mmap_min_addr as root-based check instead of SELinux policy only based check - [bug #517830](show_bug.cgi?id=517830 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-2695 kernel: SELinux and mmap_min_addr").   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=511143#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-09-02 07:58:15 UTC  ``` An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

### Got SELinux?

[![Previous Entry](https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/btn_prev.gif?v=17312 "Previous Entry")](https://danwalsh.livejournal.com/29790.html)  [![Share](https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/btn_sharethis.gif?v=18499 "Share")](https://www.livejournal.com/update.bml?repost_type=c&repost=https://danwalsh.livejournal.com/30084.html&nodraft=1) [![Flag](https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/button-flag.gif?v=17312 "Flag")](https://www.livejournal.com/tools/content_flag.bml?user=danwalsh&itemid=30084) [![Next Entry](https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/btn_next.gif?v=17312 "Next Entry")](https://danwalsh.livejournal.com/30335.html)Confining the unconfined. Oxymoron?![](https://l-userpic.livejournal.com/61868732/9465280)[![](https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080&v=813)](https://danwalsh.livejournal.com/profile/)[**danwalsh**](https://danwalsh.livejournal.com/)July 21st, 2009When we first designed targeted policy, we defined a domain that allowed users and administrators to login and have the same access privileges they would have had if SELinux was disabled.  Similarly, we wanted to allow third party applications to be installed and run without requiring the administrator/user to write special policy rules for these applications.   They would just work.

We designed the unconfined domain for this.

The unconfined domain originally was written as a rule like

allow UNCONFINED\_DOMAIN \*:\* \*;

meaning processes running as the unconfined\_domain are allowed to do everything SELinux can deny.  Unconfined domains are thus an exception to the way an SELinux system is usually written.

Over time we have had requests to add exceptions to the "unconfined can do anything" rule.

We confine the unconfined domain in a  couple of different ways.

One way to confine an unconfined domain is via process transitions.  We can write rules to specify that an unconfined\_domain will transition into a different, confined, domain when it executes a program with a certain label.

On most targeted systems, the init scripts run as initrc\_t, an unconfined domain.  When an init script executes a file labeled httpd\_exec\_t, the process transitions to the httpd\_t domain, a confined domain.  Another process that transitions from an unconfined domain to a confined one is the unconfined\_t domain, the domain used by unconfined users.   For example, when the unconfined user tries to set up a vpn connection using vpnc, the vpnc program transitions to vpnc\_t, a confined domain. Currently in Rawhide, I count around 50 transitions from the unconfined\_t domain to other domains.

# sesearch --allow -s unconfined\_t -c process -p transition | wc -l
     50

A second way to confine the unconfined domains is to wrap specific allow rules within a boolean.

We have changed the line

allow UNCONFINED\_DOMAIN \*:\* \*;

to something like

    # Use any Linux capability.
    allow $1 self:capability all\_capabilities;
    allow $1 self:fifo\_file manage\_fifo\_file\_perms;
    # Userland object managers
    allow $1 self:nscd all\_nscd\_perms;
    allow $1 self:dbus all\_dbus\_perms;
    allow $1 self:passwd all\_passwd\_perms;
    allow $1 self:association all\_association\_perms;

....
    allow $1  self:process ~{ transition dyntransition execmem execstack execheap };

    tunable\_policy(`allow\_execheap',`
        # Allow making the stack executable via mprotect.
        allow $1 self:process execheap;
    ')

    tunable\_policy(`allow\_execmem',`
        # Allow making anonymous memory executable, e.g.
        # for runtime-code generation or executable stack.
        allow $1 self:process execmem;
    ')

...

Wrapping the access within booleans gives the administrator the ability to decide whether or not to add limited confinement to the unconfined domains.

For example, we restrict the unconfined users from executing memory that is both writable and executable at the same time.  This access can be tuned using these booleans: allow\_execheap, allow\_execmem, allow\_execstack, allow\_execmod.

Denying this access allows us to stop a lot of buffer overflows from being exploited.  If a user downloads content that can cause applications like acroread or evince to overflow a buffer, these checks will prevent the execution of code in corrupted memory, protecting the user.  Since the permission checks prevent the execution of random code, they help secure the system.

I would like to point out that these checks are trying to protect a user who is not trying to crack the system from being cracked.  These checks do nothing to prevent a cracker currently running as unconfined\_t from attacking the system.

Periodically we have added checks to try to harden the machine against broken or malicious applications running as unconfined\_t from attacking the machine.  Most of these preventions are the equivalent of putting a garden fence around the prison,  i.e. they are easily gotten around.   If a cracker gets into an SELinux box as unconfined\_t, SELinux will prevent him from doing very little, since that is how unconfined\_t is designed.  It is up to DAC to protect the system.

Last week, Brad Spengler  revealed a vulnerability that allowed him to gain control of the kernel and in doing so is able to disable all security mechanisms including those of LSMs like SELinux.  this is a whole new vulnerability, although it is in the same class of bugs as one he reported a couple of years back, and in that case he was also able to turn off SELinux policy enforcement.  The mmap\_zero check was added to the kernel to control whether or not applications would be allowed to map memory at the zero address.  A decision was made to treat this differently on systems with or without SELinux enabled.  On systems without SELinux, applications have to run as root or you need to disable the check on the entire system.   On systems with SELinux enabled, this is decided by policy, and whether you are root or not is ignored.  One application that requires mmap\_zero is wine. If you want to run wine apps on an SELinux disabled machine, you need to disable this check, for the entire system.  To run wine as a non-root user you need to
lessen the security of every single program on the machine.  On a machine with SELinux enabled you can run wine as normal user, and still have the protection where all confined domains, even those running as root, can not subvirt the machine.  The only confined applications that have the mmap\_zero privilege in RHEL5 are vbetool, xdm, xserver and wine.  In rawhide,  only wine and vbetool have the privilege.  All unconfined domains have a boolean, allow\_unconfined\_mmap\_zero, wrapping the mmap\_zero privilege.  In RHEL5 the boolean is enabled by default for backwards compatibilitally, as mmap\_min\_addr was introduced during the lifetime of RHEL5, allowing all unconfined domains to mmap\_zero.  By default in Fedora 10, 11 and rawhide, the boolean is disabled, denying all unconfined domains the mmap\_zero access.  We are not planning on changing the default in RHEL5, to maintain backawards compatability.

You can toggle the boolean off by executing

# setsebool -P allow\_unconfined\_mmap\_low=0

Note:
    There was a bug in policy in both Fedora and RHEL5 where unconfined\_t, ignored the boolean.  This means unconfined\_t could mmap\_zero, whether or not the boolean was turned on. We have decided to change the unconfined\_t domain to follow the boolean in updates. Versions: selinux-policy-3.5.13-66.fc10, selinux-policy-3.6.12-66.fc11, selinux-policy-3.6.22-1.fc12.noarch, selinux-policy-2.4.6-253.el5, have the fix.

Brad figured out that unconfined\_t domain ignores the boolean and is always allowed to mmap\_zero.  The default logged in user on a targeted SELinux system has the ability to mmap\_zero.

But I question whether or not this is even worth doing.  We are putting a speed bump in front of a determined cracker.  If a cracker is logged in to a machine as the unconfined\_t user he can easily compile the executable described by Brad, change its context to vbetool\_exec\_t, and then use runcon to execute the script with the mmap\_zero privilege.

$ /usr/sbin/getsebool allow\_unconfined\_mmap\_low
allow\_unconfined\_mmap\_low --> off

So the user downloads the cracker.

$ ./cracker
mmap: Permission denied

SELinux is working, but the unconfined\_t user can label his cracker app as vbetool\_exec\_t, (a tool that needs mmap\_zero).

chcon -t vbetool\_exec\_t ./cracker

$ ./cracker
mmap: Permission denied

Notice that it still blew up.  This is because it does not transition from unconfined\_t to vbetool\_t, automatically.

But how about.

$ runcon -t initrc\_t -- sh -c ./a.out
got a NULL mapping...

This succeeds because, there is a transition defined from unconfined\_t to initrc\_t, and also a transition from initrc\_t to vbetool\_t.

In conclusion, this shows that the boolean preventing the unconfined\_t domain or any other unconfined domains from performing mmap\_zero is pretty useless in preventing a cracker from attacking the system.
If you use unconfined\_t users and a cracker gets to login as one, SELinux can not prevent mmap\_zero.
A cracker running as unconfined\_t, can use just about any root exploit, just as if SELinux was disabled.

In the future we need to better understand what it means to try to confine the unconfined user.

### should runcon/chcon be priviledged commands ?

[![](https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/social-icons/colored/openid.svg?v=5044&v=813)](https://www.livejournal.com/profile/?userid=21657645&t=I)[**ext\_204143**](https://ext-204143.livejournal.com/) [2009-08-18 05:52 pm (UTC)](https://danwalsh.livejournal.com/30084.html?thread=208516#t208516)  I'm a bit surprised that an unconfined normal user is allower to use runcon/chcon this way. I would expect these to be priviledged commands only available to root.. Shouldn't they be?

The kernel is responsible for checking whether on not a type is able to change the context from one context to another.

Similary, the kernel/policy will control whether one process can transition to another process.

From an SELinux point of view running as UID=0 means NOTHING. There is no concept of Privledged in the DAC sense.

I've never had a use for letting non-admins modify these labels, and always assumed they were managed by the central file\_context policy..

So a user\_t user might be allowed to relabelfrom user\_home\_t to httpd\_user\_content\_t to allow them to make content available to apache from within their home dir.

This is very different then the way traditional MLS machines worked. So they are not changing the sensitivity level of data, they are just labeling data from one type they control to another.

### unconfined == root?

[![](https://l-stat.livejournal.net/img/userinfo_v8.svg?v=17080&v=813)](https://cmccabe.livejournal.com/profile/)[**cmccabe**](https://cmccabe.livejournal.com/) [2009-09-09 08:12 am (UTC)](https://danwalsh.livejournal.com/30084.html?thread=211844#t211844)  If I understand you correctly, the unconfined user can always relabel his apps into whatever domain is convenient for him. So in essence he has the capabilities of all of them. So we arrive back at the idea of the all-powerful root, aka the guy who holds all the keys.

The NULL pointer exploit thing is big and flashy, but I have a hunch that there are other ways to escalate from unconfined --> root. I think you are going to have to forbid non-root users from running as "unconfined."

Anyway, in spite of all the difficulties, I'm glad you guys are working on selinux. Capability-based security is definitely an idea whose time has come...

Message-ID: <0908171653340.25831@mjc.redhat.com>
Date: Mon, 17 Aug 2009 17:05:40 +0100 (BST)
From: Mark J Cox <mjc@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: SELinux and mmap_min_addr behaviour (CVE-2009-2695)

FYI given upstream discussions we gave CVE-2009-2695 to 'a system with
SELinux enabled with the default targeted policy is more permissive for
unconfined domains, allowing local users to map low memory areas even if
mmap_min_addr protection is enabled.  This could allow the exploitation of
NULL pointer dereference flaws'. See also <http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-18042>
