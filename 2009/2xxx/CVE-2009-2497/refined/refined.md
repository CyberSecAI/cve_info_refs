{
  "CVE-2009-2497": {
    "Root cause": "This vulnerability results from the manner in which the Microsoft .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) handles interfaces.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The Microsoft .NET Framework's Common Language Runtime (CLR) improperly handles interfaces."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a malicious Microsoft .NET application or a malicious Silverlight application to modify memory of the attacker's choice, leading to arbitrary unmanaged code execution. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the local user or the user account of ASP.NET. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Web browsing: An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site containing a malicious XBAP or Silverlight application, convincing a user to visit it.",
      "Web hosting: An attacker could upload a malicious ASP.NET application to a web hosting environment that allows custom ASP.NET applications.",
      "Microsoft .NET Framework application: An attacker could place a malicious .NET application on a network share and convince users to execute it."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious .NET or Silverlight application and convince a user to execute it through either web browsing, web hosting, or direct execution of a .NET application."
