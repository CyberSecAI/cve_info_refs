Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-2360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `sork-passwd-h3` module, a Horde3 module used for changing user passwords. Specifically, the `backend` parameter was not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw. This occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `backend` parameter, before including it in the generated HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability enables an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session when they interact with the vulnerable page.
*   **Session Hijacking/Account Compromise:** An attacker could potentially steal a user's session cookies, leading to session hijacking and the ability to impersonate the user.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could use the XSS to redirect users to malicious sites, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker could inject code to display a fake login form on the legitimate page, tricking users into entering their credentials and stealing user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `backend` parameter.
    *   Example from the bug report: `http://hordeserver.com/horde/passwd/main.php?backend=>"><!--a75c305b1c0a6022--><script>alert('XSS')</script>&userid=stevejobs&return_to=&oldpassword=foo&newpassword0=foo&newpassword1=foo&submit=Change%20Password`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to entice the victim to click on the crafted URL.
*   The attacker can also embed this crafted URL on a malicious website that is visited by the victim.
*   No special privileges are needed other than knowledge of the vulnerable parameter, as exploitation does not require any authentication by the attacker.
*   The attacker does not need to have access to the server.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was reported on July 3, 2009, and fixed on July 5, 2009, in version 3.1.1 of the `sork-passwd-h3` module.
* Debian issued a security advisory (DSA 1829-1) and updated packages for its oldstable (etch), stable (lenny) and unstable (sid) distributions to address this vulnerability
* The fix involved sanitizing the `backend` parameter to prevent injection of script.
