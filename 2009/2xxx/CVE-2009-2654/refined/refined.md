Response:
The content relates to CVE-2009-2654.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of invalid URLs during the window.open() operation. Specifically, when an invalid URL is provided, Firefox's error page is loaded. However, this error page could be manipulated through `document.write()` before the error page's content is fully loaded and displayed, leading to spoofing.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- URL spoofing: The location bar can be made to display a false URL.
- SSL indicator spoofing: The SSL indicators from the original page can be carried over to the spoofed page even if the spoofed page does not have a valid certificate.
- document.write manipulation: Malicious actors can use `document.write()` to inject arbitrary content into the spoofed page.

Impact of exploitation:
A successful exploitation could mislead users into believing they are on a legitimate website, making them vulnerable to phishing attacks. They could potentially disclose confidential information or engage in other harmful actions on the malicious page.

Attack vectors:
- A malicious web page uses the `window.open()` function with an invalid URL and manipulates the new window using `document.write()` to display fake content.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an invalid URL is loaded in a new window or tab, which causes an error page to be loaded.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to host a malicious web page accessible to the victim.
- The attacker has to craft a specific javascript that leverages `window.open()` to load an invalid URL and then perform DOM manipulation via `document.write()`.

Additional Details:
- The vulnerability affects all current versions of Firefox.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 3.0.13 and 3.5.2.
- The bug report ([https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=451898](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=451898)) contains detailed technical information about the root cause and the fix.
- The vulnerability also affects xulrunner which is fixed in version 1.9.0.13-0lenny1 for Debian stable and 1.9.0.13-1 for Debian unstable.
