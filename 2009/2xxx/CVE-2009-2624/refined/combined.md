Package: gzip
Version: 1.3.12-6
Severity: normal
Tags: patch

A specific malformed input file (cf. attachment) either leads to gzip
crashing with segmentation violation or hanging in an endless loop.

Attached patch fixes the problem.

The issue doesn't look exploitable to me, but I'm not an expert.

Kind regards,

Thiemo Nagel

thanks

Thanks for the patch Thiemo. I've verified this and have it in a git
commit ready to push out into a new package release, (assuming Bdale
reviews and approves of course). But we'll wait for lenny to release and
for unstable to unfreeze before we push it.

-Carl

Thiemo Nagel reported (to the Debian project) that a specially-crafted
file could cause gzip to segfault or hang. The file is attached below.

Also attached is a patch that addresses the problem. With this patch
attached, gzip will simply report a malformed input file and exit as
desired.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : gzip
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Ids        : CVE-2009-2624 CVE-2010-0001
Debian Bug     : 507263

Several vulnerabilities have been found in gzip, the GNU compression
utilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-2624

Thiemo Nagel discovered a missing input sanitation flaw in the way gzip
used to decompress data blocks for dynamic Huffman codes, which could
lead to the execution of arbitrary code when trying to decompress a
crafted archive. This issue is a reappearance of CVE-2006-4334 and only
affects the lenny version.

CVE-2010-0001

Aki Helin discovered an integer underflow when decompressing files that
are compressed using the LZW algorithm. This could lead to the execution
of arbitrary code when trying to decompress a crafted LZW compressed
gzip archive.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.12-6+lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.5-15+etch1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your gzip packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=514711#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-07-30 12:42:04 UTC  ``` A missing input sanitation flaw was found in the way gzip used to decompress data blocks for dynamic Huffman codes. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted gzip compressed data archive, which once opened by a local, unsuspecting user would lead to denial of service (gzip crash) or, potentially,  to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running gzip.  Upstream patch: --------------- <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gzip.git/commit/?id=39a362ae9d9b007473381dba5032f4dfc1744cf2>  CVE Note: --------- This flaw reportedly exists due to re-introduction of [CVE-2006-4334](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-4334) issue:  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4334>  in upstream gzip version (originally fixed in gzip-v1.3.6, reintroduced later in gzip-v1.3.10 and fixed again with above commit -- in gzip-v.1.3.13).  Credit: ------- Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=514711#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-07-30 13:51:46 UTC  ``` This issue does NOT affect the versions of the gzip package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.  This issue affects the versions of the gzip package, as shipped with Fedora releases of 11 and 12.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=514711#c14)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-21 19:55:58 UTC  ``` gzip-1.3.12-14.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gzip-1.3.12-14.fc12>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=514711#c15)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-21 19:59:15 UTC  ``` gzip-1.3.12-10.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/gzip-1.3.12-10.fc11>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=514711#c16)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-01 01:02:58 UTC  ``` gzip-1.3.12-14.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=514711#c17)  Fedora Update System    2010-02-01 01:03:45 UTC  ``` gzip-1.3.12-10.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=514711#c18)  Vincent Danen    2014-09-02 20:50:56 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of gzip as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, or 5.  It was corrected in the versions of gzip as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0 and later.   ``` |  |

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Specially crafted PDF files could crash acroread. Attackers could
potentially exploit that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-3953,
CVE-2009-3954, CVE-2009-3955, CVE-2009-3956, CVE-2009-3957,
CVE-2009-3958, CVE-2009-3959, CVE-2009-4324).
Acrobat reader was updated to version 9.3 to fix the security issues.
Note: Due to integration issues with the major version update of
acroread on SLE10 updates for SLE10 are not ready yet. Fixed
packages will be submitted ASAP.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of acroread after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

5) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds:
- transmission
Specially crafted torrent files could overwrite arbitrary files
(CVE-2010-0012).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libopenssl-devel
Incorrect use of an openssl cleanup function can lead to memory
leaks in applications. For example an ssl enabled web server such as
apache that uses php, curl and openssl leaks memory if a SIGHUP
signal was sent to apache. The openssl cleanup function was made
more robust to avoid memory leaks (CVE-2009-4355).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- gzip
Specially crafted gzip archives could lead to gzip allocating a too
small huffman table. Attackers could exploit that to crash gzip
(CVE-2009-2624).
Specially crafted gzip archives could trigger integer overflows.
Attackers could exploit that to crash gzip or potentially execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2010-0001). Only 64bit architectures are
affected by this flaw.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- bind
bind when configured for DNSSEC could incorrectly cache NXDOMAIN
responses (CVE-2010-0097). Moreover, the fix for CVE-2009-4022 was
incomplete. Despite the previous fix CNAME and DNAME responses could
be incorrectly cached (CVE-2010-0290).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- viewvc
viewvc was updated to version 1.1.3 which fixes the following security problems:
- add root listing support of per-root authz config (CVE-2010-0004).
- query.py requires 'forbidden' authorizer (or none) in config (CVE-2010-0005).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2

- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

## Details

It was discovered that gzip incorrectly handled certain malformed

compressed files. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a

specially crafted gzip file, an attacker could cause gzip to crash or

possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2009-2624](/security/CVE-2009-2624))

Aki Helin discovered that gzip incorrectly handled certain malformed

files compressed with the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) algorithm. If a user or

automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted gzip file,

an attacker could cause gzip to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0001](/security/CVE-2010-0001))
