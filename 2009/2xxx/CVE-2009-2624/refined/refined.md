  "CVE-2009-2624": {
    "description": "A missing input sanitation flaw was found in the way gzip used to decompress data blocks for dynamic Huffman codes. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted gzip compressed data archive, which once opened by a local, unsuspecting user would lead to denial of service (gzip crash) or, potentially,  to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running gzip.",
    "root_cause": "Missing input sanitation when decompressing data blocks with dynamic Huffman codes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Incorrect handling of malformed compressed data"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (crash) or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted gzip archive"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to create a malformed gzip file and trick a user into decompressing it."
