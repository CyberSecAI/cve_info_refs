Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2478:

**CVE-2009-2478:**

*   **Root Cause:** A crash occurs in the Adobe Flash plugin (NPSWF32.dll) when scrolling a Flash animation with `wmode=transparent` that is initially loaded outside the visible screen area. The root cause appears to be a null dereference.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the way the Flash plugin handles rendering when `wmode=transparent` is used and the flash object is initially outside the visible area, causing a null pointer dereference during scroll operations.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact of this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, specifically a crash. While a crash is disruptive, the analysis suggests that it is not exploitable for arbitrary code execution because it is a null dereference, though it does use a memory corruption.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by crafting a web page that includes a Flash animation with `wmode=transparent`, placed initially outside the viewport. When a user scrolls to bring the Flash animation into view, the crash occurs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs the ability to host a web page with a malicious flash object and have a user with a vulnerable version of the flash plugin visit it. No other special capabilities are required, other than the ability to use HTML and Flash. The user must scroll the page to trigger the crash.
*   **Additional Notes:**
    *   The vulnerability was initially reported in Firefox 3.1b2 and is reproducible across multiple Windows versions (XP and Vista).
    *   The issue was ultimately resolved in a later release of the Flash plugin (10.0.32.18) after some initial issues with reported fixes.

**Additional notes:**

The provided content also references **CVE-2009-2477** which is a separate issue, involving a crash in the Javascript engine related to the `escape()` function, which also had a related exploit on milw0rm. This is not related to CVE-2009-2478, therefore this analysis is only focused on CVE-2009-2478.
