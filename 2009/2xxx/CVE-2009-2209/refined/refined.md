Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `rscms_mod_newsview.php` file of the RS-CMS 2.1 application. The `key` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization or parameterized queries for the `key` parameter within the `rscms_mod_newsview.php` script, leading to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords. The provided exploit demonstrates the ability to retrieve concatenated username and password values from the `users` table.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can lead to other attacks like modifying data, injecting malicious code, or potentially gaining control of the server and the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over HTTP via a crafted URL.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `key` parameter in the URL of the `rscms_mod_newsview.php` script to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** Basic understanding of SQL is necessary to craft effective injection payloads, although the provided example shows a complete payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to append a new row to the results that contains the desired data.
*   The attacker uses `concat(username,0x3a,password)` to retrieve the username and password fields, separated by a colon.
*   The `--` comment at the end of the query is used to ignore the rest of the original SQL query.
*   The `0x3a` is the hexadecimal representation for a colon, which is used as a separator between username and password.
