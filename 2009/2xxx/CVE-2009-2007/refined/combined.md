How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security audits for elearning

Security audits test the resistance of exposed elements on the Internet, such as an LMS (a management tool for online training), to malicious intrusions.

**Security audits test the resistance of exposed elements on the Internet, such as an LMS (a management tool for online training), to malicious intrusions.**

Web applications are often the most vulnerable part of a computer system. Before [deploying an LMS](https://www.dokeos.com/learning-management-system-lms/) – Learning Management System – in their organization, many companies must complete a security audit of their service.

## How are security audits conducted?

1. **We identify a variety of attack scenarios**, such as those involving connections to servers, identification of participants, strategic data, etc.
2. **We** then **simulate an attack**, in which a dynamic analysis is performed during the execution of the LMS, while employing unusual conditions of use.
3. **We repair the vulnerabilities:** the analysis makes it possible to identify data that would be otherwise inaccessible.
4. **We set priorities based on impacts:** a large volume of random data is generated following these attack scenarios. It is essential to have identified priority targets and rely on specialized tools to process information.
5. **We offer a list of areas for improvement**, with the final report presenting an implementation planning schedule.

## How are the conclusions presented?

The final report presents **risk level indicators** in terms of availability, confidentiality, etc. The methods are explained to expose the various existing security risks and their impact, as well as recommendations to correct them.

GSF, which has more than 60,000 employees, had Dokeos audited by experts in cybercrime and cybersecurity. The log of this audit is available to our major clients for the sake of transparency.
