{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize the `cookid` and `cookgid` cookies before using them in an SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially allowing them to extract sensitive data like password hashes. In this specific exploit, the password hash of the user with ID 1 is retrieved.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects SQL code through the `cookid` cookie. Specifically, they manipulate the `cookid` cookie with a crafted SQL query using UNION SELECT statement to extract the password hash.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to set the `cookid` and `cookgid` cookies. They also need to have a valid username and password to obtain a valid session. The provided exploit script automates this process."
