| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=515890#c0)  Marc Schoenefeld    2009-08-06 09:09:04 UTC  ``` A security vulnerability in the JNLPAppletLauncher may impact users of the Sun JDK and JRE. Non-current versions of the JNLPAppletLauncher may be re-purposed with an untrusted Java applet to write arbitrary files on the system of the user downloading and running the untrusted applet.  The JNLPAppletLauncher is a general purpose JNLP-based applet launcher class for deploying applets that use extension libraries containing native code.  <http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-263490-1>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=515890#c1)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-06 20:38:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Extras for RHEL 4   Extras for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1199 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1199.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=515890#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-06 20:42:19 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Extras for RHEL 4   Extras for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1200 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1200.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=515890#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-11-12 18:15:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Extras for RHEL 4   Extras for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1582 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1582.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=515890#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-11 13:43:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.1  Via RHSA-2009:1662 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1662.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=515890#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-01-14 16:32:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.3  Via RHSA-2010:0043 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0043.html>   ``` |  |

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- silc-toolkit
An update of slic-toolkit fixes a stack-based overflow that could be
triggered by encoding an ASN.1 OID (CVE-2008-7159) and several
format string bugs (CVE-2009-3051, CVE-2008-7160).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- open-iscsi
The iscsi\_discovery tool created predictable temporary files which
potentially allowed attackers to overwrite system files
(CVE-2009-1297).
Also some non-security bugs have been fixed:
- synchronize startup settings
- fix daemon segfault with CHAP
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE10-SP2, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- strongswan,freeswan,openswan
A previous fix for a flaw in the ASN.1 parser was incomplete and
had to be reworked (CVE-2009-2661).
This could lead to crashes of the pluto IKE daemon.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- mutt
mutt did not properly handle embedded NUL characters in X.509
certificates when comparing host names. Attackers could exploit that
to spoof SSL servers (CVE-2009-2408).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- openldap2
openldap did not properly handle embedded NUL characters in X.509
certificates when comparing host names. Attackers could exploit that
to spoof SSL servers (CVE-2009-2408).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- cyrus-imapd
This update of cyrus-imapd fixes a buffer overflow that occurs in snprintf()
due to incorrectly calculating the size of the destination buffer.
(CVE-2009-2632)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
This update of java-1\_6\_0-openjdk fixes the following issues:
- CVE-2009-2670: OpenJDK Untrusted applet System properties access

- CVE-2009-2673: OpenJDK proxy mechanism allows non-authorized socket
connections
- CVE-2009-2674: Java Web Start Buffer JPEG processing integer overflow
- CVE-2009-2675: Java Web Start Buffer unpack200 processing integer overflow
- CVE-2009-2625: OpenJDK XML parsing Denial-Of-Service
- CVE-2009-2475: OpenJDK information leaks in mutable variables
- CVE-2009-2476: OpenJDK OpenType checks can be bypassed
- CVE-2009-2689: OpenJDK JDK13Services grants unnecessary privileges
- CVE-2009-2690: OpenJDK private variable information disclosure
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0 and 11.1
- postgresql
Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in PostgrSQL
- CVE-2009-3229: allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial
of service
- CVE-2009-3230: allows remote authenticated users to gain higher
privileges
- CVE-2009-3231: when using LDAP authentication with anonymous
binds, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an
empty password
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- IBMJava2-JRE/java-1\_4\_2-ibm
IBM Java 1.4.2 was updated to SR13 FP1 to fix the following security
issues:
CVE-2009-2625: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with parsing XML data might allow a remote client to create a
denial-of-service condition on the system that the JRE runs on.
CVE-2008-5349: A vulnerability in how the Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) handles certain RSA public keys might cause the JRE to consume
an excessive amount of CPU resources. This might lead to a Denial of
Service (DoS) condition on affected systems. Such keys could be
provided by a remote client of an application.
This issue affects the following security providers: IBMJCE,
IBMPKCS11Impl and IBMJCEFIPS.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLES9, SLE11
- wireshark
Specially crafted packets could crash the OPC UA dissector in
Wireshark (CVE-2009-3241)
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- freeradius
This update of freeradius fixes a remote denial-of-service bug in
function rad\_decode() which can be triggered by zero-length
Tunnel-Password attributes to make radiusd crash (CVE-2009-3111).
Affected Products: openSUSE 10.3, SLE10-SP2, SLES9
- dovecot

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-openjdk packages that fix several security issues and a
bug are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the
OpenJDK 6 Software Development Kit. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
contains the software and tools that users need to run applications written
using the Java programming language.

A flaw was found in the way the XML Digital Signature implementation in the
JRE handled HMAC-based XML signatures. An attacker could use this flaw to
create a crafted signature that could allow them to bypass authentication,
or trick a user, applet, or application into accepting untrusted content.
(CVE-2009-0217)

Several potential information leaks were found in various mutable static
variables. These could be exploited in application scenarios that execute
untrusted scripting code. (CVE-2009-2475)

It was discovered that OpenType checks can be bypassed. This could allow a
rogue application to bypass access restrictions by acquiring references to
privileged objects through finalizer resurrection. (CVE-2009-2476)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way the JRE processes XML. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to supply crafted XML that would lead
to a denial of service. (CVE-2009-2625)

A flaw was found in the JRE audio system. An untrusted applet or
application could use this flaw to gain read access to restricted System
properties. (CVE-2009-2670)

Two flaws were found in the JRE proxy implementation. An untrusted applet
or application could use these flaws to discover the usernames of users
running applets and applications, or obtain web browser cookies and use
them for session hijacking attacks. (CVE-2009-2671, CVE-2009-2672)

An additional flaw was found in the proxy mechanism implementation. This
flaw allowed an untrusted applet or application to bypass access
restrictions and communicate using non-authorized socket or URL connections
to hosts other than the origin host. (CVE-2009-2673)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the JRE processes JPEG
images. An untrusted application could use this flaw to extend its
privileges, allowing it to read and write local files, as well as to
execute local applications with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2009-2674)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the JRE unpack200 functionality. An
untrusted applet or application could extend its privileges, allowing it to
read and write local files, as well as to execute local applications with
the privileges of the user running the applet or application. (CVE-2009-2675)

It was discovered that JDK13Services grants unnecessary privileges to
certain object types. This could be misused by an untrusted applet or
application to use otherwise restricted functionality. (CVE-2009-2689)

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way private Java variables
were handled. An untrusted applet or application could use this flaw to
obtain information from variables that would otherwise be private.
(CVE-2009-2690)

Note: The flaws concerning applets in this advisory, CVE-2009-2475,
CVE-2009-2670, CVE-2009-2671, CVE-2009-2672, CVE-2009-2673, CVE-2009-2675,
CVE-2009-2689, and CVE-2009-2690, can only be triggered in
java-1.6.0-openjdk by calling the "appletviewer" application.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* the EVR in the java-1.6.0-openjdk package as shipped with Red Hat

Enterprise Linux allowed the java-1.6.0-openjdk package from the EPEL
repository to take precedence (appear newer). Users using
java-1.6.0-openjdk from EPEL would not have received security updates since
October 2008. This update prevents the packages from EPEL from taking
precedence. (BZ#499079)

All users of java-1.6.0-openjdk are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which resolve these issues. All running instances of OpenJDK Java
must be restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use

# Sun JDK/JRE: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200911-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Sun JDK and JRE allow for several attacks,
including the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/sun-jre-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.0.17** |

| Package | **app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.0.17** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.5.0.22**>= **1.6.0.17** |

### Background

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the Sun Java
implementation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below and
the associated Sun Alerts for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted JAR
archive, applet, or Java Web Start application, possibly resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. Furthermore, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of
Service affecting multiple services via several vectors, disclose
information and memory contents, write or execute local files, conduct
session hijacking attacks via GIFAR files, steal cookies, bypass the
same-origin policy, load untrusted JAR files, establish network
connections to arbitrary hosts and posts via several vectors, modify
the list of supported graphics configurations, bypass HMAC-based
authentication systems, escalate privileges via several vectors and
cause applet code to be executed with older, possibly vulnerable
versions of the JRE.

NOTE: Some vulnerabilities require a trusted environment, user
interaction, a DNS Man-in-the-Middle or Cross-Site-Scripting attack.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Sun JRE 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JRE 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JDK 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JDK 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.6.0.17"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.5.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.5.0.22"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.6.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JRE 1.4.x, Sun JDK 1.4.x, Blackdown JRE, Blackdown JDK and
precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.4.x users are strongly advised to unmerge
Java 1.4:

```
 # emerge --unmerge =app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jdk-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jdk
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jre
```

Gentoo is ceasing support for the 1.4 generation of the Sun Java
Platform in accordance with upstream. All 1.4 JRE and JDK versions are
masked and will be removed shortly.
