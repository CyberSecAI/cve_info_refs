  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-2084",
      "root_cause": "SLURM daemons do not drop supplemental groups before executing user commands.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `sbcast` command may inherit the supplementary group list from the `slurmd` daemon, which may include system groups with elevated privileges.",
        "The `strigger` command, when SlurmUser is configured as root, may execute programs with the supplementary group list inherited from `slurmctld` daemon, potentially with elevated privileges."
      ],
      "impact": "A valid SLURM user may be able to write files in directories with group write access for one of the inherited groups, and/or may be able to overwrite files with similar group write access. This could lead to privilege escalation depending on the system configuration.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Executing `sbcast` command.",
         "Executing `strigger` command."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "A valid SLURM user can exploit this vulnerability.",
	  "more_info": "The vulnerability is caused by the SLURM daemons not properly setting user supplementary groups before opening files for writing or executing commands, inheriting the supplementary group list from the daemon which might include system groups with elevated privileges."
