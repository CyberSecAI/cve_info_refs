{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses user-controlled input from the 'name' parameter in the URL to construct a file path without proper sanitization, leading to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or other data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'name' parameter in the URL to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., '../../../../../../etc/passwd') and null byte injection (%00), an attacker can force the application to include arbitrary files.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special position is required beyond being able to access the application."
