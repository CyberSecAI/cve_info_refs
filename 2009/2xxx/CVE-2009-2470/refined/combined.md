How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-38

## Data corruption with SOCKS5 reply containing DNS name longer than 15 characters

Announced
July 21, 2009
Reporter
Andrej Andolsek
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.12
* Firefox 3.5.2

### Description

**Andrej Andolsek** reported that when Firefox
receives a reply from a SOCKS5 proxy which contains a DNS name longer
than 15 characters, the subsequent data stream in the response can
become corrupted. There was no evidence of memory corruption,
however, and the severity of the issue was determined to be low.

If Firefox receives SOCKS5 reply with DNS name longer than 15 characters then the subsequent data transfer will be corrupted. This will result with either pages being corrupted at the beginning, or with a Save As dialog being opened.
This quite possibly is a buffer overrun bug! And quite possibly it's an exploitable one too (that's why I'm classifying it as critical bug). It looks like Firefox can handle SOCKS5 replies up to 22 bytes in size - 22 bytes is needed for SOCKS5 reply holding IPv6 address. SOCKS5 reply with 15 character DNS name takes 22 bytes as well. Btw the maximum SOCKS5 reply is 262 bytes.

I've checked the code and it it's not a buffer overrun bug. In netwerk\socket\base\nsSOCKSIOLayer.cpp - function ConnectSOCKS5():
case 0x03: // FQDN (should not get this back)
default: // unknown format
// if we get here, we don't know our external address.
// however, as that's possibly not critical to the user,
// we let it slide.
PR\_InitializeNetAddr(PR\_IpAddrNull, 0, extAddr);
//return NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE;
break;
0x03 - DOMAINNAME can indeed be sent back, but it is highly unusual.
Let me explain how this can happen. Tunnelier is an SSH client that uses SOCKS proxy forwarding. Tunnelier acts as SOCKS proxy server, but connections to actual targets are made by SSH server. So when generating SOCKS5 reply Tunnelier must use the address of SSH server. Now comes the tricky part. If Tunnelier itself is connected through (regular) proxy server, and Tunnelier is configured not to resolve DNS name locally, then Tunnelier doesn't know the IP address of SSH server. Only in this case will Tunnelier use DNS name in SOCKS5 reply.
I propose the following code changes:
1) case 0x03 should simply skip bytes remaining - response\_len = 4 + 1 + response[4] + 2
2) default should yield failure, because you don't know how much bytes there is remaining in SOCKS5 reply.
Also I got a couple of more questions:
1) How come the code is happily reading response bytes without checking how much bytes it's been actually read? (What if PR\_Recv() read only 1 byte?)
2) What if 10 byte SOCKS5 reply is returned (IPv4) and PR\_Recv() reads whole 22 bytes? Well OK, HTTP server waits on HTTP request before sending anything, so that's why this works - but it doesn't look clean.

I agree there's no buffer overrun here.
If the socks response is larger that the largest size this code expects,
the excess response is left unread in the kernel's socket receive buffers,
where it will appear as a prefix to the next set of expected received data
(e.g. to the subsequent http response).
There could be an underrun. A "short read" could fail to read the entire
response into the reader's buffer before trying to parse it. The actual
amount of data read in is ignored, other than to assure it's not -1.
The code should deal with "short reads" properly.
Remember, http isn't the only protocol used over socks, and some protocols
are server-speaks-first, so reading in more data into the response buffer
than are actually contained in the socks response could cause some of
the initial data from the desired remote server to be read into the socks
response buffer and then discarded.
The right way to do this (IMO) is to initially read in 4 bytes, the header of
the socks response, then interpret the 4th byte to see the type of response
and its proper length. If that 4th byte is 03, then read in the 5th byte
for the length. Finally read in the rest of the response according to the
length determined. Deal with "short reads" at every step. This ensures
that no underruns occur, and we don't read in any of the target server's
data by assuming it to be part of the socks response.

The patches are basically the same. There is a difference in timeout handling.
PR\_InitializeNetAddr(PR\_IpAddrNull, 0, extAddr);
- //return NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE;
+ extPort = response[response\_len - 2] << 8) |
+ response[response\_len - 1];
break;
This is unnecessary since extPort isn't used anywhere.

The patches are similar, but don't address the same set of issues exactly.
Michal's also attempts to address correcting timeout computations, which
seems good. Mine also attempts to address a couple issues in parsing the
SOCKS5 response while not increasing the number of PR\_Recv calls more than
necessary.
Michal spotted a bug in my patch. extPort SHOULD be used. It should be
computed before the call to PR\_InitializeNetAddr, and the value should be
used in that call. e.g.
- PR\_InitializeNetAddr(PR\_IpAddrNull, 0, extAddr);
- //return NS\_ERROR\_FAILURE;
+ extPort = response[response\_len - 2] << 8) |
+ response[response\_len - 1];
+ PR\_InitializeNetAddr(PR\_IpAddrNull, extPort, extAddr);
This should be done for the FQDN case, only, as my patch does.

This patch is v1 plus the changes I suggested previously.
Do we have any one who can test this with a real socks server to ensure
no regressions? My employer has stopped using socks servers and I no
longer have any with which to test.

A bracket is missing before response.
I've tested it with antinat and SSH's SOCK server and found no regression. My SSH (openssh-5.1p1-3.fc10.x86\_64) connected through proxy as described in [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=459524#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - SOCKS5 reply with DNS name longer than 15 characters corrupts data") doesn't return response with FQDN but also IPv4 with both ip and port zeroed. I've build my own patched version of antinat to test this potential problem and it works correctly. I've also tested "byte by byte" relaying ([bug #353040](/show_bug.cgi?id=353040 "RESOLVED FIXED - Wrong handling of SOCKS v5 CONNECT Replies from socks server.")) and it also works.

Yeah, I can back it out.
This is a tiny regression in absolute terms (<2ms) so I'm a little worried about the noise floor, but on the graph it's visible, so I'm hoping the backout effect will be similarly evident.
<http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.1/rev/625424863025>
Cancelling the fixed1.9.1 keyword instead of re-opening, since this is still landed on trunk (where it doesn't seem to have caused any Tp blip at all:

Looks like the backout did bring numbers down, though again, it's noisy.
<http://graphs-new.mozilla.org/graph.html#tests=[{%22test%22:%221%22,%22branch%22:%223%22,%22machine%22:%2235%22},{%22test%22:%222%22,%22branch%22:%223%22,%22machine%22:%2232%22},{%22test%22:%222%22,%22branch%22:%223%22,%22machine%22:%2233%22},{%22test%22:%222%22,%22branch%22:%223%22,%22machine%22:%2234%22},{%22test%22:%2211%22,%22branch%22:%223%22,%22machine%22:%2248%22>}]
There's all the XP boxes doing Tp (including a nochrome and a tp\_fast box). If you look at 4/14, around 10:30AM, you can see the drop. NoChrome, for instance, drops from 150.58 to 147.93. Unfortunately it looks like something else regressed Tp not long afterwards (and then maybe was backed out or counterbalanced by a win?)
It's a mess, but I do think the data supports the theory that this patch has a Tp hit on XP.
Is that expected and understood and worth it, or mystical?

Absolutely mystical: I'm almost positive our tests don't hit SOCKS proxies at all, which would mean this code isn't even run.

I imagined that these page load time results must be using proxies,
because why else would socks proxy code be getting called?
If this code is not being called and it affects page load times, then it does
border on mystical. But I've seen situations where the mere insertion of a
single line of code causes other code to be moved in the process address space, such that new and frequent collisions occur in the instruction cache. On some
platforms, such as Solaris, there are optimization techniques that can greatly
reduce i-cache collisions. I'm not aware of any for Windows though.

IMO, testing this requires having a SOCKS5 server that can be used to
inject malicious (or simply out of spec) replies.
Perhaps the reporter can help?

As I mentioned in [comment #14](/show_bug.cgi?id=459524#c14 "RESOLVED FIXED - SOCKS5 reply with DNS name longer than 15 characters corrupts data") I've used modified SOCKS server Antinat to test this bug. I can temporarily set it up on my server for verification it you want.
