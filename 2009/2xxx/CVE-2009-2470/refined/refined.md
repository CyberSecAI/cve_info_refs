Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-2470:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of SOCKS5 proxy replies by Mozilla Firefox. Specifically, if the SOCKS5 reply contains a DNS name (FQDN) longer than 15 characters, the subsequent data stream in the response can become corrupted. This is due to the code incorrectly calculating the length of the SOCKS5 response when a DNS name is present, leading to misinterpretation of the data that follows the initial response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Length Calculation:** The code does not correctly parse and determine the length of a SOCKS5 reply when it contains a domain name (FQDN) longer than 15 characters.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate or handle SOCKS5 replies of varying lengths, particularly when the type is DOMAINNAME (0x03). This leads to potential misinterpretation of response data.
- **Short Read Handling:** The code does not properly handle situations where `PR_Recv()` returns a short read, leading to potential data corruption or discarding of subsequent data from the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Corruption:** When the vulnerability is triggered, the data stream following the SOCKS5 reply can become corrupted, potentially resulting in the corruption of web pages or the triggering of unwanted "Save As" dialogs.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** Incorrect handling of the response can lead to unexpected application behavior.
- **Potential Exposure of Data:** While there is no evidence of memory corruption, the improper handling could potentially expose data due to how the subsequent data from the target server is treated.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SOCKS5 Proxy:** An attacker can set up a malicious SOCKS5 proxy server that sends responses with an FQDN longer than 15 characters.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker positioned as a man-in-the-middle could intercept and modify SOCKS5 responses to include a lengthy FQDN.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must control or have influence over the SOCKS5 proxy used by the victim.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the response from the SOCKS5 proxy, crafting a reply that contains a DNS name (FQDN) that exceeds 15 characters.
- The attacker could also be positioned as a man-in-the-middle in network communication between the client and the SOCKS5 proxy.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to SOCKS5 proxies.
- The vulnerability is not a buffer overflow/overrun.
- The issue was initially classified as critical but later reduced to minor after the exact nature of the vulnerability was understood.
- The fix involves correctly calculating the length of the SOCKS5 reply based on its type (including DOMAINNAME), and correctly handle potential short reads from PR_Recv().
- The patch includes logic to handle FQDN type replies by reading the length byte and skipping the remaining bytes of the DNS name in the response.
- The corrected code uses the port from the SOCKS5 response in subsequent operations.
- The fix was initially introduced in Firefox 3.0.12 and Firefox 3.5.2.
