- Root cause of vulnerability: The Joomla! component com_realestatemanager 1.0 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). This is due to the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `toolbar_ext.php` file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious code, which will be executed on the server, potentially leading to complete compromise of the web server and the underlying system.
- Attack vectors: By sending a crafted request to `toolbar_ext.php` with a `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter pointing to a remote file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla instance. The attacker also needs to have a publicly available malicious PHP file.
