  "CVE-2009-2673": {
    "Description": "An additional flaw was found in the proxy mechanism implementation. This flaw allowed an untrusted applet or application to bypass access restrictions and communicate using non-authorized socket or URL connections to hosts other than the origin host.",
    "Root cause": "Flaw in the JRE proxy mechanism implementation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect proxy mechanism implementation allowing non-authorized socket connections"
    ],
    "Impact": "An untrusted applet or application could bypass access restrictions and establish unauthorized socket or URL connections to hosts other than the origin host.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Untrusted applet or application exploiting the JRE proxy mechanism implementation."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to run untrusted applets or applications."
