```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The Zope Object Database (ZODB) Zope Enterprise Objects (ZEO) server implementation has a vulnerability that allows unauthorized file access.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The vulnerability allows any file readable by the server to be read by clients and any file removable by the server to be removed.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker could potentially read sensitive files on the server, and remove files accessible by the server, leading to data loss or exposure.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is present in the ZEO server when configured to support blobs and accessed by untrusted clients. The vulnerability is accessible via network connections to the ZEO server.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be an untrusted client connected to the ZEO server and the ZEO server must be configured to support blobs.
