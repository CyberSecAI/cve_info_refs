```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly uses a user-supplied `cwd` parameter to define the `SMARTY_DIR` constant, which is then used in a `require_once` statement. This allows an attacker to control the path of the included file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code or disclosure of sensitive information, depending on the content of the included files and the application's handling of them.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `cwd` parameter in the `smarty.php` script's URL, an attacker can specify a path to a file to be included.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the application and the ability to send HTTP requests. The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users."
