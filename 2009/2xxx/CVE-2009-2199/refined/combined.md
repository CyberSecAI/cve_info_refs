How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# About the security content of iOS 3.1 and iOS 3.1.1 for iPod touch

This document describes the security content of iOS 3.1 and iOS 3.1.1 for iPod touch.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see "[How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620)."

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see "[Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222)."

#### iOS 3.1 and iOS 3.1.1 for iPod touch

* **CoreAudio**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2206

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.0.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.0

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted AAC or MP3 file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in the handling of AAC or MP3 files. Opening a maliciously crafted AAC or MP3 file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. Credit to Tobias Klein of trapkit.de for reporting this issue.

* **Exchange Support**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2794

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.0.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.0

  Impact: A person with physical access to a device may be able to use it after the timeout period specified by an Exchange administrator

  Description: iOS provides the ability to communicate via services provided by a Microsoft Exchange server. An administrator of an Exchange server has the ability to specify a "Maximum inactivity time lock" setting. This requires the user to reenter their passcode after the expiration of the inactivity time in order to use the Exchange services. iOS allows a user to specify a "Require Passcode" setting that may extend up to 4 hours. The "Require Passcode" setting is not affected by the "Maximum inactivity time lock" setting. If the user has "Require Passcode" set to a value higher than the "Maximum inactivity time lock" setting, this would allow a window of time for a person with physical access to use the device, including Exchange services. This update addresses the issue by disabling user choices for "Require Passcode" values greater than the "Maximum inactivity time lock" setting. This issue only affects iOS 2.0 and later, and iOS for iPod touch 2.0 and later. Credit to Allan Steven, Robert Duran, Jeff Beckham of PepsiCo, Joshua Levitsky, Michael Breton of Intel Corporation, Mike Karban of Edward Jones, and Steve Moriarty of Agilent Technologies for reporting this issue.

* **MobileMail**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2207

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.0.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.0

  Impact: Deleted email messages may still be visible through a Spotlight search

  Description: Spotlight finds and allows access to deleted messages in Mail folders on the device. This would allow a person with access to the device to view the deleted messages. This update addresses the issue by not including the deleted email in the Spotlight search result. This issue only affects iOS 3.0, iOS 3.0.1, and iOS for iPod touch 3.0. Credit to Clickwise Software and Tony Kavadias for reporting this issue.

* **Recovery Mode**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2795

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.0.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.0

  Impact: A person with physical access to a locked device may be able to access the user's data

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in Recovery Mode command parsing. This may allow another person with physical access to the device to bypass the passcode, and access the user's data. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking.

* **Telephony**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2815

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.0.1

  Impact: Receiving a maliciously crafted SMS message may lead to an unexpected service interruption

  Description: A null pointer dereference issue exists in the handling of SMS arrival notifications. Receiving a maliciously crafted SMS message may lead to an unexpected service interruption. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of incoming SMS messages. Credit to Charlie Miller of Independent Security Evaluators, and Collin Mulliner of Technical University Berlin for reporting this issue.

* **UIKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2796

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.0.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.0

  Impact: Passwords may be made visible

  Description: When a character in a password is deleted, and the deletion is undone, the character is briefly made visible. This may allow a person with physical access to the device to read a password, one character at a time. This update addresses the issue by preventing the character from being made visible. This issue only affects iOS 3.0 and iOS 3.0.1. Credit to Abraham Vegh for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2797

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.0.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.0

  Impact: User names and passwords in URLs may be disclosed to linked sites

  Description: Safari includes the user name and password from the original URL in the referer header. This may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by not including user names and passwords in referer headers. Credit to James A. T. Rice of Jump Networks Ltd for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1725

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.0.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.0

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A memory corruption issue exists in WebKit's handling of numeric character references. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of numeric character references. Credit to Chris Evans for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1724

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.0.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.0

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: An issue in WebKit's handling of the parent and top objects may result in a cross-site scripting attack when visiting a maliciously crafted website. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of parent and top objects.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2199

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.0.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.0

  Impact: Look-alike characters in a URL could be used to masquerade a website

  Description: The International Domain Name (IDN) support and Unicode fonts embedded in Safari could be used to create a URL which contains look-alike characters. These could be used in a malicious website to direct the user to a spoofed site that visually appears to be a legitimate domain. This update addresses the issue by supplementing WebKit's list of known look-alike characters. Look-alike characters are rendered in Punycode in the address bar. Credit to Chris Weber of Casaba Security, LLC for reporting this issue.

# About the security content of Safari 4.0.3

This document describes the security content of Safari 4.0.3.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

#### Safari 4.0.3

* **CoreGraphics**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2468

  Available for: Windows XP and Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in the drawing of long text strings. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. Credit to Will Drewry of Google Inc for reporting this issue.

* **ImageIO**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2188

  Available for: Windows XP and Vista

  Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A buffer overflow exists in the handling of EXIF metadata. Viewing a maliciously crafted image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking.

* **Safari**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2196

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Windows XP and Vista

  Impact: A maliciously crafted website may be promoted into Safari's Top Sites view

  Description: Safari 4 introduced the Top Sites feature to provide an at-a-glance view of a user's favorite websites. It is possible for a malicious website to promote arbitrary sites into the Top Sites view through automated actions. This could be used to facilitate a phishing attack. This issue is addressed by preventing automated website visits from affecting the Top Sites list. Only websites that the user visits manually can be included in the Top Sites list. As a note, Safari enables fraudulent site detection by default. Since the introduction of the Top Sites feature, fraudulent sites are not displayed in the Top Sites view. Credit to Inferno of SecureThoughts.com for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2195

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Windows XP and Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A buffer overflow exists in WebKit's parsing of floating point numbers. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. Credit: Apple.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2200

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Windows XP and Vista

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website and clicking "Go" when viewing a malicious plug-in dialog may lead to the disclosure of sensitive information

  Description: WebKit allows the pluginspage attribute of the 'embed' element to reference file URLs. Clicking "Go" in the dialog that appears when an unknown plug-in type is referenced will redirect to the URL listed in the pluginspage attribute. This may allow a remote attacker to launch file URLs in Safari, and lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by restricting the pluginspage URL scheme to http or https. Credit to Alexios Fakos of n.runs AG for reporting this issue.

* **WebKit**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2199

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5.7, Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Windows XP and Vista

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
