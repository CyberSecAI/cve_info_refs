Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2910:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Linux kernel not properly clearing certain registers (R8-R11) before returning from kernel mode to user mode when a 32-bit process is run on a 64-bit (x86_64) system. This is because a 32-bit process can temporarily switch to 64-bit mode and potentially access these 64-bit registers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leak:** The core weakness is that the kernel leaks the contents of registers, which are not guaranteed to be preserved between context switches. This can lead to one process observing register values from a previously running process.
- **Improper Clearing of Registers:** The x86_64 kernel code path for returning to 32-bit userspace lacked the instruction to zero out the contents of r8-r11 registers that are not part of the x86-32 ABI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious or compromised 32-bit process running on an x86_64 system can gain access to the contents of r8-r11 registers of the previously running process. This information could potentially include sensitive data left by the earlier process.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While the primary impact is information disclosure, the leaked register data *could potentially be leveraged for further exploitation depending on what data is leaked, but is not clearly defined in the content provided.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploit:** The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.
- **32-bit Process on x86_64 System:** The vulnerable code path is triggered when a 32-bit application is run on a 64-bit system and switches to 64-bit mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute a custom 32-bit application that could switch to 64-bit mode.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**
- The vulnerability is specific to x86_64 architecture when a 32-bit process is run.
-  The affected registers are R8-R11, which are not part of the standard 32-bit x86 calling convention and are only used in x86_64 mode.
- The fix involves explicitly clearing the contents of these registers before returning to user mode from a 64-bit code path while returning to the 32-bit process.
- The vulnerability was also found in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4,5, and MRG, and was fixed via security advisories.
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise products
