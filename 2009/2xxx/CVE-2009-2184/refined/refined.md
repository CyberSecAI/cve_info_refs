Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `forcedownload.php` file of the Gravy Media Photo Host 1.0.8 application. Specifically, the application directly uses user-supplied input from the `file` GET parameter to construct a file path, which is then passed to the `readfile()` function. This allows for arbitrary file access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion flaw. The application doesn't validate or sanitize the `file` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file path on the server's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, source code, database credentials, and potentially even password files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`). This can lead to further exploitation, including privilege escalation and data breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `forcedownload.php` script, with the `file` parameter set to the path of the target file.
*   **Example:** `http://www.gravy-media.com/v108/forcedownload.php?file=/etc/passwd`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable Gravy Media Photo Host application.
*  **Basic understanding of file paths:** The attacker needs to understand file system pathing to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No prior authentication/authorization** is required.
