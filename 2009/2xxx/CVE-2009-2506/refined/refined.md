Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-2506:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the text converter for Word 97 (used by WordPad and Office text converters) processes specially crafted Word 97 documents. Specifically, a memory corruption vulnerability arises during the parsing of these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is a memory corruption issue, which occurs when the affected software parses a malformed Word 97 document. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability gains the same privileges as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the system, leading to the ability to:
    *   Install programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **System Compromise:** This could allow an attacker to gain full control of the system

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email:** Attackers can send specially crafted Word 97 files as email attachments, tricking users into opening them using WordPad or Microsoft Office.
*   **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host malicious web pages containing the specially crafted document. They rely on social engineering to convince users to visit the compromised site. Compromised web sites or sites with user-provided content could also host such content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** Attackers need the capability to create or obtain a specially crafted Word 97 file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers often need to employ social engineering tactics to convince users to open the malicious file or visit a malicious website.
*   **No Special Network Position:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects WordPad on Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003. It also impacts Microsoft Office XP, 2003, Converter Pack, and Works 8.5
*   **Mitigation:** User accounts with fewer privileges are less impacted.
*   **Workaround:** Disabling the WordPad text converter for Word 97 by restricting access to converter files.
*   **Severity:** Rated as "Important"
