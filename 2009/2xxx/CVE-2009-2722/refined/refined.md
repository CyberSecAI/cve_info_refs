    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote code execution vulnerability due to insufficient checks when handling crafted JAR archives, applets, or Java Web Start applications",
      "Denial of Service vulnerabilities affecting multiple services.",
      "Information disclosure vulnerability, potentially exposing memory contents.",
      "Vulnerabilities related to writing or executing local files, leading to possible privilege escalation.",

        "Cookie stealing vulnerability",
        "Bypass of the same-origin policy",
        "Loading of untrusted JAR files",
        "Establishment of network connections to arbitrary hosts.",
       "Modification of the list of supported graphics configurations",

    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application, cause denial of service, disclose sensitive information, write or execute local files, hijack user sessions, and more.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening specially crafted JAR archives",
