Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-2459 (Note: This is a placeholder, but the content clearly relates to mimetex vulnerabilities)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in `mimetex.cgi` due to insufficient bounds checking when processing user-supplied TeX expressions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflows. The program fails to validate the size of input buffers leading to overflowing the stack when processing certain TeX expressions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary code by crafting specific TeX expressions to overwrite the return address on the stack, allowing them to control the program flow and potentially gain control of the server.
- Information disclosure: The buffer overflows could also lead to information disclosure by leaking sensitive information from the stack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted TeX expressions: Attackers can supply specially crafted TeX expressions via HTTP requests to `mimetex.cgi`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting `mimetex.cgi`.
- No authentication or special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Specific vulnerable TeX expressions provided:**

```
./mimetex.cgi "\picture(12,34){(AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA$10,10){testing}}"

./mimetex.cgi "\circle(10;`perl -e 'print "A"x400'`)"

./mimetex.cgi "\input[`perl -e 'print "A"x2000'`]{mimetex.cgi}"
```

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in `mimetex` versions prior to June 17, 2009.
- The vulnerability was found by Google.
- The `\environ`, `\input` and `\counter` directives have been disabled by default as they are considered unsuitable for exposure to untrusted input.
