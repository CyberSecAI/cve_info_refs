Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2477:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler of the JavaScript engine in Mozilla Firefox 3.5. Specifically, the issue arises during deep bailing, a process where the JIT compiler reverts to the interpreter.
- The root cause is that the return value from a native function, like `escape()`, is not properly restored when the JIT compiler bails out. This leads to the use of uninitialized memory, causing a crash during interpretation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The core vulnerability is a memory corruption issue due to the improper handling of return values after JIT bailouts. This can lead to exploitable situations.
- **Uninitialized Memory Usage:** The use of uninitialized memory after a bailout is the immediate trigger of the crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution by crafting a malicious web page with specific JavaScript. This means an attacker could gain control of the user's system.
- **Denial of Service (Crash):** A less severe impact is that the exploit causes the browser to crash due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by tricking a user into visiting a malicious web page.
- **Client-Side Exploitation:** The attack occurs within the user's browser, on the client-side.
- **JavaScript:** The attack relies on malicious JavaScript code embedded in a web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Host Malicious Web Page:** The attacker must be able to host a malicious web page containing the exploit code.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a user to visit the malicious page, making it a social engineering component to the attack.
- **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs technical knowledge to craft the exploit code, specifically around JavaScript heap spraying techniques.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was quickly addressed by Mozilla.
- Public proof-of-concept exploits were available soon after the vulnerability was discovered.
-  The vulnerability is related to the handling of the 'escape()' javascript function and also likely 'unescape()'
- The fix involves correcting the way that return values are handled by the JIT compiler after a bail-out.
- The vulnerability only affects Firefox 3.5, which incorporated the new JIT features. Earlier versions of Firefox are not impacted.
- Mitigations included disabling the JIT compiler or using NoScript extension.

**Content Overview:**

The content included two exploit-db entries (one with a Python webserver), mozilla advisory and bugzilla entry, a mozilla blog post, a kb.cert.org entry and some other less relevant web pages.
