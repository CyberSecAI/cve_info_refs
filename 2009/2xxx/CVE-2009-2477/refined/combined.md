##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-41

## Corrupt JIT state after deep return from native function

Announced
July 16, 2009
Reporter
zbyte
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.1

### Description

Firefox user **zbyte** reported a crash that we determined
could result in an exploitable memory corruption problem. In certain cases
after a return from a native function, such as `escape()`, the
Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler could get into a corrupt state. This could be
exploited by an attacker to run arbitrary code such as installing malware.

We would like to thank community members **Lucas
Kruijswijk** and **Nochum Sossonko** for isolating
the problematic script from the original crashing site.

This vulnerability does not affect earlier versions of Firefox which
do not support the JIT feature.

### Workaround

Users of Firefox 3.5 can avoid this vulnerability by disabling the
Just-in-Time compiler as described in the
[Mozilla Security Blog](http://blog.mozilla.com/security/2009/07/14/critical-javascript-vulnerability-in-firefox-35/). That workaround is not necessary in
Firefox 3.5.1 and can be reverted.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

FTR, the line numbers for strict warnings and errors are totally borked for that file. Also, it dies in the function escapeData right after the "avto ??????" entry. I couldn't really reduce it anymore, anything I do stops crashing.

This is a JS engine bug dealing with deep bailing not properly restoring the return value from the result of the (fast native) escape function. We then try to do something with the uninitialized memory and crash in the interpreter.

Andreas mostly came up with this patch. I sort of followed along and verified that it fixes the crash. It also makes sense to me.
I don't have any clue how to make a trace-test for this... We can use Lucas' testcase as a mochitest, though.

Since this bug is memory corruption and the 'escape' function is not exotic, other crashes could be in fact this bug (this bug is pretty serious).
I suspect [bug 503144](/show_bug.cgi?id=503144 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash in [@ js3250.dll@0x68bec] [@ specializeTreesToMissingGlobals(JSContext*, TreeInfo*) ] visiting certain pages") being a duplicate of this.

Right, the trend with this recent spill of JS crashes are all foreign sites making use of escape();

Just a question. Could the same bug appear with other builtin functions, like unescape? Or, does the patch solve all builtin function problems?
I was searching in crash sites and found something with an 'unescape' but without an 'escape'.

Looking at the exploit code and our test cases, I think this is self-inflicted and we should have hidden the bug earlier. But this is very hard to judge to be hones.t I wouldn't entire exclude fuzzing or random heap spraying as method of discovery. Maybe someone with more experience on how such exploits are discovered wants to weigh in.

It would seem that the milw0rm exploit code is based on the testcases for this bug. When you look at the crash details in a debugger, it's pretty clear that it's exploitable with a heap spray to the access violation address in question.

I don't know know anything about the usual policy for hiding bugs, but in general, whether or not you publish something like that, security by obscurity in general is bad. There are always hackers out there trying to make a name for themselves and they'll throw every combination of fuzzers to find an exploit and make a name for themselves. Even if these testcases weren't visible, it was just a matter of time before someone would have gotten lucky and found the exploit.

True - but the \_speed\_ of fuzzers won't be faster than just heading to a not-yet-hidden-but-exploit-is-there-for-the-taking bug and taking the code to create an exploit. Note that the code in question apparently is identical to the testcase (if true), per [comment #34](/show_bug.cgi?id=503286#c34 "VERIFIED FIXED - browser crash when search suggestions show [@ js_Interpret ] [@ js_Execute]").
The delay created by security through obscurity is bad, but it has its merits by providing some sort of delay, which is better than no delay at all (as in this case). Here we have an exploit created from a known bug that should have been hidden from the onset, reflecting probably on our shortcoming in some way, no one's mistake in particular.
But I digress...

I made the first test case, but I am not from Mozilla. If a good reproducible crash is sufficient to turn the security flag on, then [bug 502648](/show_bug.cgi?id=502648 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash when scrolling in Flash with wmode=transparent [NPSWF32.dll@0x50abd]") (flash bug) should also get the security flag on. A bug no one is working on, yet.

If it's reproducible and the stack trace shows signs of exploitability, yes. [Bug 502648](/show_bug.cgi?id=502648 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash when scrolling in Flash with wmode=transparent [NPSWF32.dll@0x50abd]") looks like a null deref, which is not exploitable. See <http://www.squarefree.com/2006/11/02/determining-whether-a-crash-looks-exploitable/> for how I evaluate crash stacks.

I only volunteer to make some test cases. Someone from Mozilla should have done this check and added it to [bug 502648](/show_bug.cgi?id=502648 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash when scrolling in Flash with wmode=transparent [NPSWF32.dll@0x50abd]") (I will copy this info now).

A good, reproducible testcase is sufficient to run through a debugger and get a good idea whether it's exploitable or not. [Comment 14](/show_bug.cgi?id=503286#c14 "VERIFIED FIXED - browser crash when search suggestions show [@ js_Interpret ] [@ js_Execute]") is around when this turned into a security bug.
[bug 502648](/show_bug.cgi?id=502648 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash when scrolling in Flash with wmode=transparent [NPSWF32.dll@0x50abd]") looks like a null dereference which are not exploitable (usually -- sometimes the particular testcase results in a near-null but the bug might behave differently in other cases).

And it's much appreciated!! Once we have a testcase everything else is easy (often including the fix). Just keep sticking the testcase keyword up there when you do and it shows up in our triage queries.

Maybe off topic, but I don't know where to ask.
The site:
<http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/>
Has crashed per URL, but only for FF3.1b2. I can't get a list for FF3.5. Is this deliberate (for security)?
I managed to produce [bug 502648](/show_bug.cgi?id=502648 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash when scrolling in Flash with wmode=transparent [NPSWF32.dll@0x50abd]") from that list, but I don't have any reproduction work now. There is nothing interesting in bugzilla anymore.

No, it's non-deliberate, it's a bug with the site. :)

# Critical JavaScript vulnerability in Firefox 3.5

Al Billings
July 14, 2009

[80 responses](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2009/07/14/critical-javascript-vulnerability-in-firefox-35/#comments)

**Issue**

A bug discovered last week in Firefox 3.5’s Just-in-time (JIT) JavaScript compiler was disclosed [publicly](http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/9137) yesterday. It is a critical vulnerability that can be used to execute malicious code.

**Impact**

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who tricks a victim into viewing a malicious Web page containing the exploit code. The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the JIT in the JavaScript engine. To do so:

1. Enter `about:config` in the browser’s location bar.
2. Type `jit` in the Filter box at the top of the config editor.
3. Double-click the line containing `javascript.options.jit.content` setting the value to false.

Note that disabling the JIT will result in decreased JavaScript performance and is only recommended as a temporary security measure.  Once users have been received the security update containing the fix for this issue, they should restore the JIT setting to true by:

1. Enter `about:config` in the browser’s location bar.
2. Type `jit` in the Filter box at the top of the config editor.
3. Double-click the line containing `javascript.options.jit.content` setting the value to true.

Alternatively, users can disable the JIT by running Firefox in [Safe Mode](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe%2BMode).  Windows users can do so by selecting `Mozilla Firefox (Safe Mode)` from the Mozilla Firefox folder.

**Status**

Mozilla developers are working on a fix for this issue and a Firefox security update will be sent out as soon as the fix is completed and tested.

**Credit**

Zbyte reported this issue to Mozilla and Lucas Kruijswijk helped reduce the exploit test case.

**Update**: This vulnerability has been fixed in [Firefox 3.5.1](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.5.1/releasenotes/), released Thursday, July 16, 2009

    >
    > I’ve been running it for years and it’s just about the best Internet-oriented add-on I’ve ever run. Combined with adblock plus it reduces site load time on complex pages almost in half by blocking content and scripts that are loaded from third-party sources which I have no interest in running. I’m absolutely certain that unless one of the handful of sites I regularly used gets infected, that Noscript would do well to protect anyone using it from this.

    > @ BKF – The author of NoScript recently included code intended to disable parts of Adblock Plus. They’ve gotten their wrists slapped for it, but as a result NoScript is not to be trusted. I use the RequestPolicy extension instead to block unwanted third-party content, and it’s a lot easier to manage than NoScript’s zillions of unnecessary options.

    > @Kevin: are you using Firefox 3.5 or 3.0? It’s not expected to do anything in Firefox 3.0. It also won’t affect 3.5 if you’ve disabled the JIT, are running in “safe mode” (which disables the JIT), or have JavaScript turned off.

FTR, the line numbers for strict warnings and errors are totally borked for that file. Also, it dies in the function escapeData right after the "avto ??????" entry. I couldn't really reduce it anymore, anything I do stops crashing.

This is a JS engine bug dealing with deep bailing not properly restoring the return value from the result of the (fast native) escape function. We then try to do something with the uninitialized memory and crash in the interpreter.

Andreas mostly came up with this patch. I sort of followed along and verified that it fixes the crash. It also makes sense to me.

I don't have any clue how to make a trace-test for this... We can use Lucas' testcase as a mochitest, though.

Since this bug is memory corruption and the 'escape' function is not exotic, other crashes could be in fact this bug (this bug is pretty serious).

I suspect [bug 503144](/bugs/503144) being a duplicate of this. And I have seen another crash report, which could be a duplicate of this (I have to look that up).

Right, the trend with this recent spill of JS crashes are all foreign sites making use of escape();

Just a question. Could the same bug appear with other builtin functions, like unescape? Or, does the patch solve all builtin function problems?

I was searching in crash sites and found something with an 'unescape' but without an 'escape'.

Fix Andreas came up with

Is the declaration of deepBailSp missing?

r=me assuming that's the only thing.

Not sure what the internal policy is on publicly known exploits and hiding bugs or not. Someone versed in policy stuff please decide whether to unhide or not :)

Looking at the exploit code and our test cases, I think this is self-inflicted and we should have hidden the bug earlier. But this is very hard to judge to be hones.t I wouldn't entire exclude fuzzing or random heap spraying as method of discovery. Maybe someone with more experience on how such exploits are discovered wants to weigh in.

It would seem that the milw0rm exploit code is based on the testcases for this bug. When you look at the crash details in a debugger, it's pretty clear that it's exploitable with a heap spray to the access violation address in question.

I don't know know anything about the usual policy for hiding bugs, but in general, whether or not you publish something like that, security by obscurity in general is bad. There are always hackers out there trying to make a name for themselves and they'll throw every combination of fuzzers to find an exploit and make a name for themselves. Even if these testcases weren't visible, it was just a matter of time before someone would have gotten lucky and found the exploit.

True - but the \_speed\_ of fuzzers won't be faster than just heading to a not-yet-hidden-but-exploit-is-there-for-the-taking bug and taking the code to create an exploit. Note that the code in question apparently is identical to the testcase (if true), per comment #34.

The delay created by security through obscurity is bad, but it has its merits by providing some sort of delay, which is better than no delay at all (as in this case). Here we have an exploit created from a known bug that should have been hidden from the onset, reflecting probably on our shortcoming in some way, no one's mistake in particular.

But I digress...

yeah, well, linking the bugzilla bugs from crash-stats.mozilla.com is certainly an optimization, no matter how you look at it.

Created attachment 388437

For 1.9.1

The merge was pretty trivial, though!

just ran this from last night's nightly, and still crashing on the testcase.

Did this not get picked up by the builder?

verified fixed in latest hourly build.

from:

<http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.1/rev/f223409207c0>

looking at the time I pasted above, it's not surprising the fix was not in that build (checkin was 11 hours later).

I made the first test case, but I am not from Mozilla. If a good reproducible crash is sufficient to turn the security flag on, then [bug 502648](/bugs/502648) (flash bug) should also get the security flag on. A bug no one is working on, yet.

If it's reproducible and the stack trace shows signs of exploitability, yes. [Bug 502648](/bugs/502648) looks like a null deref, which is not exploitable. See <http://www.squarefree.com/2006/11/02/determining-whether-a-crash-looks-exploitable/> for how I evaluate crash stacks.

A good, reproducible testcase is sufficient to run through a debugger and get a good idea whether it's exploitable or not. Comment 14 is around when this turned into a security bug.

[bug 502648](/bugs/502648) looks like a null dereference which are not exploitable (usually -- sometimes the particular testcase results in a near-null but the bug might behave differently in other cases).

And it's much appreciated!! Once we have a testcase everything else is easy (often including the fix). Just keep sticking the testcase keyword up there when you do and it shows up in our triage queries.

Maybe off topic, but I don't know where to ask.

The site:

<http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/>

Has crashed per URL, but only for FF3.1b2. I can't get a list for FF3.5. Is this deliberate (for security)?

I managed to produce [bug 502648](/bugs/502648) from that list, but I don't have any reproduction work now. There is nothing interesting in bugzilla anymore.

No, it's non-deliberate, it's a bug with the site. :)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Mozilla Firefox 3.5 TraceMonkey JavaScript engine uninitialized memory vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#443060

Original Release Date: 2009-07-14 | Last Revised: 2009-07-17

---

### Overview

Mozilla Firefox's javascript engine contains a vulnerability that may allow an attacker to execute code.

### Description

| Mozilla Firefox version 3.5 contains a vulnerability in the [TraceMonkey](https://wiki.mozilla.org/JavaScript%3ATraceMonkey) components of Firefox's JavaScript engine.  Per Mozilla Bug Bug [503286](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=503286#c14):*"This is a JS engine bug dealing with deep bailing not properly restoring the return value from the result of the (fast native) escape function. We then try to do something with the uninitialized memory and crash in the interpreter."*Note that proof of concept code that demonstrates issue this is publicly available. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause Firefox to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Firefox 3.5.1 has been released to address this issue. See Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory [2009-41](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2009/mfsa2009-41.html) for more information. Until updates can be applied, the below workarounds may mitigate this issue. |
| --- |

| **Disable** **TraceMonkey**To disable the vulnerable components, use the [about:config](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firefox_%3A_FAQs_%3A_About%3Aconfig_Entries) interface to set javascript.options.jit.content and javascript.options.jit.chrome to false. This will still allow JavaScript to run, but it will disable the TraceMonkey performance enhancements.**Use NoScript**Using the Mozilla Firefox [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/722) extension to whitelist web sites that can run scripts will help to mitigate this vulnerability. Further details for configuring NoScript are available in the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#noscript) document.**Disable JavaScript**For instructions on how to disable JavaScript in Firefox, please refer to the Firefox section of the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Mozilla_Firefox) document. |
