```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `RGalleryUserGallery` page within the WBB3 rGallery component. The `userID` parameter within the URL is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Blind SQL Injection. The provided script leverages the vulnerability to extract information by comparing the ASCII values of characters in the password and salt to known character sets.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, including user passwords and salts, which can be used for account compromise or further malicious activities.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through a web request targeting the vulnerable URL, specifically the `index.php?page=RGalleryUserGallery&userID` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to make web requests to the vulnerable web application.
