  "CVE-2009-2471": {
    "description": "Mozilla developer Blake Kaplan reported that setTimeout, when called with certain object parameters which should be protected with a XPCNativeWrapper, will fail to keep the object wrapped when compiling the new function to be executed. If chrome privileged code were to call setTimeout using this as an argument, the this object will lose its wrapper and could be unsafely accessed by chrome code. An attacker could use such vulnerable code to run arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges.",
    "vulnerability": "The setTimeout function in Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.12 does not properly preserve object wrapping.",
    "impact": "An attacker could use such vulnerable code to run arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges or to launch a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack and run arbitrary JavaScript within the context of another site.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious website.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to have a malicious website or be able to inject malicious code into a site.",
    "root_cause": "When `setTimeout` is called with an object parameter that should be protected by `XPCNativeWrapper`, the object loses its wrapper during the compilation of the new function, leading to unsafe access by privileged chrome code."
