- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A resource consumption issue exists in the base station's handling of Router Advertisement (RA) and Neighbor Discovery (ND) packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The base station does not properly rate limit incoming ICMPv6 packets.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A system on the local network may send a large number of RA and ND packets, which could exhaust the base station's resources, causing it to restart unexpectedly, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a large number of IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) and Neighbor Discovery (ND) packets to the base station from a system on the local network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable base station and must be capable of sending IPv6 RA and ND packets.
