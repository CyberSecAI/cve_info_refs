#### FAQ for Null Truncation in X.509 Common Name Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2510

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a spoofing vulnerability. When combined with specific other attacks, such as DNS spoofing, this may allow an attacker to successfully spoof the digital certificate of a Web site for any application that uses the CryptoAPI.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows CryptoAPI incorrectly parses a null terminator as the end of any values identified by an Object Identifier (OID). This causes the CryptoAPI to only parse part of the actual value. When this partial value has meaning to the end user, this may lead to a situation where an attacker could impersonate another user or system.

**What is the Windows CryptoAPI?**

The CryptoAPI provide services that enable application developers to add encryption/decryption of data, authentication using digital certificates, and encoding to and decoding from Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) to their Windows-based applications. Application developers can use the functions in CryptoAPI without knowing details of the underlying implementation, in much the same way as they can use a graphics library without knowing anything about the particular graphics hardware configuration. CryptoAPI works with a number of Cryptographic Service Providers that perform the actual cryptographic functions.

**What is ASN.1?**

Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) is a data standard that is used by many applications and devices in the technology industry for allowing the normalization and understanding of data across various platforms. ASN.1 has no direct relationship to any specific standard, encoding method, programming language, or hardware platform. It is simply a language for defining standards; standards are written in ASN.1.

More information about ASN.1 can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 252648](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/252648).

**What is the X.509 standard?**

The X.509 specification defines a standard for managing public keys through a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Public keys are maintained in X.509 certificates, which are digital documents that bind a subject's identity claims to a public key from a public/private asymmetric key pair. Identity claims are usually understandable by humans, such as a person's full name or e-mail address, or a machine host name or domain name. X.509 certificates are endorsed and issued by a trusted third party, which is known as a certificate authority (CA).

**What is an Object Identifier or OID?**

Object Identifiers (OIDs) are numeric values issued by various issuing authorities to uniquely identify data elements, syntaxes, and other parts of distributed applications. OIDs are found in OSI applications, X.500 Directories, SNMP, and other applications where uniqueness is important. OIDs are based on a tree structure, in which a superior issuing authority, such as the ISO, allocates a branch of the tree to a sub-authority, who in turn can allocate sub-branches.

**What is a NULL terminator?**

A null terminator is a character with the value zero. In certain programming languages such as C, it is used as a reserved character to signify the end of a string.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker may be able to impersonate another user or system. Applications using the CryptoAPI to parse this data may return information to the user that could lead the user to make incorrect trust decisions.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could abuse this vulnerability by convincing a Certificate Authority trusted by the client to sign a certificate containing a null terminator in the Common Name (CN) field. The attacker could then set up a rogue Web site which serves this certificate to a Windows computer. The computer would then incorrectly parse the Common Name field and offer incorrect trust information to the user.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Clients that browse HTTPS Web sites, or use X.509 for certificates, for instance to protect e-mail conversations, are at particular risk for this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

This security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the CryptoAPI to reject Certificate Names that contain null terminators.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2009-2510](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2510).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Microsoft is aware of Proof of Concept code that was published which would allow an attacker to exploit this vulnerability in limited scenarios. However, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

## Integer Overflow in X.509 Object Identifiers Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2511

A spoofing vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI component when parsing ASN.1 object identifiers from X.509 certificates. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could impersonate another user or system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-2511](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2511).

#### Mitigating Factors for Integer Overflow in X.509 Object Identifiers Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2511

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Integer Overflow in X.509 Object Identifiers Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2511

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for Integer Overflow in X.509 Object Identifiers Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2511

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a spoofing vulnerability. When combined with specific other attacks, such as DNS spoofing, this may allow an attacker to successfully spoof the digital certificate of a Web site for any application that uses the CryptoAPI.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Windows CryptoAPI has an integer overflow when parsing ASN.1 object identifiers from X.509 certificates, such as the Common Name (CN). An attacker could generate a malicious certificate that would be parsed incorrectly by the Windows CryptoAPI, allowing the attacker to impersonate another user or system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could abuse this vulnerability by convincing a Certificate Authority trusted by the client to sign a certificate containing a malformed Object Identifier. The attacker could then set up a rogue Web site which serves this certificate to a Windows client. This client application would then incorrectly parse the Common Name field and offer incorrect trust information to the user.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Client applications that browse HTTPS web sites, or use X.509 for certificates, for instance to protect e-mail conversations, are at particular risk for this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

This security update addresses the vulnerability by causing the CryptoAPI to correctly validating ASN.1 Object Identifiers.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
