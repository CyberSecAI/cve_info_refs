  "cveId": "CVE-2009-2901",
  "date": "2009-07-30",
  "description": "By default, Tomcat automatically deploys any directories placed in a host's appBase. This behaviour is controlled by the autoDeploy attribute of a host which defaults to true. After a failed undeploy, the remaining files will be deployed as a result of the autodeployment process. Depending on circumstances, files normally protected by one or more security constraints may be deployed without those security constraints, making them accessible without authentication. This issue only affects Windows platforms.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "After a failed undeploy, files from previous deployments may remain in the appBase, which causes the auto-deploy process to deploy them again, potentially bypassing security constraints.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default configurations",
      "Inadequate handling of failed operations"
    ],
    "impact": "Files normally protected by security constraints may become accessible without authentication",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious WAR file with files that, when deployed, will bypass security constraints.",
	  "Cause a failed undeploy operation, which leaves files unprotected."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "Ability to deploy applications, typically through a management interface"
  },
   "affectedConfigurations": [
      "Apache Tomcat 5.5.x",
