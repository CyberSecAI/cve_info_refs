| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=514957#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-07-31 16:22:16 UTC  ``` Core Security Technologies reported that previous upstream fixes addressing insufficient input validation flaw in pidgin / libpurple in function msn_slplink_process_msg() are inefficient and can be bypassed.  This flaw allows an attacker to overwrite pidgin's memory and possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running application using libpurple.  This issue was previously tracked as [CVE-2008-2927](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-2927) ([bug #453764](show_bug.cgi?id=453764 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-2927 pidgin MSN integer overflow")) and [CVE-2009-1376](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1376) ([bug #500493](show_bug.cgi?id=500493 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-1376 pidgin incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2927"), incomplete fix).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=514957#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2009-08-13 12:31:56 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Users can lower the impact of this flaw by making sure their privacy settings only allow Pidgin to accept messages from the users on their buddy list.  This will prevent exploitation of this flaw by other random MSN users.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=514957#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2009-08-13 12:39:01 UTC  ``` Technically, this is not really an incomplete fix of the previous integer overflow issues, rather a new issue affecting same code part as previous issues.  In the new attack, attacker aims to exploit a NULL pointer dereference flaw.  This is achieved by sending message with non-0 offset.  When such message is processed in msn_slplink_process_msg(), msn_slplink_message_find() is called to find previous parts of the message sent within the same session.  With specially crafted previous messages, msn_slplink_message_find() may return a structure for ACK message, rather than request message, that later triggers NULL pointer dereference in:    memcpy(slpmsg->buffer + offset, data, len);  In ACK message, slpmsg->buffer is NULL and attacker supplied offset can be used to control what memory area will be overwritten.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=514957#c7)  Josh Bressers    2009-08-18 17:21:56 UTC  ``` This is now public: <http://developer.pidgin.im/viewmtn/revision/info/6f7343166c673bf0496ecb1afec9b633c1d54a0e>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=514957#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-18 18:00:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1218 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1218.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=514957#c9)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-08-21 08:58:49 UTC  ``` MITRE's [CVE-2009-2694](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-2694) record: -----------------------------  The msn_slplink_process_msg function in libpurple/protocols/msn/slplink.c in libpurple, as used in Pidgin (formerly Gaim) before 2.5.9 and Adium 1.3.5 and earlier, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) by sending multiple crafted SLP (aka MSNSLP) messages to trigger an overwrite of an arbitrary memory location. NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2009-1376](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1376).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Topic

Updated pidgin packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Pidgin is an instant messaging program which can log in to multiple
accounts on multiple instant messaging networks simultaneously.

Federico Muttis of Core Security Technologies discovered a flaw in Pidgin's
MSN protocol handler. If a user received a malicious MSN message, it was
possible to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
Pidgin. (CVE-2009-2694)

Note: Users can change their privacy settings to only allow messages from
users on their buddy list to limit the impact of this flaw.

These packages upgrade Pidgin to version 2.5.9. Refer to the Pidgin release
notes for a full list of changes: <http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ChangeLog>

All Pidgin users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve
this issue. Pidgin must be restarted for this update to take effect.

Package        : pidgin
Vulnerability  : insufficient input validation
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-2694

Federico Muttis discovered that libpurple, the shared library that adds
support for various instant messaging networks to the pidgin IM client, is
vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow.  This issue exists because of
an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2927 and CVE-2009-1376.  An attacker can
exploit this by sending two consecutive SLP packets to a victim via MSN.

The first packet is used to create an SLP message object with an offset of
zero, the second packet then contains a crafted offset which hits the
vulnerable code originally fixed in CVE-2008-2927 and CVE-2009-1376 and
allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Note: Users with the "Allow only the users below" setting are not vulnerable
      to this attack. If you can't install the below updates you may want to
      set this via Tools->Privacy.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.3-4lenny3.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=514957#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-07-31 16:22:16 UTC  ``` Core Security Technologies reported that previous upstream fixes addressing insufficient input validation flaw in pidgin / libpurple in function msn_slplink_process_msg() are inefficient and can be bypassed.  This flaw allows an attacker to overwrite pidgin's memory and possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running application using libpurple.  This issue was previously tracked as [CVE-2008-2927](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-2927) ([bug #453764](show_bug.cgi?id=453764 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2008-2927 pidgin MSN integer overflow")) and [CVE-2009-1376](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1376) ([bug #500493](show_bug.cgi?id=500493 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2009-1376 pidgin incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2927"), incomplete fix).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=514957#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2009-08-13 12:31:56 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Users can lower the impact of this flaw by making sure their privacy settings only allow Pidgin to accept messages from the users on their buddy list.  This will prevent exploitation of this flaw by other random MSN users.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=514957#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2009-08-13 12:39:01 UTC  ``` Technically, this is not really an incomplete fix of the previous integer overflow issues, rather a new issue affecting same code part as previous issues.  In the new attack, attacker aims to exploit a NULL pointer dereference flaw.  This is achieved by sending message with non-0 offset.  When such message is processed in msn_slplink_process_msg(), msn_slplink_message_find() is called to find previous parts of the message sent within the same session.  With specially crafted previous messages, msn_slplink_message_find() may return a structure for ACK message, rather than request message, that later triggers NULL pointer dereference in:    memcpy(slpmsg->buffer + offset, data, len);  In ACK message, slpmsg->buffer is NULL and attacker supplied offset can be used to control what memory area will be overwritten.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=514957#c7)  Josh Bressers    2009-08-18 17:21:56 UTC  ``` This is now public: <http://developer.pidgin.im/viewmtn/revision/info/6f7343166c673bf0496ecb1afec9b633c1d54a0e>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=514957#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-18 18:00:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1218 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1218.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=514957#c9)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-08-21 08:58:49 UTC  ``` MITRE's [CVE-2009-2694](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-2694) record: -----------------------------  The msn_slplink_process_msg function in libpurple/protocols/msn/slplink.c in libpurple, as used in Pidgin (formerly Gaim) before 2.5.9 and Adium 1.3.5 and earlier, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) by sending multiple crafted SLP (aka MSNSLP) messages to trigger an overwrite of an arbitrary memory location. NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2009-1376](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1376).
