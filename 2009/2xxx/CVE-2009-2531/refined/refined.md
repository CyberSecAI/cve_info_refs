{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the way Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, or creating new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker would need to host a specially crafted webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker would then need to convince the user to visit the malicious webpage. This could be achieved through links in emails, instant messages, or compromised websites. It could also be possible to display the malicious content using banner advertisements."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious webpage. The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious webpage using Internet Explorer.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability requires a user to be logged in and visiting the malicious website for the exploit to occur. Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk."
