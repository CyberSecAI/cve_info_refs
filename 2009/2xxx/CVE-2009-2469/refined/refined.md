{
  "CVE-2009-2469": {
    "Description": "A crash involving a SVG element on which a watch function and __defineSetter__ function have been set for a particular property. The crash showed evidence of memory corruption and could potentially be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how JavaScript's `watch` and `__defineSetter__` functions interact with SVG elements. When a `watch` function is set on an SVG element's property, and then `__defineSetter__` is used to define a setter for the same property, the watchpoint's setter isn't properly updated. This leads to a situation where the watchpoint calls a native setter function but interprets it as a JS function object, leading to a crash due to memory corruption.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption due to incorrect function pointer usage.",
      "Improper handling of watchpoints when setters are redefined.",
       "Reinterpreting a pointer to GC-allocated function object as a pointer to the native code."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code on a victim's computer.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted web page containing a malicious SVG element using the watch and defineSetter functions."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious webpage crafted with the described SVG and JavaScript. The attacker would likely need a web server to host the malicious page."
