    "ID": "CVE-2009-2148",
    "Content": "The provided content indicates that CVE-2009-2148 is associated with multiple vulnerabilities found in 'campus virtual-lms'. These include SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).\n\n**SQL Injection:**\n*   **Root cause:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization when processing the 'id' parameter within the 'news/index.php' file.\n*   **Attack vector:** By manipulating the 'id' parameter in a GET request.\n*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation leading to SQL injection vulnerability.\n*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database or modify data, depending on the database user privileges.\n*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**\n*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing certain parameters in different files, resulting in XSS vulnerabilities.\n*   **Attack vector:** By injecting malicious script code via GET or POST parameters:\n    *   'courseid' parameter in 'enrolments/step1.php' (no login required)\n    *   'search' parameter in 'files/shared_list.php' (login required, POST/GET)\n    *  'siteid' parameter in 'files/shared_list.php' (login required, GET)\n*   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding or input validation for user-controlled data, leading to XSS vulnerability.\n*   **Impact:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or performing actions on their behalf.\n*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to lure the victim into accessing the crafted URL. Some XSS vulnerabilities may require user login while others do not.\n\n**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**\n*   **Root cause:** The application does not properly implement CSRF protections.\n*   **Attack vector:** By tricking a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or loading a crafted image to log out or add/delete courses.  \n*  **Weakness:** Missing CSRF tokens, lack of proper user validation.\n*   **Impact:**  An attacker can force logged in users to perform state changing actions such as logging out, or adding/deleting courses. The attacker would need knowledge of the user's 'oderid' for the course adding/deleting function, making that particular CSRF vector less exploitable.\n*   **Attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into accessing the malicious link. \n\n**Additional Notes:**\n* The provided content is more detailed than a typical CVE description. It specifies the affected files and parameters.\n*The content also mentions a less exploitable CSRF vulnerability because it requires prior knowledge of a userâ€™s order ID.\n*The application is 'Campus Virtual-LMS' and the vulnerabilities were reported on June 12, 2009."
