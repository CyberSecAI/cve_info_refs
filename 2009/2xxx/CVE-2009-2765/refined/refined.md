Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the DD-WRT's `httpd` server when handling URLs containing "cgi-bin". Specifically, the `httpd` server doesn't properly handle metacharacters in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Command Injection:** The `httpd` server constructs a shell command using unsanitized user-supplied input from the URL path. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
2.  **Missing Authentication Check:** The server executes the injected commands even if the user is not authenticated. Although output is not shown to an unauthenticated user, the commands are still executed.
3.  **Privilege Escalation:** The `httpd` server runs as root, meaning injected commands also execute with root privileges.
4.  **CSRF Vulnerability:** Exploitation can be achieved via Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. This allows an attacker to trigger the vulnerability by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website or loading a crafted image link, potentially without the user even having an authenticated session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Root Access:** An attacker can gain complete control of the vulnerable device by executing arbitrary commands with root privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Attackers can potentially use this access to install malware, create backdoors, steal data, or use the device in botnets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers can craft URLs containing injected commands and directly access the router's web interface, e.g., `http://routerIP/cgi-bin/;command_to_execute`.
*   **CSRF:** Attackers can embed malicious URLs in web pages or images that, when loaded by a user on the same network as the vulnerable router, trigger the command injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the router's web interface. This could be via the local network or, if remote administration is enabled, from the internet.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `httpd` server, which runs as root.
*   The issue can be exploited using shell metacharacters in the URL, such as `nc$IFS-l$IFS-p$IFS\5555$IFS-e$IFS/bin/sh` to open a reverse shell.
*   The vulnerability is present in DD-WRT firmware versions up to and including the latest 24 sp1 version.
*   A temporary fix involves adding a firewall rule to block access to URLs containing "cgi-bin".
*   A permanent fix involves updating to a patched version of the firmware.
*   The vulnerability is described as "embarrassing" and "weird" due to its simplicity and the fact that such vulnerabilities were uncommon by 2009.
*   The vulnerability was initially reported on milw0rm.com, now Exploit Database.
