  "CVE-2009-2530": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory access",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote code execution, granting the attacker the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could host a specially crafted webpage or use compromised websites and websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.  The attacker would have to convince users to visit the malicious website.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage or inject malicious code into a webpage, and then convince a victim to visit it.  No special privileges are required on the targeted system."
