| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=522141#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-09-09 15:11:16 UTC  ``` OpenSSH version 4.8 introduced support for ChrootDirectory configuration option, which allows chrooting of users after successful authentication to a specified directory:    <http://openssh.org/txt/release-4.8>  sshd requires strict permissions of the chroot directory and all parent directories, as detailed in the manual pages:    sshd_config(5)    This path, and all its components, must be root-owned directories that   are not writable by any other user or group.    <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&sektion=5>  OpenSSH version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (backport of ChrootDirectory was added in 5.4) and Fedora 11 (only testing, at the moment) relaxed this check to allow directories to be owned by the user logging in, to make ChrootDirectory %h setting work more "as expected".  However, it was discovered that this change makes system more vulnerable to attacks using mis-configured chroot directory trees.  Possible attack requires user to be able to create hard links to setuid programs installed on the system out of the chroot.  This actually consists of two requirements:  - user must have non-chroot-ed shell access to the system (e.g. local console access, or do the setup of the chroot directory before ChrootDirectory is enabled for the user)  - target setuid program must be located on the same file system as user's home directory  If the behaviour of the target setuid program is controlled by some configuration file (e.g. PAM configuration files, library), it may use attacker-controlled file instead of the administrator-controlled one and allow user to escalate privileges, when program is executed inside of the chroot.  Other attack vectors may be possible.  Upstream bugreport proposing upstream inclusion of the fix:   <https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1593>   (with upstream stating this is a bad idea)  Article describing the use of ChrootDirectory:   <http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20080220110039>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=522141#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-09-16 14:09:25 UTC  ``` Links to few older discussions on ChrootDirectory security checks on the upstream openssh-unix-dev mailinglist:  <https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2009-March/027491.html> <https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2008-November/026981.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=522141#c3)  Mark J.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2009:1470 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openssh security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1470)

## Topic

Updated openssh packages that fix a security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

OpenSSH is OpenBSD's SSH (Secure Shell) protocol implementation. These
packages include the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH client and
server.

A Red Hat specific patch used in the openssh packages as shipped in Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 (RHSA-2009:1287) loosened certain ownership
requirements for directories used as arguments for the ChrootDirectory
configuration options. A malicious user that also has or previously had
non-chroot shell access to a system could possibly use this flaw to
escalate their privileges and run commands as any system user.
(CVE-2009-2904)

All OpenSSH users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this
update, the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd) will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=522141#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-09-09 15:11:16 UTC  ``` OpenSSH version 4.8 introduced support for ChrootDirectory configuration option, which allows chrooting of users after successful authentication to a specified directory:    <http://openssh.org/txt/release-4.8>  sshd requires strict permissions of the chroot directory and all parent directories, as detailed in the manual pages:    sshd_config(5)    This path, and all its components, must be root-owned directories that   are not writable by any other user or group.    <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sshd_config&sektion=5>  OpenSSH version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (backport of ChrootDirectory was added in 5.4) and Fedora 11 (only testing, at the moment) relaxed this check to allow directories to be owned by the user logging in, to make ChrootDirectory %h setting work more "as expected".  However, it was discovered that this change makes system more vulnerable to attacks using mis-configured chroot directory trees.  Possible attack requires user to be able to create hard links to setuid programs installed on the system out of the chroot.  This actually consists of two requirements:  - user must have non-chroot-ed shell access to the system (e.g. local console access, or do the setup of the chroot directory before ChrootDirectory is enabled for the user)  - target setuid program must be located on the same file system as user's home directory  If the behaviour of the target setuid program is controlled by some configuration file (e.g. PAM configuration files, library), it may use attacker-controlled file instead of the administrator-controlled one and allow user to escalate privileges, when program is executed inside of the chroot.  Other attack vectors may be possible.  Upstream bugreport proposing upstream inclusion of the fix:   <https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1593>   (with upstream stating this is a bad idea)  Article describing the use of ChrootDirectory:   <http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20080220110039>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=522141#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-09-16 14:09:25 UTC  ``` Links to few older discussions on ChrootDirectory security checks on the upstream openssh-unix-dev mailinglist:  <https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2009-March/027491.html> <https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2008-November/026981.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=522141#c3)  Mark J. Cox    2009-09-30 15:02:25 UTC  ``` Removing embargo, making public   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=522141#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-09-30 15:11:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1470 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1470.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=522141#c6)  Fedora Update System    2010-03-29 06:41:45 UTC  ``` openssh-5.2p1-6.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/openssh-5.2p1-6.fc11>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=522141#c7)  Fedora Update System    2010-03-30 02:17:40 UTC  ``` openssh-5.2p1-6.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.
