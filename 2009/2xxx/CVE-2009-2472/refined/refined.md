  "CVE-2009-2472": {
    "description": "Mozilla security researcher moz_bug_r_a4 reported a series of vulnerabilities in which objects that normally receive a XPCCrossOriginWrapper are constructed without the wrapper. This can lead to cases where JavaScript from one website may unsafely access properties of such an object which had been set by a different website. A malicious website could use this vulnerability to launch a XSS attack and run arbitrary JavaScript within the context of another site.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Objects that should receive an XPCCrossOriginWrapper were being constructed without it.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing XPCCrossOriginWrapper leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)."
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious website could bypass the Same Origin Policy and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing it to run arbitrary JavaScript within the context of another site.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Accessing properties of objects that did not receive the proper wrapper.",
         "Using a shallow XPCNativeWrapper and a numeric property",
         "Accessing a window by using |this|, __parent__ property or valueOf.call()"

      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a malicious website that can influence the vulnerable browser."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.12"
    ],
    "patch_information": "The vulnerability was fixed in Mozilla Firefox 3.0.12 and 3.5."
