- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a blind SQL injection flaw in the `id` parameter of the `com_aclassf` component for Joomla.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SQL Injection. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database by using SQL injection techniques to query the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable application, specifically targeting the `id` parameter within the `com_aclassf` component URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application. No authentication is required. The attacker can be remote.
