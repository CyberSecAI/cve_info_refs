Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-2628:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the VMware VMnc video codec (vmnc.dll). This codec is used to play back movies recorded with VMware Workstation, Player, and ACE.
*   The core issue is that the VMnc decoder improperly handles video content with a specified height of less than 8 pixels within AVI files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The incorrect handling of the image height leads to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful exploit can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **System compromise:** This could lead to full control of the system by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious AVI files:** Attackers can exploit this by creating specially crafted AVI files with malicious height parameters.
*   **User interaction:** The user needs to be tricked into opening a malicious video file or visiting a malicious webpage.
*   **Multiple avenues of attack:** This can happen in several ways, including:
    *   Playing an AVI file via Windows Media Player.
    *   Viewing a web page that uses the Windows Media Player ActiveX control or plugin.
    *   Simply selecting an AVI file in Windows Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, unauthenticated access:** The attacker can be remote and does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious web page.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `vmnc.dll` file, which contains the VMnc decoder.
*   The vulnerability can be reached via Windows applications that support the DirectShow API.
*   The issue is resolved in VMware Movie Decoder 6.5.3, Workstation 6.5.3, Player 6.5.3, and ACE 2.5.3.

**CVE Details:**

*   The CVE entry for CVE-2009-2628 is associated with the vulnerability described.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Update to patched versions:** Applying the updates provided by VMware resolves the issue.
*   **Remove the VMnc codec:** Removing the `vmnc.dll` file mitigates the vulnerability but disables playback of VMnc codec AVI files.
