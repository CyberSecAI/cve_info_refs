How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## VMware VMnc AVI video codec image height heap overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#444513

Original Release Date: 2009-09-05 | Last Revised: 2012-03-28

---

### Overview

The VMware VMnc video codec fails to properly handle the image height value in AVI files, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Several VMware products include the ability to create and play movies of running virtual machines. The codec used in these movies is called VMnc, which is based on the VNC RFB protocol. The VMnc decoder is provided by the file vmnc.dll. The VMnc codec fails to properly handle video content with a specified height of less than 8 pixels. This flaw can lead to heap memory corruption. The vulnerable code in vmnc.dll may be reached via Windows applications that supports the [DirectShow](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd375454%28VS.85%29.aspx) API. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to parse a specially crafted VMnc codec AVI file, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. This may occur as the result of several actions, including playing an AVI file with Windows Media Player, viewing a web page that uses the Windows Media Player ActiveX control or plug-in, or even simply by selecting an AVI file in Windows Explorer. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is addressed in VMware Movie Decoder 6.5.3, Workstation 6.5.3, Player 6.5.3, and ACE 2.5.3. Details for obtaining these versions are available in VMware Security Advisory [VMSA-2009-0012](http://lists.vmware.com/pipermail/security-announce/2009/000065.html). |

VMware Security Advisory Advisory ID:VMSA-2009-0012VMware Security Advisory Synopsis:VMware Movie Decoder, VMware Workstation, VMware Player, and VMware ACE resolve security issues.VMware Security Advisory Issue date:2009-09-04VMware Security Advisory Updated on:2009-09-04 (initial release of advisory)VMware Security Advisory CVE numbers:CVE-2009-0199 CVE-2009-2628
##### 1. Summary

Several security issues are resolved with the latest VMnc codec.

##### 2. Relevant releases

VMware Workstation Movie Decoder stand alone 6.5.2 and earlier.
VMware Workstation 6.5.2 and earlier,
VMware Player 2.5.2 and earlier,
VMware ACE 2.5.2 and earlier,

##### 3. Problem Description

Several security issues resolved with the latest VMnc codec.
The VMware movie decoder contains the VMnc media codec that is
required to play back movies recorded with VMware Workstation,
VMware Player and VMware ACE, in any compatible media player. The
movie decoder is installed as part of VMware Workstation, VMware
Player and VMware ACE, or can be downloaded as a stand alone
package.
Several vulnerabilities in the VMnc codec can be exploited to cause
heap-based buffer overflows via specially crafted video files
containing incorrect framebuffer parameters.
For an attack to be successful the user must be tricked into
visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious video file on
a system that has the vulnerable version of the VMnc codec installed.
VMware would like to thank Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research and
Will Dormann of the CERT/CC for reporting these issues and working
with us on their remediation.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-0199 and CVE-2009-2628 to these
issues.
To remediate the above issues either install the stand alone movie
decoder or update your product using the table below.
