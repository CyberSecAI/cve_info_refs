- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `rid` parameter within the `viewrecords` request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access (reading usernames, passwords, emails from the `md_users` table), data modification, or complete database takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed through a web interface (`modules.php`) where the `rid` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability, as it is exposed through the web application.
