RHSA-2009:1540 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2009-11-03
Updated:
2009-11-03
# RHSA-2009:1540 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel-rt security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated kernel-rt packages that fix several security issues, multiple bugs,
and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.1.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* the ADDR\_COMPAT\_LAYOUT and MMAP\_PAGE\_ZERO flags were not cleared when a

setuid or setgid program was executed. A local, unprivileged user could use
this flaw to bypass the mmap\_min\_addr protection mechanism and perform a
NULL pointer dereference attack, or bypass the Address Space Layout
Randomization (ASLR) security feature. (CVE-2009-1895, Important)

* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local

users in the unconfined\_t domain to map low memory areas even if the
mmap\_min\_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local
exploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in getname() implementations in

numerous network protocol implementations in the Linux kernel. Certain
data structures in these getname() implementations were not initialized
properly before being copied to user-space. These flaws could lead to an
information leak. (CVE-2009-3002, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux

kernel. pci\_unmap\_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
abuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.
(CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in the r128 driver in the

Linux kernel. Checks to test if the Concurrent Command Engine state was
initialized were missing in private IOCTL functions. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a local denial of service or escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2009-3620, Important)

* Kees Cook and Steve Beattie discovered a race condition in the /proc

code in the Linux kernel. This could lead to information in the
"/proc/[pid]/maps" and "/proc/[pid]/smaps" files being leaked to users (who
would otherwise not have access to this information) during ELF loading.
This could help a local attacker bypass the ASLR security feature.
(CVE-2009-2691, Moderate)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the md driver in the Linux

kernel. If the suspend\_lo or suspend\_hi file in "/sys/" is modified when
the disk array is inactive, it could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. By default, only root can write to these two files.
(CVE-2009-2849, Moderate)

* an information leak was found in the Linux kernel. On AMD64 systems,

32-bit processes could access and read certain 64-bit registers by
temporarily switching themselves to 64-bit mode. (CVE-2009-2910, Moderate)

* padding data in several core network structures was not initialized

properly before being sent to user-space, possibly leading to information
leaks. (CVE-2009-3228, CVE-2009-3612, Moderate)

* the unix\_stream\_connect() function in the Linux kernel did not check if a

UNIX domain socket was in the shutdown state. This could lead to a
deadlock. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial
of service. (CVE-2009-3621, Moderate)

These updated packages also include bug fixes and enhancements. Users are
directed to the Realtime Security Update Release Notes for version 1.1 for
information on these changes, which will be available shortly from:

<http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_MRG/>

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues and add enhancements. The system must be
rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

Note that the default permission for this sysfs file is 644. It can be
triggered if you are a local privileged user.

Subject: md raid null ptr dereference (when sysfs is writable)

Hi,

<http://xorl.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/linux-kernel-md-driver-null-pointer-dereference/>

2.6.30 stable:
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.30.y.git;a=commit;h=3c92900d9a4afb176d3de335dc0da0198660a244>
mainline:
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=b8d966efd9a46a9a35beac50cbff6e30565125ef>

While not directly exploitable, its just needs write access to the sysfs files
to get exploited, so I guess this warrants a CVE number.

Ciao, Marcus

## Details

Solar Designer discovered that the z90crypt driver did not correctly

check capabilities. A local attacker could exploit this to shut down

the device, leading to a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06.

([CVE-2009-1883](/security/CVE-2009-1883))

Michael Buesch discovered that the SGI GRU driver did not correctly check

the length when setting options. A local attacker could exploit this

to write to the kernel stack, leading to root privilege escalation or

a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2584](/security/CVE-2009-2584))

It was discovered that SELinux did not fully implement the mmap\_min\_addr

restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to allocate the

NULL memory page which could lead to further attacks against kernel

NULL-dereference vulnerabilities. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected.

([CVE-2009-2695](/security/CVE-2009-2695))

Cagri Coltekin discovered that the UDP stack did not correctly handle

certain flags. A local user could send specially crafted commands and

traffic to gain root privileges or crash the systeam, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06. ([CVE-2009-2698](/security/CVE-2009-2698))

Hiroshi Shimamoto discovered that monotonic timers did not correctly

validate parameters. A local user could make a specially crafted timer

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2767](/security/CVE-2009-2767))

Michael Buesch discovered that the HPPA ISA EEPROM driver did not

correctly validate positions. A local user could make a specially crafted

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2846](/security/CVE-2009-2846))

Ulrich Drepper discovered that kernel signal stacks were not being

correctly padded on 64-bit systems. A local attacker could send specially

crafted calls to expose 4 bytes of kernel stack memory, leading to a

loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-2847](/security/CVE-2009-2847))

Jens Rosenboom discovered that the clone method did not correctly clear

certain fields. A local attacker could exploit this to gain privileges

or crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-2848](/security/CVE-2009-2848))

It was discovered that the MD driver did not check certain sysfs files.

A local attacker with write access to /sys could exploit this to cause

a system crash, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 6.06 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-2849](/security/CVE-2009-2849))

Mark Smith discovered that the AppleTalk stack did not correctly

manage memory. A remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic

to cause the system to consume all available memory, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2903](/security/CVE-2009-2903))

Loïc Minier discovered that eCryptfs did not correctly handle writing

to certain deleted files. A local attacker could exploit this to gain

root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-2908](/security/CVE-2009-2908))

It was discovered that the LLC, AppleTalk, IR, EConet, Netrom, and

ROSE network stacks did not correctly initialize their data structures.

A local attacker could make specially crafted calls to read kernel memory,

leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3001](/security/CVE-2009-3001), [CVE-2009-3002](/security/CVE-2009-3002))

It was discovered that the randomization used for Address Space Layout

Randomization was predictable within a small window of time. A local

attacker could exploit this to leverage further attacks that require

knowledge of userspace memory layouts. ([CVE-2009-3238](/security/CVE-2009-3238))

Eric Paris discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly handle file creation

failures. An attacker with write access to an NFSv4 share could exploit

this to create files with arbitrary mode bits, leading to privilege

escalation or a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3286](/security/CVE-2009-3286))

Bob Tracy discovered that the SCSI generic driver did not correctly use

the right index for array access. A local attacker with write access

to a CDR could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 9.04 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3288](/security/CVE-2009-3288))

Jan Kiszka discovered that KVM did not correctly validate certain

hypercalls. A local unprivileged attacker in a virtual guest could exploit

this to crash the guest kernel, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu

6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3290](/security/CVE-2009-3290))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=517830#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-08-17 12:28:34 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Dan Walsh's blog post mentioned in the previous comment details selinux-policy part of the issue tracked via [bug #512284](show_bug.cgi?id=512284 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2009-1897 kernel: tun/tap: Fix crashes if open() /dev/net/tun and then poll() it").  As noted in the the blog, selinux-policy provides a boolean - allow_unconfined_mmap_low - which controls whether mmap_min_addr restriction is applied to the process.  This boolean, however, did not work as expected, as unconfined_t domain (default domain for logged-in unprivileged users) was always permitted to map low memory pages regardless of the boolean setting.  This problem with the boolean is being fixed and the fix will be included in future selinux-policy updates in RHEL5 and Fedora (see Dan's blog for NVRs).  Few notes specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5: Support for mmap_min_addr sysctl was not included in the GA version of RHEL5.  It was only added in kernel update in 5.2 (it first appeared upstream in 2.6.24).  selinux-policy was, to avoid breaking applications needing low memory pages mapping on upgrade from 5.1 to 5.2, configured to allow mmap_zero in unconfined domains and only disallow it in confined domains (e.g. various network facing services).  In 5.3, allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean was added, but it's default value for targeted policy was changed to on, i.e. allowing mmap_zero in all unconfined domains by default.  This default boolean value is planned to remain unchanged in 5.4.  It should also be noted, that even with allow_unconfined_mmap_low boolean set to off, it is still possible for unconfined_t user to transition to other domain that is permitted to mmap_zero, as details in the Dan's blog post.  Upstream discussion on how to best address this issue is still ongoing.  Eric's proposed patches moving mmap_min_addr check out of security were submitted.  If they are accepted upstream, mmap_min_addr will be checked before LSM hooks are called.  Security modules will only be consulted if mmap_min_addr check has passed (e.g. when mmap_min_addr is 0), so SELinux may still be able to restrict mapping of the low pages / zero page for confined domains and permit mapping in unconfined, even when mmap_min_addr is 0.  Eric's patches with further discussion: <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36540/> <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36539/>  Updated version: <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36650/> <http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36649/>  Further discussion of the proposed change: <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.lsm/9075>  mmap_min_addr on SELinux and non-SELinux systems <http://eparis.livejournal.com/606.html>  Confining the unconfined.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

It booted further then it had before, but I got the following hang: Calgary: DMA error on CalIOC2 PHB 0x3 Calgary: 0x02000000@CSR 0x00008000@PLSSR 0xb0008000@CSMR 0x00000000@MCK Calgary: 0x00000000@0x810 0xf6850000@0x820 0xf6850000@0x830 0x00000000@0x840 0x06000000@0x850 0x00000000@0x860 0x00000000@0x870                                  Calgary: 0x48000000@0xcb0   Booting with calgary=disable didn't seem to do anything either.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=518160#c4)  IBM Bug Proxy    2009-08-19 22:10:45 UTC  ``` ------- Comment From johnstul.com 2009-08-19 18:05 EDT------- Booting with iommu=soft got me a little further, now I've hit the following:  audit(1250693650.914:2): enforcing=1 old_enforcing=0 auid=4294967295 Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!

So this ends up being a very unhelpful message. After lots of brute forcing options, I found that there was a selinux related error being printed to the console. Rebooting w/ selinux=off made the box boot further, but still had lots of error messages due to the disk being read-only.  Ends up that since this is a multi-node system, there are *two* sets of disks that have the "/" partition label. This confuses selinux and causes the problem.  So after correcting the partition label issue, I was able to boot 2.6.24.7-126.el5rt by adding iommu=soft  ------- Comment From johnstul.com 2009-08-20 21:23 EDT------- To avoid the need for iommu=soft, disabling CALGARY_IOMMU_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT would be needed.  Clark: Do you think that config change could be made?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=518160#c8)  IBM Bug Proxy    2009-10-09 15:51:17 UTC  ``` ------- Comment From sripathik.com 2009-10-09 11:45 EDT------- CONFIG_CALGARY_IOMMU_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT is not set in 2.6.31.2-rt13.21.el5rt.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=518160#c9)  IBM Bug Proxy    2009-10-14 05:31:24 UTC  ``` ------- Comment From sripathik.com 2009-10-14 01:25 EDT------- In 2.6.31-rc5.3.el5rt CONFIG_CALGARY_IOMMU_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT=y In 2.6.31-rt10.18.el5rt CONFIG_CALGARY_IOMMU_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT is not set In 2.6.31.2-rt13.21.el5rt CONFIG_CALGARY_IOMMU_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT is not set  So looks like the problem has been fixed in recent kernels.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Linux kernel MD Driver NULL Pointer Dereference

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/linux-kernel-md-driver-null-pointer-dereference/#respond)

I was having a look at [2.6.30.2’s ChangeLog](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.30.2) and noticed [this one](http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.30.2). The bug is easy to understand, here is one of the buggy functions from 2.6.30’s drivers/md/md.c:

```

static ssize_t
suspend_lo_store(mddev_t *mddev, const char *buf, size_t len)
{
        char *e;
        unsigned long long new = simple_strtoull(buf, &e, 10);

        if (mddev->pers->quiesce == NULL)
                return -EINVAL;
        if (buf == e || (*e && *e != '\n'))
                return -EINVAL;
        if (new >= mddev->suspend_hi ||
            (new > mddev->suspend_lo && new < mddev->suspend_hi)) {
                mddev->suspend_lo = new;
                mddev->pers->quiesce(mddev, 2);
                return len;
        } else
                return -EINVAL;
}
static struct md_sysfs_entry md_suspend_lo =
__ATTR(suspend_lo, S_IRUGO|S_IWUSR, suspend_lo_show, suspend_lo_store);

```

As you can easily deduce from the two last lines, this can be reached through /sys/block/mdX/md/suspend\_lo sysfs file. Of course as you can see that its default mode is 0644 and that might make this non-exploitable unless some distribution has different mode. Anyhow, the first if condition checks that mddev->pers->quiesce is not NULL. However, if the array is not active, then mddev->pers which is an mdk\_personality structure describing the device and it includes numerous function pointers, could be NULL. In this case, the first if will be bypassed since mddev->pers->quiesce will definitely not going to be NULL, it will be NULL + the offset until quiesce which is just a void \* if we have a look at the equivalent structure in drivers/md/md.h. This can result in a NULL pointer dereference or if it isn’t triggered by that time, then it will be triggered when mddev function pointer of mddev->pers->quiesce is called.

This was patched by adding the missing check.

```

        unsigned long long new = simple_strtoull(buf, &e, 10);

-      if (mddev->pers->quiesce == NULL)
+      if (mddev->pers == NULL ||
+          mddev->pers->quiesce == NULL)
               return -EINVAL;

```

And the exact same vulnerability was also present in suspend\_hi\_store() of the same file.
