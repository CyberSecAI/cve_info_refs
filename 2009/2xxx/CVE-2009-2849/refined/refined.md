{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The md driver in the Linux kernel does not check if the disk array is active before allowing modifications to the 'suspend_lo' or 'suspend_hi' files in '/sys/'. If the array is inactive, the mddev->pers pointer can be NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when the mddev->pers->quiesce function pointer is accessed or called.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Missing input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Local denial of service or privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the filesystem with write permissions to '/sys/block/mdX/md/suspend_lo' or '/sys/block/mdX/md/suspend_hi' where 'mdX' represents the md device."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A local user needs write access to the aforementioned sysfs files, which is not granted by default.",
