        "attack_vectors": "The attacker must be able to place a specially crafted application on a system or network share.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to place a specially crafted application on the target system, either directly or via a network share, and have a user browse to the location of the application for exploitation to occur. The user does not need to execute the application. Local logon is not a requirement for exploitation."
