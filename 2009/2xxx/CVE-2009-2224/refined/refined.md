- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) in the AN Guestbook application. The application includes a language file based on user-provided input without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  **Unsanitized Input:** The `$g_lang` variable, likely derived from user input, is used directly to include a file.
    -  **Local File Inclusion:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files by manipulating the `$g_lang` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server where AN Guestbook is hosted. This can potentially reveal sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `$g_lang` parameter, an attacker can include arbitrary files in the server's filesystem.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input that determines the `$g_lang` variable. This is likely through a GET/POST parameter.
