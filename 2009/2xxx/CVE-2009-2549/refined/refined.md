Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-2549

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how the game servers (Armed Assault/ArmA, ArmA 2, Operation Flashpoint, and VBS series) handle the last field of the join packet, which appears to be a datafile ID.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of specific values (0 or 1) in this data field.
    *   Setting this field to '1' often results in immediate server termination due to a memory allocation error.
    *   Setting this field to '0', when used by at least two players, triggers resource consumption (CPU at 100% and memory issues) in ArmA, a NULL pointer dereference in ArmA 2, or similar effects.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) of the game server, crashing it or making it unresponsive
    *   Resource exhaustion on the server, preventing legitimate players from playing
    *   Potential for other unexpected server behavior like crashes, hangs, etc
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote exploitation through malicious join packets sent to vulnerable game servers.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the server.
    *   If the server is password protected, the attacker needs to know the password.

**Affected Products:**

*   Armed Assault (ArmA) <= 1.14 (beta 1.16 is also vulnerable)
*   ArmA 2 <= 1.04
*   Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis <= 1.46
*   Operation Flashpoint: Resistance <= 1.96
*   VBS1 <= 1.99
*   VBS2 <= 1.3

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit code (armazzo.zip) was available at the provided URL.
*   The report mentions a Linux server for ArmA which is likely vulnerable.
*   No official fix is described in the provided content, but the content mentions an update to ArmA2 1.07. This could be a patch but is not specified.
