{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure cookie handling.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application does not properly validate or sanitize cookie data, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary values.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can set a cookie with a malicious username, potentially gaining unauthorized access or manipulating user data. Specifically, the provided exploit suggests it allows bypassing authentication by setting a crafted 'kulladi' cookie.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the manipulation of the 'kulladi' cookie via javascript. The attacker injects javascript code to set the cookie value.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute javascript on the client side, typically by injecting it in a context the user will trigger, such as through a crafted link or another XSS vulnerability in the application. The attacker needs to know the name of the cookie being used for authentication purposes, 'kulladi'."
