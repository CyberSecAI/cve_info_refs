Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2009-2626:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A flaw in the `ini_restore()` function within PHP.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Memory disclosure.
*   Potential for a PHP crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Disclosure of sensitive data by revealing memory contents.
*   Denial of service due to a potential crash.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by using `ini_set` to declare a variable, and then `ini_restore` to restore it. This requires the attacker to control the PHP script or have the ability to influence its execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute or influence the execution of a PHP script where `ini_set` and then `ini_restore` are used on the same variable. This could be achieved through various means:
    *   Directly injecting malicious code.
    *   Manipulating input to cause the execution of malicious code within a vulnerable script.
    *   Exploiting another vulnerability that allows them to run arbitrary PHP code.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue is present in PHP versions up to and including 5.2.10 and 5.3.0.
*   The fix requires backporting changes from upstream.
*   The vulnerability exists in the `zend_restore_ini_entry_cb` function in `zend_ini.c`.
*   The fix prevents memory leaks and null pointer dereferences by avoiding comparing null values during ini restore.
*   The vulnerability was deemed too risky to fix in the 'etch' distribution.
