{
  "Root cause": "The `mkfs.nilfs2` utility, part of the nilfs-utils package, was installed as setuid root and used the `system()` function to execute external commands. This allowed for privilege escalation.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "The use of `system()` to execute external commands without proper sanitization.",
    "Installation of binaries as setuid root when not necessary."
  ],
  "Impact": "Privilege escalation, allowing a normal user to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "By exploiting the vulnerable `mkfs.nilfs2` utility through the execution of carefully crafted external commands.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "A normal user with the ability to execute `mkfs.nilfs2`."
