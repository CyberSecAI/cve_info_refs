- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Android improperly checks permissions when applications access the camera and audio resources. Specifically, if an application does not explicitly request the `Manifest.permission.CAMERA` or `Manifest.permission.AUDIO_RECORD` permissions, it is still implicitly allowed to use the device camera and/or microphone.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper permission check, leading to unauthorized access to camera and microphone.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An application could use the device camera and/or microphone without the user's explicit consent or knowledge. This could lead to privacy violations such as unauthorized recording of audio and video.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to create and distribute a malicious Android application that does not request camera or microphone permissions. If the user installs the malicious application, the application would then be able to use the camera and/or microphone without explicit consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to develop and distribute Android applications. The attacker also relies on the user installing the malicious application.
