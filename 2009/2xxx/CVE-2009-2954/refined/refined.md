The provided content discusses a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability affecting multiple browsers, including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome. While it doesn't directly reference CVE-2009-2954, it describes a similar issue. Therefore, it is relevant, providing information about a DoS vulnerability in browsers.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a crafted HTML file that, when opened in vulnerable browsers, causes excessive consumption of CPU resources and, in some cases, memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inefficient handling of the crafted HTML file by the browser's rendering engine.
- Resource exhaustion due to the malicious HTML.
- Memory leaks (in some cases, memory is not released after closing the tab).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- CPU overload, leading to browser slowdown or freezing.
- Potential browser crashes.
- Memory exhaustion.
- System instability if the browser consumes excessive resources

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening a malicious HTML file in a vulnerable browser.
- Attackers can distribute malicious HTML via websites, links or attachments

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create or obtain the malicious HTML file.
- The attacker needs to have a way of delivering the malicious HTML file to the victim (e.g., by hosting it on a website, sending via email, etc.).
- The victim needs to open the file with a vulnerable browser.

**Affected Versions:**
- Mozilla Firefox 3.0.5 and previous versions (potentially Firefox 3.5.x)
- Internet Explorer 6 (6.0.2900.2180) and previous versions (potentially subsequent versions)
- Google Chrome 1.0.154.48 and previous versions (potentially subsequent versions)
