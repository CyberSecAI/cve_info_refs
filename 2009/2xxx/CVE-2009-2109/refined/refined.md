{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. The application uses unsanitized input from the 'language' GET parameter and the 'fretsweb_language' cookie, allowing an attacker to specify a file path which is then included by the application.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive information, source code, configuration files, or database credentials. This can lead to further attacks, such as privilege escalation or data theft.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL with the 'language' GET parameter containing a path to a local file or setting a 'fretsweb_language' cookie with the path to a local file. The application then includes this file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable FretsWeb application. They do not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability."
