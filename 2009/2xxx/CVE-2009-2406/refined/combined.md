c. Third party library update for ntp.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
this advisory.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant
for ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in this component (column 4) if a solution is available.

d. Service Console update for ntp

Service Console package ntp updated to version ntp-4.2.2pl-9el5\_3.2
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
The Service Console present in ESX is affected by the following
security issues.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
NTP authentication is not enabled by default on the Service Console.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A
malicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an
ntpq request that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ntpq
command.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0159 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in the Service Console (column 4) if a solution is available.

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

g. Updated Service Console package bind

Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5
The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.

#####

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these
issues.

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.

j. Updated Service Console package gnutls

Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5\_3.5
A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.

Package        : linux-2.6
Vulnerability  : denial of service, privilege escalation
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1895 CVE-2009-2287 CVE-2009-2406 CVE-2009-2407

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2009-1895

    Julien Tinnes and Tavis Ormandy reported an issue in the Linux
    personality code. Local users can take advantage of a setuid
    binary that can either be made to dereference a NULL pointer or
    drop privileges and return control to the user. This allows a
    user to bypass mmap_min_addr restrictions which can be exploited
    to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-2287

    Matt T. Yourst discovered an issue in the kvm subsystem. Local
    users with permission to manipulate /dev/kvm can cause a denial
    of service (hang) by providing an invalid cr3 value to the
    KVM_SET_SREGS call.

CVE-2009-2406
CVE-2009-2407

    Ramon de Carvalho Valle discovered two issues with the eCryptfs
    layered filesystem using the fsfuzzer utility. A local user with
    permissions to perform an eCryptfs mount may modify the contents
    of a eCryptfs file, overflowing the stack and potentially gaining
    elevated privileges.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.26-17lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems, where
applicable, will be fixed in updates to linux-2.6 and linux-2.6.24.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux
packages.

Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 5.0 (lenny)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.26-1um-2+17lenny1

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

Package        : linux-2.6.24
Vulnerability  : denial of service/privilege escalation
Problem type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1385 CVE-2009-1389 CVE-2009-1630 CVE-2009-1633
                 CVE-2009-1895 CVE-2009-1914 CVE-2009-1961 CVE-2009-2406
                 CVE-2009-2407

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2009-1385

    Neil Horman discovered a missing fix from the e1000 network driver.
    A remote user may cause a denial of service by way of a kernel panic
    triggered by specially crafted frame sizes.

CVE-2009-1389

    Michael Tokarev discovered an issue in the r8169 network driver.
    Remote users on the same LAN may cause a denial of service by way
    of a kernel panic triggered by receiving a large size frame.

CVE-2009-1630

    Frank Filz discovered that local users may be able to execute
    files without execute permission when accessed via an nfs4 mount.

CVE-2009-1633

    Jeff Layton and Suresh Jayaraman fixed several buffer overflows in
    the CIFS filesystem which allow remote servers to cause memory
    corruption.

CVE-2009-1895

    Julien Tinnes and Tavis Ormandy reported and issue in the Linux
    vulnerability code. Local users can take advantage of a setuid
    binary that can either be made to dereference a NULL pointer or
    drop privileges and return control to the user. This allows a
    user to bypass mmap_min_addr restrictions which can be exploited
    to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-1914

    Mikulas Patocka discovered an issue in sparc64 kernels that allows
    local users to cause a denial of service (crash) by reading the
    /proc/iomem file.

CVE-2009-1961

    Miklos Szeredi reported an issue in the ocfs2 filesystem. Local
    users can create a denial of service (filesystem deadlock) using
    a particular sequence of splice system calls.

CVE-2009-2406
CVE-2009-2407

    Ramon de Carvalho Valle discovered two issues with the eCryptfs
    layered filesystem using the fsfuzzer utility. A local user with
    permissions to perform an eCryptfs mount may modify the contents
    of a eCryptfs file, overflowing the stack and potentially gaining
    elevated privileges.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.8etch2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.

Note: Debian 'etch' includes linux kernel packages based upon both the
2.6.18 and 2.6.24 linux releases.  All known security issues are
carefully tracked against both packages and both packages will receive
security updates until security support for Debian 'etch'
concludes. However, given the high frequency at which low-severity
security issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource
requirements of doing an update, lower severity 2.6.18 and 2.6.24
updates will typically release in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch
- -------------------------------

Oldstable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice.org fixes potential buffer overflow in EMF
parser code (enhwmf.cxx, emfplus.cxx). Additionally Secunia reported an
integer underflow (CVE-2009-0200) and a buffer overflow (CVE-2009-0201)
that could be triggered while parsing Word documents.
Also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.1.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.1.1.html>
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, NLD9, SLE10, SLE11
- dnsmasq
This update fixes a buffer overflow in the TFTP server code of dnsmasq.
Please note that the TFTP server is disabled by default.
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE11
- gnutls
This update of gnutls improves the verification of the domain/subject
names in a SSL certificate. CVE-2009-2730 has been assigned to this
issue.
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10, SLE11
- ia32el
A 32bit x86 user program could crash the Itanium IA64 kernel in the
IA 32 (Intel 32bit) emulation. (CVE-2009-2707)
Released for product: SLE10
Updateing IA32EL to 7042\_7022, the same version as shipped on SLES 10
SP3, fixes this problem.
- ib-bonding-kmp-rt/kernel-rt/ofed
This patch updates the SLERT10 SP2 kernel to Update 7 to address
multiple issues:
- Lots of HR Timer fixes and improvements.
The complete list of changes can be seen in the rpm changelog.
It also fixes several security issues, some of the critical:
CVE-2009-2692: A missing NULL pointer check in the socket sendpage
function can be used by local attackers to gain root privileges.
CVE-2009-2406: A kernel stack overflow when mounting eCryptfs filesystems
in parse\_tag\_11\_packet() was fixed. Code execution might be possible
of ecryptfs is in use.
CVE-2009-2407: A kernel heap overflow when mounting eCryptfs filesystems
in parse\_tag\_3\_packet() was fixed. Code execution might be possible
of ecryptfs is in use.
Released for product: SLERT10
- libxml
This update of libxml does not use pointers after they were freed
anymore. (CVE-2009-2416)
Additionally a stack-based buffer overflow was fixed while parsing the
root XML document. (CVE-2009-2414)
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11
- opera
Opera version 10 includes at least security fixes for an XML
denial-of-service bug (CVE-2009-1234) and the "SSL tampering" attack
(CVE-2009-2059, CVE-2009-2063, CVE-2009-2067, CVE-2009-2070).
Released for product: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- perl-IO-Socket-SSL
This update of perl-IO-Socket-SSL improves the hostname checking of the
SSL certificate. (CVE-2009-3024)
Released for product: openSUSE 11.1, SLE11
- xen
xend did not properly enforce access control of the xenstore
directory tree, therefore allowing guest VM's to write there.
This could lead to security problems if other applications such as
libvirt are not prepared for untrusted data in the xenstore
directory (CVE-2008-4405).
Released for product: openSUSE 11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Linux kernel vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) -
* [linux-source-2.6.15](/security/cves?package=linux-source-2.6.15) -

## Details

Michael Tokarev discovered that the RTL8169 network driver did not

correctly validate buffer sizes. A remote attacker on the local network

could send specially crafted traffic that would crash the system or

potentially grant elevated privileges. ([CVE-2009-1389](/security/CVE-2009-1389))

Julien Tinnes and Tavis Ormandy discovered that when executing setuid

processes the kernel did not clear certain personality flags. A local

attacker could exploit this to map the NULL memory page, causing other

vulnerabilities to become exploitable. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected.

([CVE-2009-1895](/security/CVE-2009-1895))

Matt T. Yourst discovered that KVM did not correctly validate the

page table root. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the

system, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected.

([CVE-2009-2287](/security/CVE-2009-2287))

Ramon de Carvalho Valle discovered that eCryptfs did not correctly

validate certain buffer sizes. A local attacker could create specially

crafted eCryptfs files to crash the system or gain elevated privileges.

Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-2406](/security/CVE-2009-2406), [CVE-2009-2407](/security/CVE-2009-2407))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change for Ubuntu 9.04 the kernel

updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to

recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have

installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update

that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel

version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system

upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
