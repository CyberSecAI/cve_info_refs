Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2594:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `censura.php` script when handling the `itemid` parameter. Specifically, the script is vulnerable to SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks through this parameter.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:**  An attacker can inject SQL code into the `itemid` parameter when the `cmd` parameter is set to `details`, allowing them to potentially extract sensitive information from the database. The term "blind" indicates that the attacker may not see the direct results of the query, requiring them to infer information through the application's behavior.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `itemid` parameter, also when `cmd` is set to `details`, which will be executed by a user's browser when the vulnerable page is accessed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data within the application's database, including usernames, passwords, or other confidential information.
        *   Potential modification or deletion of data.
        *   Possible full database compromise.
    *  **Cross-Site Scripting:**
        *   Execution of malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser.
        *   Session hijacking.
        *   Defacement of the website.
        *   Phishing attacks or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by crafting specific HTTP GET requests to `censura.php` with a crafted `itemid` parameter. The requests are sent directly to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable `censura.php` script to send malicious requests.
    *   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP requests and be aware of SQL injection and XSS techniques.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit also references CVE-2009-2593, which is likely a related vulnerability in the same application.
*   The exploit mentions a demonstration URL (`http://www.yoozreviews.com/censura.php?cmd=details&itemid=61 and substring(@@version,1,1)=4`) showing a blind SQL injection attempt, and a demonstration URL for the XSS vulnerability (`http://www.yoozreviews.com/censura.php?cmd=details&itemid=<script>alert(123)</script>`)
