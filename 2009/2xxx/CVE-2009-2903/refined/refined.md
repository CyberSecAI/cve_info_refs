{
  "cveId": "CVE-2009-2903",
  "description": "The `handle_ip_over_ddp()` function in the Linux kernel's appletalk module does not properly free socket buffer structures (skb) when the `ipddp0` device is not found, leading to a memory leak. This occurs when both appletalk and ipddp modules are loaded, but the `ipddp` module fails to create the network interface. An attacker could exploit this by sending crafted IP-DDP datagrams, causing the system to exhaust memory and leading to a denial of service.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The root cause is a missing `kfree_skb()` call in `handle_ip_over_ddp()` when the `ipddp0` device does not exist, which occurs if the `ipddp` module fails to create the required network interface.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak in the kernel's appletalk subsystem.",
       "Missing resource cleanup when an error occurs."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit leads to a denial of service by exhausting kernel memory. This prevents the system from performing normal operations.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted IP-DDP datagrams to a vulnerable system."
    ],
     "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same link or have network access to send IP-DDP datagrams."
  },
  "additionalNotes": [
    "This vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions 2.4.x through 2.4.37.6 and 2.6.x through 2.6.31.",
    "The issue is present when the appletalk module is loaded but not the ipddp module, resulting in the ipddp0 device not existing.",
    "Mitigation includes loading both appletalk and ipddp modules, or disabling appletalk. Disabling appletalk requires unloading the module or rebooting if the module is already loaded.",
      "The vulnerability is fixed in the upstream kernel with commit id ffcfb8db540ff879c2a85bf7e404954281443414.",
    "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 are not affected as the vulnerable driver is not enabled in those kernels.",
    "The vulnerability exists in Red Hat Enterprise MRG and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, but only if the kernel-unsupported package is installed."
