| [Description](#c0)  Dimitri Aivaliotis    2002-05-14 17:34:29 UTC  ``` Hi,  VM is a major mode for Emacs/XEmacs.  It is a mail client with GPG and MIME support.  The ebuild is only configured for Emacs because I don't use XEmacs, but it shouldn't be too hard to adapt.  I suggest either net-mail/vm or app-editors/emacs/vm.  Thanks.  - Dimitri ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Dimitri Aivaliotis    2002-05-14 17:36:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 994](attachment.cgi?id=994 "vm-7.05.ebuild (New Package)") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=994&action=edit "vm-7.05.ebuild (New Package)")] vm-7.05.ebuild (New Package) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Andreas Koehler    2002-09-16 11:11:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3955](attachment.cgi?id=3955 "vm-7.07.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=3955&action=edit "vm-7.07.ebuild")] vm-7.07.ebuild  newer package and makes the vm info file available to info/dir. i suggest net-mail/vm since app-editors/emacs/vm should be impossible to implement. would be glad to see this in portage tree :) ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Matthew Kennedy (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-10-21 02:29:50 UTC  ``` i'll close this for now as won't resolve. vm is included in app-emacs/vm  (<http://www.gentoo.org/~mkennedy/emacs-packages.html>) and will soon be  included in portage proper.  ``` |  |

# git: git-daemon Denial of service — GLSA **200907-05**

An error in git-daemon might lead to a Denial of Service via resource
consumption.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-util/git** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.3.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.3.3** |

### Background

git - the stupid content tracker, the revision control system used by
the Linux kernel team.

### Description

Shawn O. Pearce reported that git-daemon runs into an infinite loop
when handling requests that contain unrecognized arguments.

### Impact

A remote unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted
request to git-daemon, possibly leading to a Denial of Service (CPU
consumption).

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All git users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/git-1.6.3.3"
```
