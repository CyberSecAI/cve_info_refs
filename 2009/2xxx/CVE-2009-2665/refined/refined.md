Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2665:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Firefox handles document wrappers when a content policy is active and a `Link:` HTTP header is present. Specifically, the document's security wrapper was incorrectly being associated with the content policy component's global object instead of the document's intended scope. This occurred during the initial wrapper creation, before the document's `mScopeObject` was properly set. This incorrect wrapper was then cached and reused.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect Security Wrapper:** The `window` global object was receiving an incorrect security wrapper, which was parented to the chrome scope instead of the intended content scope.
- **Wrapper Caching:** This incorrect wrapper was then cached and reused, persisting the vulnerability.
- **Bypass of Security Checks:** The incorrect wrapper allowed access to privileged methods like `document.createComment()`, bypassing intended security checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** This allowed arbitrary JavaScript code to be executed with chrome privileges. This means that malicious web content could potentially perform actions normally only available to browser extensions or the browser's core code.
- **Broken Functionality:** The bug manifested as broken functionality on affected websites when extensions using content policies were installed (e.g., Adblock Plus, NoScript). This was due to the inability of website scripts to access core document methods, leading to a "permission denied" error.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP Header:** A `Link:` HTTP header that linked to something requiring a call to the content policy was required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Content Policy:** The presence of a JavaScript-based content policy, typically from a browser extension, was needed.
- **Vulnerable Firefox version:** This vulnerability was present in Firefox versions prior to 3.5.2

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to set `Link:` HTTP Header:** The attacker needs to control the webserver to set a `Link:` HTTP header that triggers the vulnerability.
- **User with Vulnerable Firefox:** The user must be using a vulnerable Firefox version (before 3.5.2) and have an extension installed that implements a content policy.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability was initially difficult to reproduce because it required a specific combination of factors (Link header, content policy, vulnerable Firefox version).
-   The vulnerability was introduced by a change related to caching DOM wrappers.
-   The fix involved ensuring that the correct scope object is associated with the document wrapper early in the process and avoiding caching bad wrappers.
-   The vulnerability was classified as critical due to the potential for privilege escalation.
-   The original report came from Wladimir Palant, a Mozilla add-on developer.
-   The presence of this vulnerability made it possible for a malicious website to leverage this vulnerability to perform actions with chrome privileges. This was demonstrated in bug 499910, which blocks this bug.
