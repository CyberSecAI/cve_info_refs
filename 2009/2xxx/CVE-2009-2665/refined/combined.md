# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-46

## Chrome privilege escalation due to incorrectly cached wrapper

Announced
August 3, 2009
Reporter
Wladimir Palant, moz\_bug\_r\_a4
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.2

### Description

Mozilla add-on developer and community member **Wladimir
Palant** reported broken functionality on pages that had a
`Link:` HTTP header when an add-on was installed
which implemented a Content Policy in JavaScript, such
as AdBlock Plus or NoScript. Mozilla security
researcher **moz\_bug\_r\_a4** demonstrated that the broken
functionality was due to the `window`'s global object
receiving an incorrect security wrapper and that this issue could be
used to execute arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges.

This vulnerability does not affect Firefox
prior to version 3.5

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

Attached file
[Minimal content policy for testing](attachment.cgi?id=383707)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=383707&action=edit)

I reproduced this issue with 20090616031659 Minefield nightly and with 20090617032001 Shiretoko nightly, everything works fine in Firefox 3.0.11 however. Functionality of market.yandex.ru website is broken if any JavaScript-based content policy is present. In particular, the panel on the right (the one with orange border) doesn't load. I see two errors in the console:
Error: Permission denied for <<http://market.yandex.ru>> to call method HTMLDocument.createComment on <>.
Source File: <http://js.static.yandex.net/jquery/1.3.2/_jquery.js>
Line: 19
Error: Permission denied for <<http://market.yandex.ru>> to get property HTMLDocument.compatMode from <>.
Source File: <http://lego.static.yandex.net/2.0/common/js/_common.js>
Line: 1
There are more errors but I guess that those are follow-up errors. The website uses <http://suggest.market.yandex.ru/jquery.crossframeajax.html> frame for cross-site communication, I guess that's where the errors come from. I will try to analyze further but the way this site works is pretty complex (packed jQuery doesn't make it easier either).
Steps to reproduce:
1. Download nsTestPolicy.js from the attachment and put it into "c:\Program files\Mozilla Firefox\components" directory (adjust the path if the Firefox installation directory is different for you).
2. Put an .autoreg file into your Firefox profile.
3. Start Firefox.
4. Go to <http://market.yandex.ru/guru.xml?CMD=-RR=0,0,0,0-VIS=160-CAT_ID=754893-EXC=1-PG=50&view=&num=&sort=&hid=91020&filter=&grhow>=
Observed results:
Panel on the right shows a progress indicator that never goes away.
Expected results:
The panel on the right should load eventually (usually within a few seconds).
Requesting blocking1.9.1 because this doesn't seem to be limited to this website or even to jQuery.Flags: blocking1.9.1?

I stand corrected, typing "javascript:alert(document.createComment())" into the location bar on this webpage produces the same exception (document.createElement() can be used however). The website cannot access its own document for some reason.

I traced it back to the <http://bs.yandex.ru/resource/watch.js> script - having only this script on the page already causes the issue. So not related to jQuery after all.

Wladimir: in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=498897#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - Web code gets \"permission denied\" error if a content policy is present") you say that this isn't limited to the website or jQuery, and then in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=498897#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Web code gets \"permission denied\" error if a content policy is present") you say that it's limited to a single script.

I managed to reduce the testcase to the following:
<script type="text/javascript">
new function () {
function foo() {}
};
</script>
It is hard to test this because there is some weird kind of persistence - once the bug manifests itself it continues manifesting itself on that host and somehow survives even browser restarts (???).
Moving to JavaScript Engine, seems to belong there.

And what's the effect on users?

| [Comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=498897#c7)• 16 years ago |
|  | |

The effect on users is broken functionality on any site that uses a construct like this, that would typically be JavaScript-heavy sites. I am not sure why only some DOM methods are affected however - e.g. document.createComment() won't work while document.createElement() is fine. Assuming that an extension using content policies is installed (that includes Adblock Plus, NoScript, GreaseMonkey, Google Toolbar and a bunch of other extensions).

| [Comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=498897#c8)• 16 years ago |
|  | |

createComment is not quickstubbed, while createElement is. So createElement doesn't do a call-time security check, while createComment does.
Wladimir, I'm not going to be able to look into this until tomorrow; not sure about Blake. Do you think you can hunt down a regression range in the meantime? This sounds like something goes wrong with our wrapperization to me.

I'm still having trouble understanding what the practical impact of this is. Can someone tell me about an add-on / website pair that has broken functionality, and how that brokenness manifests itself?

Attached file
[Testcase](attachment.cgi?id=383874)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=383874&action=edit)

Attaching testcase. New steps to reproduce:
1. Download nsTestPolicy.js from [attachment 383707](/attachment.cgi?id=383707 "Minimal content policy for testing") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=383707&action=edit "Minimal content policy for testing") and put it into "c:\Program
files\Mozilla Firefox\components" directory (adjust the path if the Firefox
installation directory is different for you).
2. Put an .autoreg file into your Firefox profile.
3. Start Firefox.
4. Open the testcase.
Observe an error message - document.createComment() couldn't be called. Will show "Success" in Firefox 3.0.11, that's the correct behavior.
I'm not sure any more that the code before the try..catch block is even needed to reproduce the problem. It seems that document.createComment() is broken most of the time but might work eventually - I simply don't understand under which conditions it is working. I originally thought about some kind of persistence but starting Firefox with an empty profile didn't change anything.

The testcase gives me "Success" from Bugzilla but "Error" from localhost. I can only guess that the bug manifests on plain HTTP.

So, to be clear, this is something that's been broken since before we branched, and we're only noticing now? To me that's a pretty strong indicator that it needn't block, though should likely be fixed in a stability increase.

One thing that may have made it harder for people to run into this is that you need a scripted contentpolicy installed. So you need to have something like adblockplus or noscript installed. Have those been working for a long time on the 1.9.1 branch?

I'm very concerned that this is a security problem. If we're handing back some sort of wrapper here, then it's quite likely that this can be exploited by the page.

Adblock Plus was always compatible with Firefox nightlies, same with NoScript from what I can tell. So it is very surprising that I got the first report about this issue only yesterday (less so that this went unnoticed on NoScript's side - breaking websites is the expected side-effect there).

I, too, am very concerned about the possibility for exploits here. In particular, we're handing back an XPCWrappedNative for the document that is parented to a chrome scope. We don't know of any current exploits for this, but it's scary...

This also requires a "link" HTTP header that links to something requiring a call to the content policy.

While I agree that that should be the case, the attached testcase doesn't seem need this. But I can't reproduce on the attached testcase, possibly due to it being https (according to [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=498897#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - Web code gets \"permission denied\" error if a content policy is present")), though not sure why that would be.
Wladimir, you can for sure reproduce with the testcase as attached when loaded through http, right?

Ouch, things suddenly start to make sense. Yes, I have a Link HTTP header on localhost, left-over from testing something else. This explains why the problem isn't reproducible in Bugzilla.
Not blocking then. However, if web content gets a cached wrapper meant for chrome code (content policy), this might have security implications.Flags: blocking1.9.1?

[Backtraces showing the problem](attachment.cgi?id=383901)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=383901&action=edit)

What's happening is that we create a wrapper for the document at a point where it doesn't have a mScopeObject yet, so nsNodeSH::PreCreate just returns the global object that it gets passed in as the parent. In this case that's the content policy component's global object. The first backtrace is where we create the wrapper for the document, the second is where it gets its mScopeObject set.

We could do this, it seems to fix the problem for me. Blake, what do you think? The old wrapper will stick around in the hash for the wrong scope, but that was already the case before. If we want to fix that we'll need to somehow get the right parent from the start in the PreCreate hook.

This won't work since we need the inner window, which probably doesn't exist yet when we call the content policy.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers
