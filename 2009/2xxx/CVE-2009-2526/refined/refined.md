Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-2526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol software not properly validating fields within specially crafted SMB version 2 (SMBv2) packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation of SMBv2 packets.
- The server-side SMBv2 implementation is susceptible to a denial-of-service condition due to improper handling of specific SMBv2 packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service condition, causing the affected computer to become unresponsive until it is restarted. 
- The attacker can cause a system to stop responding and require a manual restart. The service will no longer accept new requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without requiring prior authentication.
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SMBv2 packet to a computer running the Server service.
- The attack vector is a network message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target server.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need specific user rights to cause the denial of service.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects systems running Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 that support SMBv2.
- Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are not affected.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling SMBv2 or by blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall.
- This CVE was initially reported through responsible disclosure and was not known to be actively exploited when the security bulletin was released.
