Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-2512:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the Web Services on Devices API (WSDAPI), specifically how it processes headers within WSD messages. The API fails to properly validate specific headers in received messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Improper handling of WSD message headers leads to memory corruption. This indicates a flaw in how the API parses and processes data, potentially causing a buffer overflow or similar memory error.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The memory corruption can be leveraged to achieve remote code execution, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Control:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker complete control over the affected system.
- **Malicious Activities:** Attackers can install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user privileges.
- **System Compromise:** Leads to a full compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted WSD Messages:** Attackers can send specially crafted WSD messages with malicious headers to the vulnerable system.
- **Targeted Ports:** The default ports targeted by these malicious messages are TCP ports 5357 and 5358. However, other ports might also be vulnerable if used by applications employing WSDAPI.
- **Malicious Responses to Device Discovery:** Attackers could send a malicious response to a WSD device discovery request by a Windows client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** Attackers on the same local subnet as the vulnerable system can exploit this vulnerability directly.
- **Unauthenticated Access:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without the attacker being authenticated on the target system.
- **No User Interaction Required:** For direct attacks on TCP ports 5357 and 5358, no user interaction is needed. However, exploiting the device discovery attack vector may require social engineering.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** for affected versions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.
- The issue is resolved by correcting the processing of headers in WSD messages.
- Workarounds included blocking specific TCP/UDP ports, which would impact device discovery functionality.
- The vulnerability was privately reported.
