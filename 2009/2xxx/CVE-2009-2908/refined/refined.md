  "CVE-2009-2908": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in eCryptfs which can result in a NULL pointer dereference. When calling vfs_unlink() on the lower dentry, d_delete() turns the dentry into a negative dentry when the d_count is 1. This eventually caused a NULL pointer deref when a read() or write() was done and the negative dentry's d_inode was dereferenced in ecryptfs_read_update_atime() or ecryptfs_getxattr().",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `d_delete` function in `fs/ecryptfs/inode.c` turns a dentry into a negative dentry when `d_count` is 1 during an unlink operation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference",
        "Improper handling of negative dentries"
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker could exploit the NULL pointer dereference to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPS). Arbitrary code execution is possible because the affected pointer may contain function pointers.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access",
         "Specially crafted read/write operations on a deleted file in an ecryptfs filesystem"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to trigger the vulnerability through operations on files within an ecryptfs mount. This can be achieved by using a program like Mutt with its temporary directory located in an encrypted home directory."
    },
    "affected_components": [
        "eCryptfs file system module in the Linux kernel"
    ],
     "additional_information": "The issue was triggered by using Mutt with its temporary directory located inside an encrypted home directory, causing a NULL pointer dereference in the `touch_atime` function, specifically when accessing a dentry's inode which has been deleted. The fix prevents the `touch_atime` function from being called on a negative dentry. A patch was developed to check for `lower_dentry != NULL` before calling the `touch_atime` function. This was then pulled by Linus Torvalds into the mainline kernel."
