How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

Hi

My home is on ecryptfs; this crash occurs when viewing emails with Mutt's built-in viewer. Mutt's tmpdir points to my home, if I set it to e.g. /tmp, the bug doesn't occur as it's not on ecryptfs.

Bye

I get the same oops here, usually triggered by plasma-desktop (causes KDE4 desktop, panel & widgets to disappear). Workaround is to restart plasma desktop.

Linux pororo 2.6.31-9-generic #29-Ubuntu SMP Sun Aug 30 17:39:26 UTC 2009 x86\_64 GNU/Linux

I have a dmesg log saved, happy to attach if it'll help.

Had a bit of time to look into this, hope this helps:

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000220

From looking at the oops log, r12 is indeed 0. Referring to source of touch\_atime:

void touch\_atime(struct vfsmount \*mnt, struct dentry \*dentry)

{

 struct inode \*inode = dentry->d\_inode;

 struct timespec now;

if (mnt\_want\_write(mnt))

  return;

 if (inode->i\_flags & S\_NOATIME)

  goto out;

We're oopsing on the ionode->i\_flags dereference, so dentry->d\_inode is NULL. I think it's safe to assume that this function should not be called on a negative dentry.

From a brief look at ecryptfs\_read\_update\_atime, it seems that there is no reference on the "lower" dentry when it's added to d\_fsdata, so perhaps we need a check for lower\_dentry != NULL around that call to touch\_atime. I'm not entirely sure that this is the correct solution, but we shouldn't be updating dentries for files that have been removed.

Hi all,

I wrote a patch that solve (I suppose) this bug.

To grab the inode I have used 'file->f\_mapping->host'.

It works on my machine.

Hmm, we can carry that patch against mutt in the mean time.

But, Tyler, this is more likely a problem with the ecryptfs kernel code, right?

Doh, now I look at the patch ... It is against ecryptfs. /me eats his words.

Tyler, can you take a look at that, and ack it and apply it upstream, if it's okay by you? We could carry this in Karmic, assuming it'll go upstream.

While Vincenzo's patch does keep the oops from occurring, I don't believe it is the correct fix. I had started working on this bug and didn't feel like the dentry should be negative at this point. My gut feeling is an error in ecryptfs\_link() or more likely, ecryptfs\_unlink(). I should get some more time to look at this in a day or two.

It turned out to be a pretty simple fix. I've tested this pretty thoroughly in f11 with the latest mainline git tree.

Hi Loïc - I'm having a hard time reproducing that dmesg with 2.6.32-rc1. I decided that this would be a good time to organize my inbox, but after about 30 minutes of working inside of mutt, I'm still not seeing this those messages. Is there any chance that you can pinpoint the sequence of actions needed to trigger the message?

Well I can't either :-)

Sometime after these, I got a system hang with black screen in screensaver or something; no capslock, no blinking lights.

I hard rebooted and couldn't reproduce the dmesg issue either.

Let's leave this bug to rest; I shall open another one if I consistently reproduce the issue.

(BTW fixing this bug already save some data for me: I was composing an email with tmpdir under my $HOME again when the hard crash occured, and I could recover it after reboot -- yeah!)

That sounds like a good idea to me. Glad to hear you were able to recover the email!

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=527534#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-10-06 20:21:10 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in ecryptfs which can result in a NULL pointer dereference. Quoting the commit message:    When calling vfs_unlink() on the lower dentry, d_delete() turns the   dentry into a negative dentry when the d_count is 1.  This eventually   caused a NULL pointer deref when a read() or write() was done and the   negative dentry's d_inode was dereferenced in   ecryptfs_read_update_atime() or ecryptfs_getxattr().  The upstream commit is here: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.31.y.git;a=commit;h=afc2b6932f48f200736d3e36ad66fee0ec733136>  There is a launchpad bug with more details here: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/+bug/387073](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/%2Bbug/387073)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=527534#c1)  Josh Bressers    2009-10-06 20:22:15 UTC  ``` I suspect this flaw could result in arbitrary code execution, but I'm not 100% honestly. The pointer in question does contain function pointers. It's possible it's not, but my limited knowledge tells me to treat is as such.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=527534#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-10-13 12:42:27 UTC  ``` MITRE's [CVE-2009-2908](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-2908) entry: ----------------------------  The d_delete function in fs/ecryptfs/inode.c in eCryptfs in the Linux kernel 2.6.31 allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPS) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors that cause a "negative dentry" and trigger a NULL pointer dereference, as demonstrated via a Mutt temporary directory in an eCryptfs mount.

### Bug Description

Hi

My home is on ecryptfs; this crash occurs when viewing emails with Mutt's built-in viewer. Mutt's tmpdir points to my home, if I set it to e.g. /tmp, the bug doesn't occur as it's not on ecryptfs.

Bye

I get the same oops here, usually triggered by plasma-desktop (causes KDE4 desktop, panel & widgets to disappear). Workaround is to restart plasma desktop.

I have a dmesg log saved, happy to attach if it'll help.

Had a bit of time to look into this, hope this helps:

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000220

From looking at the oops log, r12 is indeed 0. Referring to source of touch\_atime:

void touch\_atime(struct vfsmount \*mnt, struct dentry \*dentry)

{

 struct inode \*inode = dentry->d\_inode;

 struct timespec now;

if (mnt\_want\_write(mnt))

  return;

 if (inode->i\_flags & S\_NOATIME)

  goto out;

We're oopsing on the ionode->i\_flags dereference, so dentry->d\_inode is NULL. I think it's safe to assume that this function should not be called on a negative dentry.

From a brief look at ecryptfs\_read\_update\_atime, it seems that there is no reference on the "lower" dentry when it's added to d\_fsdata, so perhaps we need a check for lower\_dentry != NULL around that call to touch\_atime. I'm not entirely sure that this is the correct solution, but we shouldn't be updating dentries for files that have been removed.

Hi all,

I wrote a patch that solve (I suppose) this bug.

To grab the inode I have used 'file->f\_mapping->host'.

It works on my machine.

Hmm, we can carry that patch against mutt in the mean time.

But, Tyler, this is more likely a problem with the ecryptfs kernel code, right?

Doh, now I look at the patch ... It is against ecryptfs. /me eats his words.

Tyler, can you take a look at that, and ack it and apply it upstream, if it's okay by you? We could carry this in Karmic, assuming it'll go upstream.

While Vincenzo's patch does keep the oops from occurring, I don't believe it is the correct fix. I had started working on this bug and didn't feel like the dentry should be negative at this point. My gut feeling is an error in ecryptfs\_link() or more likely, ecryptfs\_unlink(). I should get some more time to look at this in a day or two.

@Dustin - lets leave this assigned to me or Tyler. Its in the OMG kitten killer class, and I don't want to miss getting it fixed for the Beta release. After all, if folks can't read their email with mutt then the whole might grind to a halt.

It turned out to be a pretty simple fix. I've tested this pretty thoroughly in f11 with the latest mainline git tree.

ay to check kernel and grub 2 on the version 2.6.31 and do a review or if the grub2

we should move this very green and use the version 9.04

Hi Loïc - I'm having a hard time reproducing that dmesg with 2.6.32-rc1. I decided that this would be a good time to organize my inbox, but after about 30 minutes of working inside of mutt, I'm still not seeing this those messages. Is there any chance that you can pinpoint the sequence of actions needed to trigger the message?

Well I can't either :-)

Sometime after these, I got a system hang with black screen in screensaver or something; no capslock, no blinking lights.

I hard rebooted and couldn't reproduce the dmesg issue either.

Let's leave this bug to rest; I shall open another one if I consistently reproduce the issue.

(BTW fixing this bug already save some data for me: I was composing an email with tmpdir under my $HOME again when the hard crash occured, and I could recover it after reboot -- yeah!)

That sounds like a good idea to me. Glad to hear you were able to recover the email!

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=527534#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-10-06 20:21:10 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in ecryptfs which can result in a NULL pointer dereference. Quoting the commit message:    When calling vfs_unlink() on the lower dentry, d_delete() turns the   dentry into a negative dentry when the d_count is 1.  This eventually   caused a NULL pointer deref when a read() or write() was done and the   negative dentry's d_inode was dereferenced in   ecryptfs_read_update_atime() or ecryptfs_getxattr().  The upstream commit is here: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.31.y.git;a=commit;h=afc2b6932f48f200736d3e36ad66fee0ec733136>  There is a launchpad bug with more details here: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/+bug/387073](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/%2Bbug/387073)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=527534#c1)  Josh Bressers    2009-10-06 20:22:15 UTC  ``` I suspect this flaw could result in arbitrary code execution, but I'm not 100% honestly. The pointer in question does contain function pointers. It's possible it's not, but my limited knowledge tells me to treat is as such.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=527534#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-10-13 12:42:27 UTC  ``` MITRE's [CVE-2009-2908](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-2908) entry: ----------------------------  The d_delete function in fs/ecryptfs/inode.c in eCryptfs in the Linux kernel 2.6.31 allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPS) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors that cause a "negative dentry" and trigger a NULL pointer dereference, as demonstrated via a Mutt temporary directory in an eCryptfs mount.

## Details

Solar Designer discovered that the z90crypt driver did not correctly

check capabilities. A local attacker could exploit this to shut down

the device, leading to a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06.

([CVE-2009-1883](/security/CVE-2009-1883))

Michael Buesch discovered that the SGI GRU driver did not correctly check

the length when setting options. A local attacker could exploit this

to write to the kernel stack, leading to root privilege escalation or

a denial of service. Only affected Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2584](/security/CVE-2009-2584))

It was discovered that SELinux did not fully implement the mmap\_min\_addr

restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to allocate the

NULL memory page which could lead to further attacks against kernel

NULL-dereference vulnerabilities. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected.

([CVE-2009-2695](/security/CVE-2009-2695))

Cagri Coltekin discovered that the UDP stack did not correctly handle

certain flags. A local user could send specially crafted commands and

traffic to gain root privileges or crash the systeam, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 6.06. ([CVE-2009-2698](/security/CVE-2009-2698))

Hiroshi Shimamoto discovered that monotonic timers did not correctly

validate parameters. A local user could make a specially crafted timer

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only affected Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2767](/security/CVE-2009-2767))

Michael Buesch discovered that the HPPA ISA EEPROM driver did not

correctly validate positions. A local user could make a specially crafted

request to gain root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2846](/security/CVE-2009-2846))

Ulrich Drepper discovered that kernel signal stacks were not being

correctly padded on 64-bit systems. A local attacker could send specially

crafted calls to expose 4 bytes of kernel stack memory, leading to a

loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-2847](/security/CVE-2009-2847))

Jens Rosenboom discovered that the clone method did not correctly clear

certain fields. A local attacker could exploit this to gain privileges

or crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-2848](/security/CVE-2009-2848))

It was discovered that the MD driver did not check certain sysfs files.

A local attacker with write access to /sys could exploit this to cause

a system crash, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 6.06 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-2849](/security/CVE-2009-2849))

Mark Smith discovered that the AppleTalk stack did not correctly

manage memory. A remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic

to cause the system to consume all available memory, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-2903](/security/CVE-2009-2903))

Loïc Minier discovered that eCryptfs did not correctly handle writing

to certain deleted files. A local attacker could exploit this to gain

root privileges or crash the system, leading to a denial of service.

Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-2908](/security/CVE-2009-2908))

It was discovered that the LLC, AppleTalk, IR, EConet, Netrom, and

ROSE network stacks did not correctly initialize their data structures.

A local attacker could make specially crafted calls to read kernel memory,

leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3001](/security/CVE-2009-3001), [CVE-2009-3002](/security/CVE-2009-3002))

It was discovered that the randomization used for Address Space Layout

Randomization was predictable within a small window of time. A local

attacker could exploit this to leverage further attacks that require

knowledge of userspace memory layouts. ([CVE-2009-3238](/security/CVE-2009-3238))

Eric Paris discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly handle file creation

failures. An attacker with write access to an NFSv4 share could exploit

this to create files with arbitrary mode bits, leading to privilege

escalation or a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3286](/security/CVE-2009-3286))

Bob Tracy discovered that the SCSI generic driver did not correctly use

the right index for array access. A local attacker with write access

to a CDR could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. Only Ubuntu 9.04 was affected. ([CVE-2009-3288](/security/CVE-2009-3288))

Jan Kiszka discovered that KVM did not correctly validate certain

hypercalls. A local unprivileged attacker in a virtual guest could exploit

this to crash the guest kernel, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu

6.06 was not affected. ([CVE-2009-3290](/security/CVE-2009-3290))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2009:1548 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: kernel security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1548)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Security fixes:

* a system with SELinux enforced was more permissive in allowing local

users in the unconfined\_t domain to map low memory areas even if the
mmap\_min\_addr restriction was enabled. This could aid in the local
exploitation of NULL pointer dereference bugs. (CVE-2009-2695, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the eCryptfs implementation

in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a local
denial of service or escalate their privileges. (CVE-2009-2908, Important)

* a flaw was found in the NFSv4 implementation. The kernel would do an

unnecessary permission check after creating a file. This check would
usually fail and leave the file with the permission bits set to random
values. Note: This is a server-side only issue. (CVE-2009-3286, Important)

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following

functions in the Linux kernel: pipe\_read\_open(), pipe\_write\_open(), and
pipe\_rdwr\_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i\_pipe pointer could
be released by other processes before it is used to update the pipe's
reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of service or
privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3547, Important)

* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux

kernel. pci\_unmap\_single() presented a memory leak that could lead to IOMMU
space exhaustion and a system crash. An attacker on the local network could
abuse this flaw by using jumbo frames for large amounts of network traffic.
(CVE-2009-3613, Important)

* missing initialization flaws were found in the Linux kernel. Padding data

in several core network structures was not initialized properly before
being sent to user-space. These flaws could lead to information leaks.
(CVE-2009-3228, Moderate)

Bug fixes:

* with network bonding in the "balance-tlb" or "balance-alb" mode, the

primary setting for the primary slave device was lost when said device was
brought down. Bringing the slave back up did not restore the primary
setting. (BZ#517971)

* some faulty serial device hardware caused systems running the kernel-xen

kernel to take a very long time to boot. (BZ#524153)

* a caching bug in nfs\_readdir() may have caused NFS clients to see

duplicate files or not see all files in a directory. (BZ#526960)

* the RHSA-2009:1243 update removed the mpt\_msi\_enable option, preventing

certain scripts from running. This update adds the option back. (BZ#526963)

* an iptables rule with the recent module and a hit count value greater

than the ip\_pkt\_list\_tot parameter (the default is 20), did not have any
effect over packets, as the hit count could not be reached. (BZ#527434)

* a check has been added to the IPv4 code to make sure that rt is not NULL,

to help prevent future bugs in functions that call ip\_append\_data() from
being exploitable. (BZ#527436)

* a kernel panic occurred in certain conditions after reconfiguring a tape

drive's block size. (BZ#528133)

* when using the Linux Virtual Server (LVS) in a master and backup

configuration, and propagating active connections on the master to the
backup, the connection timeout value on the backup was hard-coded to 180
seconds, meaning connection information on the backup was soon lost. This
could prevent the successful failover of connections. The timeout value
can now be set via "ipvsadm --set". (BZ#528645)

* a bug in nfs4\_do\_open\_expired() could have caused the reclaimer thread on

an NFSv4 client to enter an infinite loop. (BZ#529162)

* MSI interrupts may not have been delivered for r8169 based network cards

that have MSI interrupts enabled. This bug only affected certain systems.
(BZ#529366)

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

Hi

My home is on ecryptfs; this crash occurs when viewing emails with Mutt's built-in viewer. Mutt's tmpdir points to my home, if I set it to e.g. /tmp, the bug doesn't occur as it's not on ecryptfs.

Bye

I get the same oops here, usually triggered by plasma-desktop (causes KDE4 desktop, panel & widgets to disappear). Workaround is to restart plasma desktop.

I have a dmesg log saved, happy to attach if it'll help.

From looking at the oops log, r12 is indeed 0. Referring to source of touch\_atime:

void touch\_atime(struct vfsmount \*mnt, struct dentry \*dentry)

{

 struct inode \*inode = dentry->d\_inode;

 struct timespec now;

if (mnt\_want\_write(mnt))

  return;

 if (inode->i\_flags & S\_NOATIME)

  goto out;

We're oopsing on the ionode->i\_flags dereference, so dentry->d\_inode is NULL. I think it's safe to assume that this function should not be called on a negative dentry.

From a brief look at ecryptfs\_read\_update\_atime, it seems that there is no reference on the "lower" dentry when it's added to d\_fsdata, so perhaps we need a check for lower\_dentry != NULL around that call to touch\_atime. I'm not entirely sure that this is the correct solution, but we shouldn't be updating dentries for files that have been removed.

Hi all,

I wrote a patch that solve (I suppose) this bug.

To grab the inode I have used 'file->f\_mapping->host'.

It works on my machine.

Hmm, we can carry that patch against mutt in the mean time.

But, Tyler, this is more likely a problem with the ecryptfs kernel code, right?

Doh, now I look at the patch ... It is against ecryptfs. /me eats his words.

Tyler, can you take a look at that, and ack it and apply it upstream, if it's okay by you? We could carry this in Karmic, assuming it'll go upstream.

While Vincenzo's patch does keep the oops from occurring, I don't believe it is the correct fix. I had started working on this bug and didn't feel like the dentry should be negative at this point. My gut feeling is an error in ecryptfs\_link() or more likely, ecryptfs\_unlink(). I should get some more time to look at this in a day or two.

@Dustin - lets leave this assigned to me or Tyler. Its in the OMG kitten killer class, and I don't want to miss getting it fixed for the Beta release. After all, if folks can't read their email with mutt then the whole might grind to a halt.

It turned out to be a pretty simple fix. I've tested this pretty thoroughly in f11 with the latest mainline git tree.

very slow boot not booting as it should be good grub 2 should still be green

ay to check kernel and grub 2 on the version 2.6.31 and do a review or if the grub2

we should move this very green and use the version 9.04

Hi Loïc - I'm having a hard time reproducing that dmesg with 2.6.32-rc1. I decided that this would be a good time to organize my inbox, but after about 30 minutes of working inside of mutt, I'm still not seeing this those messages. Is there any chance that you can pinpoint the sequence of actions needed to trigger the message?

Well I can't either :-)

Sometime after these, I got a system hang with black screen in screensaver or something; no capslock, no blinking lights.

I hard rebooted and couldn't reproduce the dmesg issue either.

Let's leave this bug to rest; I shall open another one if I consistently reproduce the issue.

(BTW fixing this bug already save some data for me: I was composing an email with tmpdir under my $HOME again when the hard crash occured, and I could recover it after reboot -- yeah!)

That sounds like a good idea to me. Glad to hear you were able to recover the email!

Subject: Kernel ecryptfs CVE id (CVE-2009-2908)

As some of you may have noticed, the 2.6.31.2 kernel contained this bit in the
changelog:
eCryptfs: Prevent lower dentry from going negative ...

The commit is here:
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.31.y.git;a=commit;h=afc2b6932f48f200736d3e36ad66fee0ec733136>

I've assigned this CVE-2009-2908. At the very least it's a DoS as it causes an
OOPS due to a NULL pointer dereference, it may allow arbitrary code execution
as the structure in question does contain function pointers. If someone who
knows more than me wants to chime in here, please do.

I've filed a bug in the Red Hat Bugzilla:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=527534>

It doesn't really contain any additional data. If I discover anything new,
I'll add my comments there.

Thanks.
