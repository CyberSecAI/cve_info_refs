Not, look at them or even copy, but modify, delete or 'steal' saved queries.  This, IMO, puts many hours of hard work by many Roundup users at peril. More so when people rely on queries as bookmarks (passing a list of IDs). Some instances have > 200 saved queries.  E.g., by going to <http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/query> , one can take a private query from someone else and set 'private_for' to another UID, delete queries or subtly change the query parameters (adding spam to @ok_message and @error_message comes to mind).  The shallow problem lies in cgi/actions.py:EditCSVAction not having the same level of control over queries that cgi/actions.py:SearchAction has, giving Users Admin-level powers over other Users' queries. I have tried to fix that by special-casing "query" in EditCSVAction, only allowing 'Developer' and higher to use that action for queries.  The deep problem would be that Query isn't a Class like others. Checking for creator == UID in EditCSVAction would hit this issue: how do you separate an Admin's Edit permission from an User's Edit permission? If you special-case for Role, hey, that's what I tried :)  SearchAction lets anyone look at all queries (e.g., <http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/query3> ) and allows Users to make copies of them. That's not the issue here. This report is about the fact that EditCSVAction lets anyone delete or modify everyone else's queries. ``` | | | | | <msg3619> | Author: [hidden] (ajaksu2) | Date: 2009-03-08 12:37 |  | | ``` Here's a temporary fix, given the potential hassle described in private email (mail me or roundup-devel and I'll reply with details).  We could either ditch EditCSVAction entirely or add permission checks to it, if it's an useful action.  To solve this class of problems, I think it'd be necessary to add another kind of permission ('EditCSV') to Roles and check for that. ``` | | | | | <msg3635> | Author: [hidden] (richard) | Date: 2009-03-12 02:56 |  | | ``` I believe this has been addressed in [r4081](http://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/4081) ``` | | | |  | History | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Date | User | Action | Args | | 2009-03-12 02:56:18 | richard | set | assignee: [richard](user4) | | 2009-03-12 02:56:11 | richard | set | status: new -> closedresolution: fixedmessages: + <msg3635>nosy: + [richard](user4) | | 2009-03-08 12:37:24 | ajaksu2 | set | files: + [avoid\_editcsv\_trunk.diff](file368)keywords: + [patch](keyword1)messages: + <msg3619> | | 2009-02-26 00:06:14 | ajaksu2 | create |  | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=489355#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-03-09 16:44:23 UTC  ```  It was found that any user able to create or edit queries in roundup is able to edit all queries (delete or modify other user's queries).  This is due to EditCSVAction not having the same level of control over queries that SearchAction does (both in cgi/actions.py).  This gives users admin-level power over other user's queries.  The upstream bug report is here: <http://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2550521> and the Debian bug report is here: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=518768>  The recommended fix from upstream is to disable EditCSVAction altogether.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=489355#c1)  Vincent Danen    2009-03-09 16:44:47 UTC  ``` Created roundup tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: F10 [[bug #489356](show_bug.cgi?id=489356 "CLOSED NEXTRELEASE - roundup: privilege escalation in EditCSVAction [F10]")] Affects: F9 [[bug #489357](show_bug.cgi?id=489357 "CLOSED NEXTRELEASE - roundup: privilege escalation in EditCSVAction [F9]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=489355#c3)  Vincent Danen    2009-03-09 16:47:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 334557](attachment.cgi?id=334557&action=diff "patch from Debian's BTS to fix the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=334557&action=edit "patch from Debian's BTS to fix the issue") patch from Debian's BTS to fix the issue  This patch disables EditCSVAction.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=489355#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-03-11 17:57:25 UTC  ``` roundup-1.4.6-4.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=489355#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-03-11 17:58:22 UTC  ``` roundup-1.4.6-4.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=489355#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2009-08-11 10:26:20 UTC  ``` CVE-2009-2737: The EditCSVAction function in cgi/actions.py in Roundup 1.2 before 1.2.1, 1.4 through 1.4.6, and possibly other versions does not properly check permissions, which allows remote authenticated users with edit or create privileges for a class to modify arbitrary items within that class, as demonstrated by editing all queries, modifying settings, and adding roles to users.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package: roundup
Version: 1.2.1-5+etch2
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hi,

Daniel Diniz discovered that EditCSVAction does not include appropriate
permission checks allowing any user to edit any item in a class she has
create / edit privileges for. This includes, amongst others, modifying
content of existing messages or issues, changing user settings or adding
roles to existing users which allows to gain admin privileges

The attack may be done using specially crafted but simple URLs. I'm not
adding an example since I'm not sure this should be made public yet. I
will provide examples to the package maintainer and the security team on
request though.

See upstream issue 2550521 [1] for more details and the original report
by Daniel - that issue mentions editing saved queries only though as the
real impact of the bug was not known at that time.

Afaik, there is no CVE for this issue yet.

Cheers,
Sebastian

Hi again,

The attached trivial patch disabled EditCSVAction altogether. Afaik,
this feature is useful for batch editing only and isn't used by any
other parts of the web-interface (however, features like "roundup-admin
import" might use it as well), so it should be an appropriate counter-
measure in most cases for now.

Cheers,
Sebastian

PS: This patch is against the roundup source tree. To apply it to your
    local installation use something like:

      cd /usr/share/pyshared
      patch -p1 < bts518768-disable-editcsv.patch

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1754-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Florian Weimer

Package        : roundup
Vulnerability  : insufficient access checks
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian Bug     : 518768

It was discovered that roundup, an issue tracker with a command-line,
web and email interface, allows users to edit resources in
unauthorized ways, including granting themselves admin rights.

This update introduces stricter access checks, actually enforcing the
configured permissions and roles.  This means that the configuration
may need updating.  In addition, user registration via the web
interface has been disabled; use the program "roundup-admin" from the
command line instead.

For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-10+etch1.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-4+lenny1.

We recommend that you upgrade your roundup package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
