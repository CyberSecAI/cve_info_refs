{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Calling the `select()` method with a large integer results in continuous memory allocation, leading to memory exhaustion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unbounded memory allocation",
    "Lack of input validation/sanitization on the size of the select element"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact varies depending on the browser and OS, ranging from a null pointer dereference causing browser crashes, to complete OS reboots. Other potential impacts include instability and hanging of devices.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious website or script that calls the `select()` method with a large integer as a parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript on a vulnerable device, usually by enticing a user to visit a malicious web page."
