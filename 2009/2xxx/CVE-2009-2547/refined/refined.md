{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a negative memcpy operation within the VoIP over Network (VON) protocol handler of the game server. The server calculates the length of data to copy based on an 8-bit number at the end of a specific type of packet. This calculation doesn't check if the resulting offset goes below the beginning of the data buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer underflow",
      "Lack of bounds checking",
      "Negative memory access"
    ],
    "impact": "The server crashes due to an access violation when it attempts to read memory before the start of the packet's data buffer.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is remote, targeting the game server. The attacker sends a crafted packet containing a value that causes a negative memory access in the memcpy operation.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the game server, either as a client or by spoofing their origin."
