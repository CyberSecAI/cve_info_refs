Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2814:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-2814

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Wiki Server's handling of search requests containing non-UTF-8 encoded data.
*   **Weakness:** The Wiki Server does not properly handle non-UTF-8 encoded data in search requests.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access a Wiki server with the credentials of the Wiki Server user performing the search. This means the attacker could potentially gain control of the user's account and potentially the Wiki Server, depending on user privileges.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by a remote attacker sending a crafted search request containing non-UTF-8 encoded data to the Wiki Server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Wiki Server and needs to know a target user exists that could be tricked into making a malicious request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Wiki Server's failure to properly sanitize or handle search requests that contain non-UTF-8 encoded data. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code or scripts that are then executed within the context of the victim's browser when they perform the search.
*   The fix implemented was to set UTF-8 as the default character set in HTTP responses. This prevents the browser from interpreting the injected code in unintended ways, thus mitigating the XSS vulnerability.

**Affected Systems:**

* Mac OS X Server v10.5.8 (This vulnerability does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5 or Mac OS X v10.6.)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, as it provides the root cause, impact, and remediation.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Security Update 2009-005 by setting UTF-8 as the default character set.

This information should be helpful in understanding the vulnerability and its impact.
