{
  "cveId": "CVE-2009-2676",
  "description": "A security vulnerability in the JNLPAppletLauncher may impact users of the Sun JDK and JRE. Non-current versions of the JNLPAppletLauncher may be re-purposed with an untrusted Java applet to write arbitrary files on the system of the user downloading and running the untrusted applet.\n\nThe JNLPAppletLauncher is a general purpose JNLP-based applet launcher class for deploying applets that use extension libraries containing native code.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The JNLPAppletLauncher, used for launching applets with native code extensions, has a vulnerability that allows it to be re-purposed by an untrusted Java applet.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in the JNLPAppletLauncher class, allowing an untrusted applet to write arbitrary files."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can use this vulnerability to write arbitrary files on the user's system when they download and run a malicious applet.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "The attack vector involves a user downloading and running an untrusted Java applet that exploits the vulnerable JNLPAppletLauncher.",
        "Attackers can leverage this vulnerability remotely by enticing users to open specially crafted JAR archives, applets, or Java Web Start applications."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker requires the ability to create or modify a malicious Java applet and have it downloaded and executed by a user."

  ],
 "additionalInformation": [
    "The vulnerability is present in the JNLPAppletLauncher, a class intended for launching applets using native extensions.",
    "The flaw can be exploited by crafting malicious Java applets that use the JNLPAppletLauncher to write arbitrary files.",
    "The vulnerability may lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.",
     "The vulnerability may allow disclosure of information and memory contents.",
     "The vulnerability may cause a Denial of Service.",
      "The vulnerability may allow writing or execution of local files.",
    "Some exploits may require user interaction or a compromised environment."
