Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2293:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure cookie handling in Tutorial Share 3.4. Specifically, the application does not properly validate or sanitize cookie data, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure Cookie Handling: The application directly uses cookie values without proper validation, leading to the potential for manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication Bypass: By manipulating the `usernamed` cookie, an attacker can gain administrative access without proper authentication.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through client-side cookie manipulation. An attacker can modify the `usernamed` cookie via Javascript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute Javascript in the context of the vulnerable application's domain. This could be done via:
    - Direct browser manipulation
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS) if an XSS vulnerability is present.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the cookie name (`usernamed`) used to store user information.

**More details than the official CVE description:**
The provided exploit-db entry gives a clear and concise attack scenario, including the exact cookie to modify, the value to set (`demo`), and demonstrates the bypass of authentication and access to `/admin/`. It also shows where to test the exploit via the tutorial-share.com demo site.
