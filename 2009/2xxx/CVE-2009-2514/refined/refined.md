Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2009-2514:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper parsing of font code within Windows kernel-mode drivers, specifically when building a table of directory entries for Embedded OpenType (EOT) fonts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness lies in the insufficient validation and handling of EOT font data by the Win32k kernel-mode driver. Specifically, the parsing logic does not adequately check or sanitize the data when constructing the directory table. This improper parsing can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code in the kernel mode. This enables the attacker to take complete control of the system, install malicious software, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker could host a malicious website with specially crafted embedded EOT fonts designed to exploit the vulnerability. Users visiting this website could be compromised if their browser renders the malicious font.
- **Email-based attack:** An attacker could embed a malicious EOT font within a Microsoft Office document (e.g. Word, PowerPoint) attached to an email. If the user opens or previews the file, the system can be compromised.
- Compromised websites and websites that accept or host user provided content or advertisements can also be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- For web-based attacks, the attacker needs to host a website with the malicious EOT font and lure the user to visit it.
- For email-based attacks, the attacker needs to send an email with a malicious attachment containing the crafted EOT font, and trick the user into opening it.
- In either scenario, an attacker would need to rely on social engineering tactics (e.g., tricking the user to click on a link or open an attachment).

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Microsoft Windows (2000, XP, Server 2003) with a Critical rating and some versions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 with an Important rating.
- Microsoft released a security update to fix the vulnerability by correcting the way Windows kernel-mode drivers parse font code.
- Workarounds, such as disabling support for parsing embedded fonts in Internet Explorer or denying access to the t2embed.dll file were provided to mitigate the risk before patches are applied.
- The vulnerability was initially reported through responsible disclosure, but later became public by a separate party.
