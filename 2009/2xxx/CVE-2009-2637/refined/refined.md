Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `toolbar_ext.php` file of the Joomla! BookLibrary component. This occurs because the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter is not properly sanitized and allows an attacker to include remote files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation on the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter in the `toolbar_ext.php` script. This allows an attacker to specify a remote URL, leading to remote file inclusion.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server. This could lead to complete compromise of the vulnerable Joomla! installation, including data theft, website defacement, or further attacks on the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `toolbar_ext.php`, by providing a malicious URL to the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Joomla! installation. No specific privileges are needed beyond network access.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit is triggered by using the following URL structure:

```
.../com_booklibrary/toolbar_ext.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=shell?
```

Here, `shell` would be the path to a malicious file controlled by the attacker. The `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter is used to specify an absolute path but it is not properly sanitized, allowing inclusion of remote URLs.
