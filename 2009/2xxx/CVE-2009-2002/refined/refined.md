This document discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle products, but it does not specify the details of individual CVEs. Therefore, I cannot verify if the content relates to CVE-2009-2002.

The document provides the following information:

**Vulnerabilities Present:** Multiple vulnerabilities exist across various Oracle products and components.
**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote execution of arbitrary code
*   Information disclosure
*   Denial of service
*  Access to sensitive information upon compromising an Oracle database
**Attack vectors:** Vulnerable components may be accessible to unauthenticated, remote attackers.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Remote unauthenticated access is possible in some cases.

The document refers to the Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2009, which likely contains the specific information for each vulnerability.
