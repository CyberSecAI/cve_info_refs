| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=510023#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-07 13:13:09 UTC  ``` We have received information from a third party regarding vulnerabilities in JBoss Application Server.  Input passed to the "monitorName", "objectName", "attribute", and "period" parameters in createSnapshot.jsp and to the "monitorName", "objectName", "attribute", "threshold", "period", and "enabled" parameters in createThresholdMonitor.jsp of the JBoss Web Console is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  The vulnerabilties are confirmed in version 5.1.0GA. Other versions may also be affected.  The preliminary disclosure date has been set to July 22th, 2009.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=510023#c2)  Farah Juma    2009-07-13 15:08:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 351481](attachment.cgi?id=351481&action=diff "A fix for the Web Console XSS issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=351481&action=edit "A fix for the Web Console XSS issue") A fix for the Web Console XSS issue  I was also able to reproduce this issue using EAP 4.3 CP05 and EAP 4.2 CP07.  Attached a patch:  The patch escapes HTML tags (i.e. converts "<" to "&lt;" and ">" to "&gt;") to make sure that the parameters to createSnapshot.jsp and createThresholdMonitor.jsp are sanitized before being displayed to the user. I will ask Dimitris to take a look at this patch.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=510023#c3)  Farah Juma    2009-07-14 19:10:46 UTC  ``` Today, Brian and I found that our patch currently does not handle an input like:  aaa" onmouseover=alert(1) "  In this case, moving the mouse over the input field causes a box to pop up. We are currently working on revising our patch to deal with this case as well.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=510023#c5)  Farah Juma    2009-07-16 20:55:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 354047](attachment.cgi?id=354047&action=diff "A revised fix for the Web Console XSS issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=354047&action=edit "A revised fix for the Web Console XSS issue") A revised fix for the Web Console XSS issue  Brian and I have revised our patch so that single quotes and double quotes in the input are also escaped (i.e. we convert "'" to "&apos;" and """ to "&quot;"). We will commit our patch to the JBPAPP_4_2_0_GA_CP branch, Branch_5_x, and trunk.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=510023#c6)  Farah Juma    2009-07-17 15:08:45 UTC  ``` We have applied the patch to the JBPAPP_4_2_0_GA_CP branch, Branch_5_x, and trunk.

## Topic

Updated JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBEAP) 4.3 packages that fix
multiple security issues, several bugs, and add enhancements are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as JBEAP 4.3.0.CP07.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is the market leading platform for
innovative and scalable Java applications; integrating the JBoss
Application Server, with JBoss Hibernate and JBoss Seam into a complete,
simple enterprise solution.

This release of JBEAP for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 serves as a
replacement to JBEAP 4.3.0.CP06.

These updated packages include bug fixes and enhancements which are
detailed in the Release Notes, available shortly from:
<http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/>

The following security issues are also fixed with this release:

A missing check for the recommended minimum length of the truncated form of
HMAC-based XML signatures was found in xml-security. An attacker could use
this flaw to create a specially-crafted XML file that forges an XML
signature, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication that is based on
the XML Signature specification. (CVE-2009-0217)

Swatej Kumar discovered cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws in the JBoss
Application Server Web Console. An attacker could use these flaws to
present misleading data to an authenticated user, or execute arbitrary
scripting code in the context of the authenticated user's browser session.
(CVE-2009-2405)

A flaw was found in the way the Apache Xerces2 Java Parser processed the
SYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an application using the
Apache Xerces2 Java Parser, would lead to a denial of service (application
hang due to excessive CPU use). (CVE-2009-2625)

An information leak flaw was found in the twiddle command line client. The
JMX password was logged in plain text to "twiddle.log". (CVE-2009-3554)

An XSS flaw was found in the JMX Console. An attacker could use this flaw
to present misleading data to an authenticated user, or execute arbitrary
scripting code in the context of the authenticated user's browser session.
(CVE-2009-1380)

Warning: Before applying this update, please backup the JBEAP
"server/[configuration]/deploy/" directory, and any other customized
configuration files.

All users of JBEAP 4.3 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 are advised to upgrade
to these updated packages.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=510023#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2009-07-07 13:13:09 UTC  ``` We have received information from a third party regarding vulnerabilities in JBoss Application Server.  Input passed to the "monitorName", "objectName", "attribute", and "period" parameters in createSnapshot.jsp and to the "monitorName", "objectName", "attribute", "threshold", "period", and "enabled" parameters in createThresholdMonitor.jsp of the JBoss Web Console is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  The vulnerabilties are confirmed in version 5.1.0GA. Other versions may also be affected.

Attached a patch:  The patch escapes HTML tags (i.e. converts "<" to "&lt;" and ">" to "&gt;") to make sure that the parameters to createSnapshot.jsp and createThresholdMonitor.jsp are sanitized before being displayed to the user. I will ask Dimitris to take a look at this patch.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=510023#c3)  Farah Juma    2009-07-14 19:10:46 UTC  ``` Today, Brian and I found that our patch currently does not handle an input like:  aaa" onmouseover=alert(1) "  In this case, moving the mouse over the input field causes a box to pop up. We are currently working on revising our patch to deal with this case as well.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=510023#c5)  Farah Juma    2009-07-16 20:55:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 354047](attachment.cgi?id=354047&action=diff "A revised fix for the Web Console XSS issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=354047&action=edit "A revised fix for the Web Console XSS issue") A revised fix for the Web Console XSS issue  Brian and I have revised our patch so that single quotes and double quotes in the input are also escaped (i.e. we convert "'" to "&apos;" and """ to "&quot;"). We will commit our patch to the JBPAPP_4_2_0_GA_CP branch, Branch_5_x, and trunk.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=510023#c6)  Farah Juma    2009-07-17 15:08:45 UTC  ``` We have applied the patch to the JBPAPP_4_2_0_GA_CP branch, Branch_5_x, and trunk.
