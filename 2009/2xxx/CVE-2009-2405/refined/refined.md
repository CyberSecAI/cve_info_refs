{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The JBoss Web Console does not properly sanitize user-controlled input before displaying it back to the user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session within the context of the affected site. This could lead to the attacker presenting misleading data or performing actions on behalf of the user.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting malicious input to the 'monitorName', 'objectName', 'attribute', and 'period' parameters in createSnapshot.jsp, as well as the 'monitorName', 'objectName', 'attribute', 'threshold', 'period', and 'enabled' parameters in createThresholdMonitor.jsp of the JBoss Web Console, an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to pass manipulated input to the vulnerable parameters within the JBoss Web Console."
  },
  "affected_products": [
    "JBoss Application Server versions 5.1.0GA and potentially other versions",
    "JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3 CP05",
    "JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.2 CP07"
  ],
    "fixes": [
    "HTML escaping applied to the parameters in `createSnapshot.jsp` and `createThresholdMonitor.jsp`.",
    "Single and double quotes in the input are also escaped (converted to &apos; and &quot;)"
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was fixed in the JBPAPP_4_2_0_GA_CP branch, Branch_5_x, trunk, and JBPAPP_5_0 branch.  The issue was addressed in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 and 4.2.0 for RHEL 4 and 5 via RHSA-2009:1636, RHSA-2009:1637, RHSA-2009:1649 and RHSA-2009:1650 erratas. The flaw does not affect Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5 or 6."
