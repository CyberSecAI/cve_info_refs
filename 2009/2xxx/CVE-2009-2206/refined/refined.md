{
  "CVE-2009-2206": {
    "Description": "A heap buffer overflow exists in the handling of AAC or MP3 files. Opening a maliciously crafted AAC or MP3 file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Root cause": "Heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the AudioCodecs library while parsing maliciously crafted AAC or MP3 files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow",
      "Lack of bounds checking in `ACTransformerCodec::AppendInputData()`"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution or unexpected application termination.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted AAC or MP3 files.",
      "iPhone ringtones with malformed sample size table entries."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to introduce a crafted audio file to the target system, e.g. via iTunes upload.",
        "More Info": "The vulnerability exists in the `ACTransformerCodec::AppendInputData()` function of the `/System/Library/Frameworks/AudioToolbox.framework/AudioCodecs` library. The function copies data from the audio file into a heap buffer, and the size of the data is not checked against the buffer's boundaries. A loop exists that increments the index of the heap buffer without bounds checking which allows an out of bounds write if the supplied sample sizes in the audio file are malformed."
