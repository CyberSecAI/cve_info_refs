How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hash: SHA1
Advisory: Apple iPhone OS AudioCodecs Heap Buffer Overflow
Advisory ID: TKADV2009-007
Revision: 1.0
Release Date: 2009/09/09
Last Modified: 2009/09/09
Date Reported: 2009/04/05
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: iPhone OS 1.0 through 3.0.1
iPhone OS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.0
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Vendor URL: http://www.apple.com/
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2206
Patch development time: 158 days
======================
Vulnerability Details:
======================
The iPhone OS AudioCodecs library contains a heap buffer overflow
vulnerability while parsing maliciously crafted AAC or MP3 files. The
vulnerability may be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code in
the context of an application using the vulnerable library.
One attack vector are iPhone ringtones with malformed sample size table
entries. It was successfully tested that iTunes uploads such malformed
ringtones to the phone.
==================
Technical Details:
==================
Vulnerable library:
/System/Library/Frameworks/AudioToolbox.framework/AudioCodecs
Vulnerable function:
ACTransformerCodec::AppendInputData()
Disassembly of the vulnerable function:
[..]
\_\_text:3314443C LDR R3, [R5,#0xA8]
\_\_text:33144440 LDR R2, [R5,#0xA4]

[..]
[1] The values of R2 and R3 are stored into the heap buffer pointed to by
IP (R12). R2 contains user controlled data.
[2] The value of R3 gets copied into the heap buffer.
[3] R3 is filled with user controlled data from the audio file.
[4] The user controlled data of R3 gets copied into the heap buffer.
[5] The index into the heap buffer (pointed to by IP) gets incremented.
This code snippet gets executed in a loop. As there is no bounds checking
of the heap buffer pointed to by IP (R12) it is possible to cause an out of
bounds write (heap buffer overflow).
=========
Solution:
=========
Upgrade to iPhone OS 3.1 or iPhone OS 3.1.1 for iPod touch.

# About the security content of iOS 3.1 and iOS 3.1.1 for iPod touch

This document describes the security content of iOS 3.1 and iOS 3.1.1 for iPod touch.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see "[How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620)."

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see "[Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222)."

#### iOS 3.1 and iOS 3.1.1 for iPod touch

* **CoreAudio**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2206

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.0.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.0

  Impact: Opening a maliciously crafted AAC or MP3 file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in the handling of AAC or MP3 files. Opening a maliciously crafted AAC or MP3 file may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. Credit to Tobias Klein of trapkit.de for reporting this issue.

* **Exchange Support**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2794

  Available for: iOS 1.0 through 3.0.1, iOS for iPod touch 1.1 through 3.0

  Impact: A person with physical access to a device may be able to use it after the timeout period specified by an Exchange administrator

  Description: iOS provides the ability to communicate via services provided by a Microsoft Exchange server. An administrator of an Exchange server has the ability to specify a "Maximum inactivity time lock" setting. This requires the user to reenter their passcode after the expiration of the inactivity time in order to use the Exchange services. iOS allows a user to specify a "Require Passcode" setting that may extend up to 4 hours. The "Require Passcode" setting is not affected by the "Maximum inactivity time lock" setting. If the user has "Require Passcode" set to a value higher than the "Maximum inactivity time lock" setting, this would allow a window of time for a person with physical access to use the device, including Exchange services. This update addresses the issue by disabling user choices for "Require Passcode" values greater than the "Maximum inactivity time lock" setting. This issue only affects iOS 2.0 and later, and iOS for iPod touch 2.0 and later. Credit to Allan Steven, Robert Duran, Jeff Beckham of PepsiCo, Joshua Levitsky, Michael Breton of Intel Corporation, Mike Karban of Edward Jones, and Steve Moriarty of Agilent Technologies for reporting this issue.
