Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2774:

**1. Verification:**

The content from exploit-db.com directly references CVE-2009-2774 and provides details about a SQL injection vulnerability. The secunia.com content is related to vulnerability research, but does not mention this specific CVE, which means it is not useful for analysis.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `paidbanner.php` script of a "PHP Paid 4 Mail Script." The script fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the `ID` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Database Information Disclosure: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials, database structure, or other confidential data. The example exploit extracts the database user information.
    *   Potential Data Modification/Deletion: While not demonstrated in the provided exploit, SQL injection can also be used to modify or delete database records.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET Request: The attack is performed through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `paidbanner.php` script, specifically manipulating the `ID` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
    *   No Authentication: No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, as the vulnerability is in a publicly accessible script.
    *   Knowledge of the vulnerable application: An attacker needs to know the existence of the vulnerable script, and the vulnerable parameter to exploit.

**3. Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses a standard SQL injection technique, injecting `-1+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,user(),7,8,9,10--` into the `ID` parameter. This attempts to bypass the application's expected query and inject a `UNION SELECT` to extract the database username.
*   The exploit mentions that the results are reflected as "[INFORMATION SQL] was not found on this server" message in the web server's response. This indicates that there is likely no direct output of the SQL result in the main page, but the output is visible in the error messages which is an interesting characteristic of the vulnerability.

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit information is relatively old (2009), indicating the vulnerability may be in older or unmaintained versions of the PHP script.
*   The provided information is more detailed than a standard CVE description, which usually contains less granular information and does not include an example exploit.

**Summary:**

CVE-2009-2774 describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `paidbanner.php` file of a "PHP Paid 4 Mail Script". By injecting malicious SQL code via the `ID` parameter, an attacker can extract sensitive information from the database or perform other malicious actions on the database.
