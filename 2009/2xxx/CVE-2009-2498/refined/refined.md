Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2498:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the Windows Media Format Runtime processes specially crafted Advanced Systems Format (ASF) files. Specifically, the component responsible for parsing ASF files does not properly handle malformed headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of malformed headers within ASF files.
- Memory corruption due to the invalid free operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution.
- An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
- Ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with fewer rights are less impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening a specially crafted ASF file.
- Receiving specially crafted streaming content from a website or any application that delivers web content.
- The malicious file could be sent as an email attachment.
- Web-based attack, where the attacker hosts a website with malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create or obtain a specially crafted ASF file with malformed headers.
- Needs to convince a user to open the malicious file or receive malicious streaming content.
- No specific network position is mentioned, implying this can be achieved through various means.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Windows Media Format Runtime and Windows Media Services across various Windows operating systems.
- There are workarounds available by restricting access to the `wmvcore.dll` file, but this limits the functionality of playing media files.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way Windows Media Format Runtime parses ASF files.
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed prior to the release of the security bulletin.
- There were no reports of active exploitation at the time of the initial security bulletin release.
- Internet Explorer's Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Server 2003 and 2008 provides mitigation for web-based attacks.
