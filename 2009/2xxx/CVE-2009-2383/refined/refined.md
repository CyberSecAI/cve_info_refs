Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-2383

**Vulnerable Software:** WordPress Plugin Related Sites 2.1

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `BTE_RW_webajax.php` file of the plugin, where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization. Specifically the `guid` parameter from `$_POST`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The code directly uses the `$_POST['guid']` parameter in an SQL `INSERT` statement. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. Because this is a blind SQL injection the attacker cannot directly see the output of the SQL query, but can infer the result by changes in timing or other responses from the server.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize or validate the `guid` parameter before using it in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Access:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database. The provided exploit demonstrates how to extract user credentials (`user_login`, `user_pass`, `user_nicename`, `user_email`) from the `wp_users` table.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers may be able to modify or delete data in the database.
*  **Complete System Compromise:** With full database access, the attacker can potentially compromise the entire WordPress installation by creating admin users, adding backdoors, or other malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted POST request to the `BTE_RW_webajax.php` file. The attacker manipulates the `guid` parameter.
*   **HTTP_REFERER header is also required but does not need to be malicious**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to know that the specific plugin is installed and vulnerable.
*   **Basic Web Skills:** Ability to send HTTP POST requests.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** Understanding of SQL syntax to craft injection payloads.

**Exploit Details:**

The provided exploit uses the following payload for the `guid` parameter:

```
0', (select concat_ws(0x3a,user_login,user_pass,user_nicename,user_email) from wp_users where ID>0 and user_status=0 limit 1 ) );--
```
This payload is designed to extract user information from the `wp_users` table and insert it into the database.

The `click` and `HTTP_REFERER` parameters can have arbitrary values.
