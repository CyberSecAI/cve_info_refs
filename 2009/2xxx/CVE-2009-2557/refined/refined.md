Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `download.php` script of the Admin News Tools 2.5 application. Specifically, the script directly uses user-supplied input from the `fichier` GET parameter in the `readfile()` function without any validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is a remote file disclosure. Attackers can manipulate the `fichier` parameter to access and download arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that are accessible to the web server process. This is achieved through path traversal using `../` sequences.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate or sanitize the user-provided `fichier` parameter, making it susceptible to path traversal attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially download sensitive configuration files, source code, database connection strings, and other files containing confidential data, which could lead to further compromise of the system and the application.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Disclosure of sensitive information could be used to identify additional vulnerabilities and conduct further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `download.php` script with a malicious `fichier` parameter containing path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of Path Traversal:** The attacker needs an understanding of path traversal techniques to craft a malicious `fichier` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is present in the `download.php` file with the following code:
```php
header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=' . basename ($_GET['fichier']));
readfile($_GET['fichier']);
```
This code takes the `fichier` parameter from the URL, attempts to generate a filename for the download, and then directly uses this parameter with `readfile()`, which is susceptible to a path traversal attack.

**Example Attack:**
`http://www.site.com/news/system/download.php?fichier=./../up.php`
This example would try to access the `up.php` file in a directory above the `download.php` script.
