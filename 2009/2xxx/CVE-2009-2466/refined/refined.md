## Analysis of CVE-2009-2466

Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2466:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the Mozilla JavaScript engine's handling of certain object properties, specifically within the `JS_HashTableRawLookup` function and related areas like `XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper`, `getter`, and `toSource`. The vulnerability occurs when a wrapped object with getters is encountered during sharp-marking traversal (used for garbage collection).

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Handling of Wrapped Getters:** The code incorrectly invokes getters on wrapped objects instead of just registering them in the hash table during the sharp-marking process. This leads to a re-entrant call to MarkSharpObjects before the map->depth can be decremented.
*   **Double-Free Vulnerability:** Due to the re-entrant call and the improper handling of depth, the newly created hash table could be destroyed prematurely causing a double free and a crash.
*   **Stack Corruption:** In some cases, this issue can lead to stack corruption which could potentially cause more issues.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A primary impact is a crash in the JavaScript engine, resulting in a denial of service. The crash occurs within the `JS_HashTableRawLookup` function.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Some of the reports indicate that with enough effort, this memory corruption could potentially be exploited to run arbitrary code.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Pages with Malicious JavaScript:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious web page crafted with JavaScript code that triggers the vulnerability.
*  **Specific JavaScript Constructs**: The vulnerability is triggered when a JavaScript code calls toSource on an array containing wrapped objects which invoke getters.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Web Content:** An attacker needs the capability to serve or inject malicious HTML and JavaScript content to a victim's browser
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable JavaScript Constructs**: An attacker needs to know the specific JavaScript patterns that exploit the vulnerable code paths.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during a garbage collection cycle when sharp-marking is enabled.
*   The issue is associated with `XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper` which is accessible to content, where wrapped getters can start a sharp-marking traversal themselves.
*   The initial test case involved an HTML page which caused a crash within the function `JS_HashTableRawLookup`
*   The fix involves incrementing depth across property gets and making sure MarkSharpObjects asserts that map->depth >= 1
*   The fix also includes changes to protect the `sharpObjectMap` in the presence of wrapped getters by protecting the `map->depth` in the presence of wrapped getters.

**Relevant Code Snippets:**
