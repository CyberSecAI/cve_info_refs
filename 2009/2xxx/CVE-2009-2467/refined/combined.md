| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=512136#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-07-16 14:14:13 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Peter Van der Beken, Mike Shaver, Jesse Ruderman, Jeff Walden and Carsten Book reported crashes in the Firefox 3 JavaScript engine.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=512136#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-22 01:26:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1162 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1162.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=512136#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-22 01:30:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1163 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1163.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=512136#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-07-22 18:50:11 UTC  ``` MITRE"s [CVE-2009-2466](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-2466) entry:  The JavaScript engine in Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.12 and Thunderbird allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to (1) nsDOMClassInfo.cpp, (2) JS_HashTableRawLookup, and (3) MirrorWrappedNativeParent and js_LockGCThingRT.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=493601#c0)• 16 years ago |
|  | |

Attila Suszter reported this crash and proof-of-concept to security@m.o.. It appears to be caused by navigating the page and therefore unloading the Flash player while a dialog presented by the Flash player is still visible.
It helped me to increase the meta-refresh time in index.html to a higher number so the dialog has time to appear. I don't have a Windows debug build available, so I wasn't able to provide more information about the call stack leading to the crash. I'll attach the PoC momentarily.
Possibly related to [bug 470487](/show_bug.cgi?id=470487 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox Crash [@ nsWindow::GetParentWindow(int)] & [@ nsBaseWidget::Destroy()]?")?

Confirming the crash on a 1.9.1 debug build. The stack trace is pretty worthless though at the time of the crash.

Hmm, this is exactly what the code that Mats Palmgren added at <http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/4a32b3101121/layout/generic/nsObjectFrame.cpp#l1975> was to protect against. The plugin in question at the time that code was added was the Real plugin IIRC.

That's the same code in question for [bug 470487](/show_bug.cgi?id=470487 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox Crash [@ nsWindow::GetParentWindow(int)] & [@ nsBaseWidget::Destroy()]?"), right?

(In reply to [comment #4](/show_bug.cgi?id=493601#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Investigate crash involving Flash module unloading"))
> That's the same code in question for [bug 470487](/show_bug.cgi?id=470487 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox Crash [@ nsWindow::GetParentWindow(int)] & [@ nsBaseWidget::Destroy()]?"), right?
The code that landed in [bug 420886](/show_bug.cgi?id=420886 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash when reloading page with RealPlayer plugin that has modal child window") caused some of the problems I found while testing on 470487. However, I never reproduced the exact same stack so I can't say for sure that the original crash in 470487 was caused by that patch.
This crash happens with and without the patch in 420886.
Brandon, can you provide some details on what this flash app is doing?

I decompiled the Flash app and pulled out ~200K of JavaScript. It wasn't obvious what it was trying to do. There is a lot of code from libraries like Google Analytics, but perhaps those were just used as a starting basis for fuzzing.
Perhaps Attila (the reporter) can shed some light on what the Flash is doing here.

It looks like the script warning dialog gets created during tear down, after our delayed shutdown code executes and the real tear down begins. Also, the parent on the dialog points to the main fx frame. I added a bit of code in our wm\_destroy event handler to enumerate child windows and found that there were none.

I don't think the code in the flash really matters, it's just a lot of library code so Flash will throw up its "slow script" modal dialog.

Attached patch

[wm\_user bounce patch v.1](attachment.cgi?id=380268&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=380268&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=493601&attachment=380268)

The event loop depth tracking we added works well for tracking depth for native events, but in this one case we are processing the user+1 events through a runnable. The thread that delivered these was both responsible for running the freezing script and generating the script warning dialog all in one shot. When we come around to destroy the plug-in, the event loop depth hasn't changed, so we go ahead and destroyed all the plug-in resources. The crash was occuring as the thread unwound.
This just bounces these events through the native event processing unwinding the stack. It shouldn't alter the timing of the overall stream of user events.

wm\_user bounce patch v.1
So I'm not technically a windows/widget peer, you'd probably get better help from Ere Maijala (ere). Nevertheless this patch is pretty simple.
>+static UINT sWM\_CUSTOMMSG = 0;
I'd give this a better name, something that describes a little about what it means.
>+ if (msg == sWM\_CUSTOMMSG) {
I'd move this block into ProcessFlashMessageDelayed since it's really part of the same machinery.
And even though it seems impossible I'd assert that sWM\_CUSTOMMSG != 0 here since that's technically WM\_NULL and a valid message.
>+ sWM\_CUSTOMMSG = ::RegisterWindowMessage(NS\_PLUGIN\_CUSTOM\_MSG\_ID);
The MSDN docs have this to say about RegisterWindowMessage:
Only use RegisterWindowMessage when more than one application must process the
same message. For sending private messages within a window class, an
application can use any integer in the range WM\_USER through 0x7FFF.
I know that plugins mess this pretty picture up a little, but are there no WM\_USER messages reserved for the browser in plugin land?
>+ if (GetMsg() == WM\_USER+1) {
If we're going to hardcode WM\_USER+1 in more than one place it might be better to #define it somewhere with a name that makes sense. Some part of me thinks that it's a bad idea to add little hacks like this to something that is supposed to be generic (PluginWindowEvent) but then I remember that this is in the plugin code and the argument is ridiculous on its face ;-)

Anything seems possible, hence my reason for using this. It assures a unique message value system wide. Different instances will get the same value back registered under the string identifier, so system resource use will be minimal.

It's a fix for a hack that is quite old which addresses a new problem brought on by some rather invasive code that landed a while back. For the release at least it's the simplest solution. The user flooding problem probably deserves some new investigation. That kind of work doesn't fit into the time frame we have here though AFAICT.
Will post an update here shortly.

I'd prefer to leave that as is, there's no harm in being explicit in the initial value.

Historically, and still AFAIK, there is harm in a small way: explicit initializers, even 0, besides being needlessly verbose (explicitness here only helps readers who don't know C/C++ rules), puts the variable in initialized data instead of BSS ("Blank Starting Storage" or variations; not sure what the original acronym was). This takes up space in the executable.

I have no objection to this though I'm inexperienced with win32. It would be great if we could get emaijala to review.
Is this something we should get Adobe to address? If so lets file a bug on that and get in touch with the right people so we can eventually remove any fix on our end ASAP.

It's part of their implementation, they use user messages internally as some sort of primary timing / functionality pump mechanism. There's nothing wrong with doing this, it has more to do with these events getting fed through our event processing system.
The original fix landed about nine years ago. (See [bug 132759](/show_bug.cgi?id=132759 "VERIFIED FIXED - [HANG]high(100%) cpu usage with Flash: WM_USER+1 events given too high priority and starve UI")) Personally I've never seen flooding of our our event queue from these events but I'm on a fairly fast system. That might not be the case for systems that are resource starved. We might kick off a bug to investigate whether or not the original fix is needed anymore.

As stated at the top of the Firefox3.0 tinderbox page, "Bugs must have approval1.9.0.12+ from the 1.9.0-branch triage team". This has always been the case for stable branches.

Renominating for blocking 1.9.1. Since we're fixing topcrashers in the RC, it might be worth taking this as well. We also plan to fix it in 1.9.0.12, which will be out shortly after 1.9.1 ships.
The topcrash part of this was "fixed" in [bug 470487](/show_bug.cgi?id=470487 "VERIFIED FIXED - Firefox Crash [@ nsWindow::GetParentWindow(int)] & [@ nsBaseWidget::Destroy()]?"), but that wasn't the real fix since it's still a topcrash (#4 in Firefox 3.5 RC).Flags: blocking1.9.1- → blocking1.9.1?

Obviously since you nominated it you've got a firm sense of potential for regression, right? Or a good set of tests we can run things through to make sure we don't regress it further?

I really don't see much risk in this. My only concern are the added events running through our native event process which might cause some sort of performance issue. (It doesn't appear we've had any issues on trunk.)
The other question is whether or not this is a valid security risk. There was a bunch of "spray heap" type code in the script that came with the poc that I was never entirely sure would actually be effective. The crash was from a stack unwind in a plugin event procedure, how script running in the page could leverage that is not clear to me. Someone who understands js interaction in that case could probably shed better light on it.
The crash occurs in a corner case where we have a slow script warning in the flash plugin (user content related issue) with an unload of the page using script in the html. That to me seems like something authors could avoid. If there's no legitimate security issue here, then I would say skipping 1.9.1 would be ok. We could let it bake on trunk for a while and land it for the first 3.5 update.

Any ideas on how we can reproduce? Do you have a crash stack?
All I have to go on is my own testing and the verified 1.9.0.12 Al provided. I tested it again a few times this morning with no problems. QA should also try and verify as well.

I was not able to make it crash, on repeated attempts. After I open the index.html file in the PoC, the browser becomes unresponsive momentarily, and then an Adobe Flash Player dialog comes up saying: "A script in this movie is causing Adobe Flash Player 10 to run slowly..."
If I click Yes to stop the script I'm back to normal, and if I click No, it hangs momentarily and then the dialog comes up again. But no crash. 3.5 crashes consistently, on the other hand.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Mozilla Firefox Browser in SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 Service Pack 2
was brought from the old 2.0.0.x release branch to the current 3.0.12
release of the Firefox 3.0 release branch.
It contains the following new security fixes:
MFSA 2009-34 / CVE-2009-2462 / CVE-2009-2463 / CVE-2009-2464 /
CVE-2009-2465 / CVE-2009-2466:
Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed
several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and
other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence
of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that
with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.
MFSA 2009-35 / CVE-2009-2467:
Security researcher Attila Suszter reported that when a page contains
a Flash object which presents a slow script dialog, and the page is
navigated while the dialog is still visible to the user, the Flash
plugin is unloaded resulting in a crash due to a call to the deleted
object. This crash could potentially be used by an attacker to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2009-36 / CVE-2009-1194:
oCERT security researcher Will Drewry reported a series of heap
and integer overflow vulnerabilities which independently affected
multiple font glyph rendering libraries. On Linux platforms libpango
was susceptible to the vulnerabilities while on OS X CoreGraphics was
similarly vulnerable. An attacker could trigger these overflows by
constructing a very large text run for the browser to display. Such an
overflow can result in a crash which the attacker could potentially
use to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer. The open-source
nature of Linux meant that Mozilla was able to work with the libpango
maintainers to implement the correct fix in version 1.24 of that
system library which was distributed with OS security updates. On
Mac OS X Firefox works around the CoreGraphics flaw by limiting the
length of text runs passed to the system.
MFSA 2009-37 / CVE-2009-2469:
Security researcher PenPal reported a crash involving a SVG element on
which a watch function and \_\_defineSetter\_\_ function have been set for
a particular property. The crash showed evidence of memory corruption
and could potentially be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code
MFSA 2009-39 / CVE-2009-2471:
Mozilla developer Blake Kaplan reported that setTimeout, when called
with certain object parameters which should be protected with a
XPCNativeWrapper, will fail to keep the object wrapped when compiling
the new function to be executed. If chrome privileged code were
to call setTimeout using this as an argument, the this object will
lose its wrapper and could be unsafely accessed by chrome code. An
attacker could use such vulnerable code to run arbitrary JavaScript
with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2009-40 / CVE-2009-2472:
Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a series
of vulnerabilities in which objects that normally receive a
XPCCrossOriginWrapper are constructed without the wrapper. This
can lead to cases where JavaScript from one website may unsafely
access properties of such an object which had been set by a different
website. A malicious website could use this vulnerability to launch
a XSS attack and run arbitrary JavaScript within the context of
another site.
The update also contains a set of GTK2+ and dependend libraries
necessary for this version upgrade.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart all running Firefox instances after the update.
This update is not yet available on S/390 64bit, this will be delivered
with the upcoming 3.0.13 update.
Due to a unclear SUN Java bug Firefox will not start on the first try,
but only on the second.
This update also requires a fixed yast2-registration, otherwise further
registration tasks will not open a webbrowser. It is available with
this update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=512137#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-07-16 14:16:09 UTC  ``` Security researcher Attila Suszter reported that when a page contains a Flash object which presents a slow script dialog, and the page is navigated while the dialog is still visible to the user, the Flash plugin is unloaded resulting in a crash due to a call to the deleted object. This crash could potentially be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=512137#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-22 01:26:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1162 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1162.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=512137#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-07-22 18:51:50 UTC  ``` MITRE's [CVE-2009-2467](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-2467) entry:  Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.12 and 3.5 before 3.5.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a Flash object, a slow script dialog, and the unloading of the Flash plugin, which triggers attempted use of a deleted object.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The MozillaFirefox 3.0.12 release fixes various bugs and some critical
security issues.
MFSA 2009-34 / CVE-2009-2462 / CVE-2009-2463 / CVE-2009-2464 /
CVE-2009-2465 / CVE-2009-2466:
Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed
several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and
other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence
of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that
with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.
MFSA 2009-35 / CVE-2009-2467:
Security researcher Attila Suszter reported that when a page contains
a Flash object which presents a slow script dialog, and the page is
navigated while the dialog is still visible to the user, the Flash
plugin is unloaded resulting in a crash due to a call to the deleted
object. This crash could potentially be used by an attacker to run
arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2009-36 / CVE-2009-1194:
oCERT security researcher Will Drewry reported a series of heap
and integer overflow vulnerabilities which independently affected
multiple font glyph rendering libraries. On Linux platforms libpango
was susceptible to the vulnerabilities while on OS X CoreGraphics was
similarly vulnerable. An attacker could trigger these overflows by
constructing a very large text run for the browser to display. Such an
overflow can result in a crash which the attacker could potentially
use to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer. The open-source
nature of Linux meant that Mozilla was able to work with the libpango
maintainers to implement the correct fix in version 1.24 of that
system library which was distributed with OS security updates. On
Mac OS X Firefox works around the CoreGraphics flaw by limiting the
length of text runs passed to the system.
MFSA 2009-37 / CVE-2009-2469:
Security researcher PenPal reported a crash involving a SVG element on
which a watch function and \_\_defineSetter\_\_ function have been set for
a particular property. The crash showed evidence of memory corruption
and could potentially be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code
on a victim's computer.
MFSA 2009-39 / CVE-2009-2471:
Mozilla developer Blake Kaplan reported that setTimeout, when called
with certain object parameters which should be protected with a
XPCNativeWrapper, will fail to keep the object wrapped when compiling
the new function to be executed. If chrome privileged code were
to call setTimeout using this as an argument, the this object will
lose its wrapper and could be unsafely accessed by chrome code. An
attacker could use such vulnerable code to run arbitrary JavaScript
with chrome privileges.
MFSA 2009-40 / CVE-2009-2472:
Mozilla security researcher moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported a series
of vulnerabilities in which objects that normally receive a
XPCCrossOriginWrapper are constructed without the wrapper. This
can lead to cases where JavaScript from one website may unsafely
access properties of such an object which had been set by a different
website. A malicious website could use this vulnerability to launch
a XSS attack and run arbitrary JavaScript within the context of
another site.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of Firefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=512142#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-07-16 14:21:31 UTC  ``` Security researcher PenPal reported a crash involving a SVG element on which a watch function and __defineSetter__ function have been set for a particular property. The crash showed evidence of memory corruption and could potentially be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=512142#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-07-22 01:26:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1162 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1162.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=512142#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-07-22 18:54:40 UTC  ``` MITRE's [CVE-2009-2469](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-2469) entry:  Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.12 does not properly handle an SVG element that has a property with a watch function and an __defineSetter__ function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted document, related to a certain pointer misinterpretation.

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2009-2462, CVE-2009-2463, CVE-2009-2464, CVE-2009-2465, CVE-2009-2466,
CVE-2009-2467, CVE-2009-2469, CVE-2009-2471)

Several flaws were found in the way Firefox handles malformed JavaScript
code. A website containing malicious content could launch a cross-site
scripting (XSS) attack or execute arbitrary JavaScript with the permissions
of another website. (CVE-2009-2472)

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-35

## Crash and remote code execution during Flash player unloading

Announced
July 21, 2009
Reporter
Attila Suszter
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.12
* Firefox 3.5.1

### Description

Security researcher **Attila Suszter** reported that
when a page contains a Flash object which presents a slow script
dialog, and the page is navigated while the dialog is still visible to
the user, the Flash plugin is unloaded resulting in a crash due to a
call to the deleted object. This crash could potentially be used by
an attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
