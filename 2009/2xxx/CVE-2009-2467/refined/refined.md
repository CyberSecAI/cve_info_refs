{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs when a page containing a Flash object presents a slow script dialog, and the user navigates away from the page while the dialog is still visible. This causes the Flash plugin to be unloaded while a call to a deleted object is still pending, resulting in a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of plugin unloading during active dialogs",
      "Use of a deleted object"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service (application crash) and potentially achieve remote code execution by crafting malicious web content.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious webpage with embedded Flash content designed to trigger a slow script dialog",
       "Navigating away from the page while the dialog is still displayed"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content into a website viewed by the victim, and relies on user interaction (navigating away from a page with a specific flash dialog)"
  }
