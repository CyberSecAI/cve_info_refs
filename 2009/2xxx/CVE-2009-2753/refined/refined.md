{
  "CVE-2009-2753": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of both IBM Informix Dynamic Server. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaws exist within the RPC protocol parsing library, librpc.dll, utilized by the ISM Portmapper service (portmap.exe) bound by default to TCP port 36890. During authentication, a lack of proper sanity checking on supplied parameter sizes can result in exploitable stack and heap based buffer overflows leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
    "Root cause": "Lack of proper sanity checking on supplied parameter sizes during authentication in the RPC protocol parsing library.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM user privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network. The vulnerability is triggered through network communication with the vulnerable service, specifically TCP port 36890, which is used by the ISM Portmapper service.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker can remotely exploit this vulnerability without authentication, implying no special access or privileges are required other than network accessibility to the vulnerable service."
