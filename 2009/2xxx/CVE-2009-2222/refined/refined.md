Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-2222:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal flaw present in the PHP-I-BOARD software provided by Let's PHP!.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when accessing files. This allows an attacker to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to navigate outside the intended directory and access sensitive files on the server. This is also described as CWE-22 (Path Traversal).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files on the server by exploiting the path traversal vulnerability. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including configuration files, source code, or user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability via HTTP requests by crafting malicious URLs containing directory traversal sequences.
- **No Authentication Required**: The attack can be carried out without any authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server running PHP-I-BOARD.
- No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- Basic knowledge of HTTP requests and directory traversal techniques.

**Additional details from jvn.jp and jvndb.jvn.jp:**
- The affected software is PHP-I-BOARD v1.2 and earlier versions.
- JPCERT/CC analysis rated the attack vector as "High," meaning it can be exploited from the internet without authentication or user interaction.
- CVSS v2 score: 5.0 (Medium severity). The vector is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N, meaning Network, Low complexity, No authentication, Partial Confidentiality Impact, No Integrity impact, No Availability Impact.
- The vulnerability was reported by Masaya Ohno.
- The JVN entry also includes a link to the vendor's site for PHP-I-BOARD.
