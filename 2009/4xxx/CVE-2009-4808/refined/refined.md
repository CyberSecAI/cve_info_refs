Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure to sanitize user-supplied input in multiple PHP files (`index.php`, `admin.php`, and `view.php`), leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the application directly incorporates GET parameters into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks in the `index.php` and `view.php` files via the `c` and `id` GET parameters, respectively.
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application sets an administrative cookie (`g_admin`) with a hardcoded value and expiry, which could be easily manipulated by an attacker via JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:**  Attackers can leverage SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, email addresses (as demonstrated by the provided exploit code using `concat(id,password,email)`).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The insecure cookie handling could potentially allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to administrative functionalities by setting a valid `g_admin` cookie.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** SQL injection could be further exploited for unauthorized data modification or deletion.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** If the system's database is compromised with an SQL injection attack, it can be leveraged for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET parameters:** Vulnerable GET parameters (`c` in `index.php`, `id` in `view.php`).
*   **Client-side JavaScript manipulation:** Modifying the browser's cookie to set the `g_admin` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*  The attacker could be unauthenticated and still exploit the cookie manipulation weakness.

**Additional Details (beyond CVE description):**
*   The exploit-db entry provides specific URLs and SQL injection payloads, making the attack vector clear and readily usable.
*   The vulnerable software is "Graugon PHP Article Publisher 1.0".
*   The exploit-db entry identifies two CVEs: CVE-2009-4808 and CVE-2009-4807, though only the first one is being analyzed.
* The `setcookie()` function on line 20 and line 27 also presents the additional insecure cookie handling weakness.
* The content also provides a description and information of the Exploit-DB.

In summary, this vulnerability arises from a lack of input validation and insecure cookie management in "Graugon PHP Article Publisher 1.0"
