  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Blind SQL injection",
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database via blind SQL injection and execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser using XSS.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a crafted `campaign_id` parameter for SQL injection.",
     "HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a crafted parameter for XSS."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
