Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Default, weak passwords:** IntelliCom NetBiter devices ship with default, well-known passwords for the HICP (HMS Industrial Communication Protocol) network configuration service.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The NetBiter configuration tool (NetBiterConfig.exe) has a stack buffer overflow vulnerability when parsing the hostname from an HICP response due to using `strcpy` instead of `strncpy`, allowing for writing past the buffer's boundary on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Default Credentials:** The use of default HICP passwords allows unauthorized access to device configuration.
*   **Plaintext transmission:** HICP transmits passwords in plaintext, allowing for eavesdropping.
*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function in NetBiterConfig.exe copies a hostname from the HICP response without any bounds checking, leading to a stack buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Attackers can change network settings, potentially disrupting legitimate users' access to the HICP service and the device itself.
*   **Password Disclosure:** Due to plaintext transmission, attackers can monitor HICP communications and capture the passwords.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious HICP response with an oversized hostname, an attacker can trigger a stack buffer overflow in the NetBiter configuration tool, leading to arbitrary code execution on the administrator's machine when they attempt to configure the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the NetBiter devices and the administrator's machine to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   **HICP Communication:** The attack is carried out using the HICP protocol to send specially crafted messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the targeted NetBiter devices.
*   **HICP Knowledge:** The attacker must understand the HICP protocol.
*   **Man-in-the-middle/spoofing (for RCE):** For the remote code execution vulnerability, the attacker may need to be able to inject malicious HICP responses into the network to target an administrator's machine. They would need to spoof a device on the network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in IntelliCom's NetBiter devices and their configuration tool but not in the original HMS software, as they used `strncpy` instead of `strcpy`.
*   The vulnerable software is the NetBiter Configuration tool, not the device firmware.
*   The blog post provides a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) script demonstrating how to exploit the stack overflow vulnerability for RCE using a crafted hostname.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Rub√©n Santamarta and publicly disclosed on 2009-12-12, but the vendor, Intellicom, addressed it later.
*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2009-4463.
