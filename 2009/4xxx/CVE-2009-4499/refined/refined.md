Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `get_history_lastid()` function in the Zabbix Server. This function constructs and executes a SQL query using user-controlled arguments within a `SELECT MAX(...) FROM ...` statement. The nodewatcher component calls this function to check for necessary data synchronization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterization when constructing the SQL query.  The user-provided arguments are directly incorporated into the query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by remote, unauthenticated users, due to no server-side restriction on the caller.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** An attacker can execute any SQL query against the Zabbix server's database.
- **Data Breach:** This could lead to the extraction of sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data, potentially disrupting Zabbix server operations and data integrity.
- **Server Compromise:** In severe cases, SQL injection might lead to system-level access or further server compromise.
- **Result Disclosure:** The result of the injected query is sent back to the attacker, which provides a powerful attack vector.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the Zabbix Server on the network.
- **Nodewatcher component interaction:** By invoking the vulnerable function which uses user-controlled data, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must have network access to the Zabbix Server.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to the Zabbix server in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested on Zabbix versions 1.6.1 and 1.6.5.
- The vulnerability has been addressed in Zabbix versions 1.6.7 and 1.9.0 (alpha).
- The provided content suggests it is a non-typical SQL injection because quoting variables cannot help, likely suggesting the injection point is in a position where string escaping/quoting would not be a defense.
- The `zbx-sqli-v2.py` script was attached as a proof of concept, further indicating an easily exploitable vulnerability.
