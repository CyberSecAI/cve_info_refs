Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4363:

*   **Vulnerability:** XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
*   **Affected Software:** Horde Groupware, Horde Application Framework, and Horde Groupware Webmail Edition.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of HTML messages, specifically within the `href` attribute of `<a>` tags and potentially other areas. Attackers can inject malicious `data:` URIs containing JavaScript within these attributes.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious link containing a `data:` URI with embedded JavaScript (e.g., `data:text/html;base64,...`), an attacker could execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser when the victim views the link.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to stealing sensitive information (e.g., session cookies), defacing the web page, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.
*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   Horde Groupware 1.2.4 and earlier
    *   Horde Application Framework 3.3.5 and earlier
    *   Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 1.2.4 and earlier
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is addressed by:
    *   Improved XSS filtering within the Horde framework. Specifically, the fix involves stripping out HTML data within the `href` element. The patch provided modifies the `Horde_Text_Filter_Xss` class to remove `data:` URIs within the `href` attribute of `<a>` tags.
*   **Location of Fix:**
    *   `framework/Text_Filter/lib/Horde/Text/Filter/Xss.php`

The information available also indicates that the XSS filter was improved to work around an XSS vulnerability in Firefox browsers.
