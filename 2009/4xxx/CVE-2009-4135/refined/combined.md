build: distcheck: do not leave a $TMPDIR/coreutils directory behind\* dist-check.mk (tmpdir): Rename from TMPDIR. Use ./tests/torture
unconditionally, rather than $TMPDIR-with-default-to-/tmp.
Otherwise, running "make distcheck" could leave an empty /tmp/coreutils
directory behind.
(tp): Simplify, now that it's always in the build-dir.
(taint-distcheck): Set HOME earlier, in case $(MAKE) misbehaves.
(my-instcheck, coreutils-path-check): Add diagnostics, so it's easier
to diagnose when each runs.
(coreutils-path-check): Run configure with --quiet, to reduce output.
Inspired by Ralf Wildenhues' report of /tmp/coreutils being left behind.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

aka, <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/commit/?id=ae034822c535fa5>

Now that there's a public BZ mentioning the security impact,
<http://bugzilla.redhat.com/545439>, I will note that the above
change also fixes a security-related flaw.  Any user running
"make distcheck" with TMPDIR unset or set to a world-writable
directory like /tmp, is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.

So either don't run "make distcheck", with coreutils-8.1 or earlier,
or be sure that TMPDIR is not a world-writable directory.

I'll add something like the above to NEWS.

# USN-2473-1: coreutils vulnerabilities

14 January 2015

date and touch could be made to crash or run programs if they
handled specially crafted input.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [coreutils](/security/cves?package=coreutils) - GNU core utilities

## Details

It was discovered that the distcheck rule in dist-check.mk in GNU

coreutils allows local users to gain privileges via a symlink attack

on a directory tree under /tmp. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2009-4135](/security/CVE-2009-4135))

Bertrand Jacquin and Fiedler Roman discovered date and touch incorrectly

handled user-supplied input. An attacker could possibly use this to cause

a denial of service or potentially execute code. ([CVE-2014-9471](/security/CVE-2014-9471))

Subject: CVE Request -- coreutils -- unsafe temporary directory location use

Hi Steve, vendors,

   Jim Meyering reported a flaw in coreutils in the way, its
"distcheck" Makefile rule used to set up a temporary directory
location to be used later for performing its own tasks.
This might allow local attacker to conduct symlink attacks or
potentially execute arbitrary code under certain circumstances.

Upstream patch:
--------------
<http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/commit/?id=ae034822c535fa5>

Affected versions:
------------------
coreutils-5.2.1 through to coreutils-8.1

References:
-----------

<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.coreutils.bugs/19199>

Could you allocate a CVE identifier for this issue?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
