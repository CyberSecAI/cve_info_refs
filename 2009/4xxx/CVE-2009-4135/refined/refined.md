Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-4135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `distcheck` make rule in GNU coreutils versions 5.2.1 through 8.1 used a predictable temporary directory location within the system's `/tmp` directory when running "make distcheck". This predictable location allowed for a race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The `distcheck` target in the `dist-check.mk` file created temporary directories and files with predictable names in `/tmp`.
- **Race Condition:** A malicious local user could exploit this predictability by creating a symbolic link (symlink) with the same name in `/tmp` as the directory or file the build process would create and cause the build process to operate on a different directory than intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Local Privilege Escalation**: A malicious local user can perform symlink attacks against the predictable directory structure to trick the `make distcheck` process. This could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user executing `make distcheck`.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a malicious user with local access to the system.
- **`make distcheck` command:** The attack is triggered by running `make distcheck` in the coreutils source directory
- **World-writable TMPDIR:** The vulnerability is exacerbated when the `TMPDIR` environment variable is either unset or points to a world-writable directory like `/tmp`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the system where the vulnerable coreutils is installed.
- **Ability to Create Symlinks:**  The attacker must be able to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
- **Awareness of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware that the user might run the vulnerable `make distcheck` command.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in coreutils-7.0 and fixed by commit `ae034822c535fa5`.
- The fix involves modifying `dist-check.mk` to use a temporary directory within the build directory instead of a predictable location in `/tmp`.
- This issue does *not* affect users using binary RPMs or rebuilding source RPMs (distcheck target is not used during the SRPM build). It affects users directly running `make distcheck` from a source tree.
