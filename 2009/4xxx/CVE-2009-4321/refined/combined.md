How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [AcuSensor, curl and Zen Cart](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/news/acusensor-curl-and-zen-cart/)

![](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/22141821/image5.jpg)

Recently we’ve released a new build, build number [20091124](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/productnews/acunetix-wvs-version-6-5-build-20091124-released/). This build includes a new [AcuSensor](https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/rightwvs/) check named “curl\_exec() url is controlled by user”. This new check will verify if the user can control the URL passed to **curl\_exec**.

In case you are not familiar with **curl**, below is a short abstract about curl taken from [PHP’s manual](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.curl.php):

> *PHP supports libcurl, a library created by Daniel Stenberg, that allows you to connect and communicate to many different types of servers with many different types of protocols. libcurl currently supports the http, https, ftp, gopher, telnet, dict, file, and ldap protocols. libcurl also supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading (this can also be done with PHP’s ftp extension), HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, and user+password authentication.*

Usually, curl is used to connect and retrieve data from a remote URL using the http protocol. However, curl supports a bunch of protocols as you can see in the description above. One of these protocols is the **file** protocol. Using this protocol you can read local files by using an URL like **file:///etc/passwd**. Therefore, if the user can control the URL passed to curl\_exec, in some cases (if the content is echoed back) it can read local files.

While testing this new AcuSensor check on different applications, I’ve found a real-life example of a vulnerable application.  I’m talking about [Zen Cart](http://www.zen-cart.com/).  Acunetix WVS issued the following alert:

![curl_exec_zen_cart](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2009/12/curl_exec_zen_cart.png "curl_exec_zen_cart")

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Cart):

> **Zen Cart** is an open source online store management system. It is PHP-based, using a MySQL database and HTML components. Support is provided for several languages and currencies, and it is freely available under the GNU General Public License.

Zen Cart contains a directory named **extras** where there are different test scripts. One of these scripts is **curltest.php**. This script is used for testing is the curl PHP library is installed and is working properly.

The source code of this script looks like this (only relevant pieces of code are shown):

![zen_cart_code](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2009/12/zen_cart_code.png "zen_cart_code")

As you can see above, the URL passed to the curl\_setopt (CURLOPT\_URL) function and later used by curl\_exec comes from user input ($\_GET[‘url’]).

Also, the file contents (saved in the $result) are echoed back to the user. Therefore we cane read the contents of any file from the remote server.

![zen_cart_curl_etc_passwd](https://cdn.acunetix.com/wp_content/uploads/2009/12/zen_cart_curl_etc_passwd1.png "zen_cart_curl_etc_passwd")

As you can see in the screenshot above, it’s possible to read the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

However, the extras directory contains other test scripts. One of them, named **ipn\_test\_return.php**, is not properly written and will display an error message when called directly:

If you issue a request like http://bld02:80/zen-cart/extras/ipn\_test\_return.php

you will receive the following error message:

<br />

<b>Fatal error</b>: require() [<a href=’function.require’>function.require</a>]: Failed opening required ‘includes/application\_top.php’ (include\_path=’.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear’) in <b>/var/www/bld/bld02/zen-cart/extras/ipn\_test\_return.php</b> on line <b>14</b><br />

This error message reveals the local path, so now we know where the application is installed. This could be useful to read the contents of the configuration file (includes/configure.php). This file contains the database credentials. If the Zen Cart database is not stored on the local server, it’s possible to access the database remotely.

Also, even without the file:// protocol, it’s possible to access hosts behind the firewall by issuing requests like

http://bld02/zen-cart/extras/curltest.php?url=http://192.168.0.1 or

http://bld02/zen-cart/extras/curltest.php?url=http://192.168.1.1.

The vendor released a security alert after being notified by us. They advise users to completely remove the extras directory as it’s not required by Zen Cart and it was distributed only for troubleshooting.

The security alert can be found [here](http://www.zen-cart.com/forum/showthread.php?t=142784).
