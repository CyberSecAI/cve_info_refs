The provided content details vulnerabilities in Power Phlogger, a web statistics application, specifically versions 2.2.5 and earlier. It describes two types of vulnerabilities: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Full Path Disclosure.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient sanitization/filtering of user-supplied input within the application. Specifically, the page URL and parameters are not properly sanitized before being included in the logs, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Persistent XSS:** On the `dspStats.php?edit=mp` page, the application does not filter information about pages visited, which are stored in logs. An attacker can inject JavaScript code as a URL, which will be stored and executed when the logs are viewed. This is triggered if the counter is installed on a 404 page or index page and the user enters the payload as the URL.
    *   **Reflected XSS:** The application does not sanitize parameters within URLs. Specifically, the 'edit' parameter in `dspStats.php?edit=` can be used to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement of the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload used as a page address.
    *   Manipulating the `edit` parameter in the `dspStats.php` URL to inject JavaScript.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to get a user to visit the crafted URL, or get their malicious url logged by the vulnerable application.

**Full Path Disclosure Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application exposes the full server paths of include files, leading to information disclosure.
*   **Vulnerabilities:** The application outputs server path names of include files. Specific vulnerable files are:
    *   `include/edCss.inc.php`
    *   `include/foot.inc.php`
    *  `include/get_csscolors.inc.php`
    *  `include/head.inc.php`
    *  `include/head_stuff.inc.php`
    *   `include/loglist.inc.php`
    *   `include/pphlogger_send.inc.php`
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can gain information about the server's file system and the application's structure, potentially aiding further attacks. It exposes information about the file structure and potentially the OS of the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Accessing the specified include files directly through the web browser
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to make a request to the vulnerable application.
