4.  **[Gobernalia] Front End News Submitter (gb\_fenewssubmit):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries and when generating HTML output.
    *   **Impact:** XSS could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the pages, potentially leading to session hijacking and arbitrary code execution in victim's browser. SQL Injection could lead to data breaches or data manipulation.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a vulnerability in a vulnerable version via a malicious request.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the TYPO3 instance.

5.  **Mailform (mailform):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when generating HTML output.
    *    **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to session hijacking and arbitrary code execution in victim's browser.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a vulnerability in a vulnerable version via a malicious request.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the TYPO3 instance.

6.  **Myth download (myth\_download):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Blind SQL Injection vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.
      *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially extract information from database by crafting special request.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a vulnerability in a vulnerable version via a malicious request.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the TYPO3 instance.

7.  **Tour Extension (pm\_tour):**
    *   **Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.
     *   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
    *    **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a vulnerability in a vulnerable version via a malicious request.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the TYPO3 instance.

8. **Twitter Search (twittersearch):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    *  **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when generating HTML output.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the page, potentially leading to session hijacking and arbitrary code execution in victim's browser.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a vulnerability in a vulnerable version via a malicious request.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the TYPO3 instance.

9.  **Webesse E-Card (ws\_ecard):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Information Disclosure and Path Traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Weakness:**  Improper handling of file paths, potentially allowing access to sensitive information and files.
    *    **Impact:** An attacker could access sensitive files or directories outside of intended scope and reveal sensitive information.
    *    **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a vulnerability in a vulnerable version via a malicious request.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the TYPO3 instance.

10. **Webesse Image Gallery (ws\_gallery):**
    *   **Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.
