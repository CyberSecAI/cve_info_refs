Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2009-4699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of input parameters, specifically `layout` and `language_id`, in the SkaDate Dating application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application is vulnerable to LFI via the `layout` and `language_id` parameters. Attackers can use these to include local files from the server by manipulating the parameters, leading to the exposure of sensitive files.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application is also vulnerable to RFI via the `language_id` parameter. This allows attackers to include remote files, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application has multiple XSS vulnerabilities in `admin/auth.php` and `file_uploader.php`. This could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the application, impacting other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **LFI:** Exposure of sensitive files such as system configuration files, credentials etc.
*   **RFI:** Remote execution of malicious code on the server.
*  **XSS:** Execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser, which can lead to session hijacking, account compromise, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **LFI/RFI:** By manipulating the `layout` and `language_id` parameters in the URL.
*   **XSS:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `auth.php` and `file_uploader.php` pages, likely through URL parameters or other input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No special privileges or credentials are required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   An attacker does not require physical access to the server, this is a remote vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit was publicly released on 2009-07-27 and assigned EDB-ID 9260.
*   The vulnerabilities were found in the SkaDate Dating application, a PHP-based web application.
*   The exploit examples provided demonstrate both LFI and XSS attacks.
*   The content also mentions that CVE-2009-4739 and CVE-2009-4700 are also related to the same application
