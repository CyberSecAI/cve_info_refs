```
Package: gnudip
Version: 2.1.1-4.1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hi,

gnudip's web interface is vulnerable to SQL injections.  If one changes
the email address to something like

    test@example.com", level="ADMIN

one gets administrator permissions.  The server script gdips.pl also
looks prone to SQL injection attacks.

Regards,
Ansgar

Sam, what's the status? This bug is more than two months old.

Hi,

I just want to mention that there are many other SQL injection bugs in
this package.  The one I mentioned in the initial bug report is actually
just an example.

This is also not fixed in the "new" upstream release (which is also
older than six years now).

Considering that the package is no longer maintained upstream and has
several serious issues, maybe this package should be removed from
Debian?

Regards,
Ansgar

Ack, I've requested removal from the archive.

Version: 2.1.1-4.1+rm

You filled the bug <http://bugs.debian.org/539452> in Debian BTS
against the package gnudip. I'm closing it at *unstable*, but it will
remain open for older distributions.

For more information about this package's removal, read
<http://bugs.debian.org/556748>. That bug might give the reasons why
this package was removed and suggestions of possible replacements.

Don't hesitate to reply to this mail if you have any question.

Thank you for your contribution to Debian.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
