Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4680:

**1. Verification of CVE Relation:**

The content from exploit-db.com explicitly mentions `CVE-2009-4680` and details vulnerabilities found in `phpDirectorySource 1.0`, indicating a clear relation.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in insufficient input sanitization within the `search.php` script of `phpDirectorySource 1.0`, allowing for:

   *   **SQL Injection:**  Unsanitized input passed to SQL queries.
   *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Unsanitized input reflected in the output.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Vulnerability exists in `search.php`, specifically within the handling of the `st` parameter.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `st` parameter in `search.php` is also vulnerable to XSS.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database, or gain control over the database server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web page, which would then be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious actions.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   Both SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities are exploited via the `search.php` script using the vulnerable `st` parameter
    *  `http://www.site.com/patch/search.php?sa=site&sk=a&nl=11&st=`

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable server hosting the `phpDirectorySource 1.0` application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to craft malicious URLs with specific parameter values.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit-db content includes live exploit examples for both SQL injection and XSS, which are valuable for understanding the attack vectors.
*   The content notes the application is priced at $75.00, which might indicate a commercial product.
*   The content includes a Google dork for finding vulnerable instances: `Copyright 2005-2006 phpDirectorySourceâ„¢, all rights reserved`
