Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `search.php` script is vulnerable to XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via the `st` parameter, which will then be executed in the victim's browser.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `search.php` script is also vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the `st` parameter to inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to read or modify the database.

**Root Cause:**

*   The `search.php` script does not properly sanitize or validate user input before using it in SQL queries (for SQL injection) or displaying it in the HTML output (for XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    *   This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites.
*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete data in the database.
    *   This could lead to data breaches, loss of data integrity, or complete compromise of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Both vulnerabilities are exploited via HTTP requests to the `search.php` script.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `st`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No special privileges or access are required. The attacker can be a remote user accessing the application through the internet.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerable application is phpDirectorySource 1.0.
*   The exploit was published on 2009-07-21
*   The vulnerability is present in `search.php`
*   The author of the exploit is Moudi
