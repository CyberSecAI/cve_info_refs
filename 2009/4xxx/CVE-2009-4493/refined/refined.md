- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the web servers' logging mechanism failing to sanitize terminal escape sequences within HTTP requests. This allows an attacker to inject special character sequences into log files, which, when viewed in a terminal, can execute commands or perform other actions.

- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    - Improper sanitization of log output: The web servers do not properly sanitize log files to remove or escape terminal control characters.
    - Vulnerable logging functionality: The logging function is directly printing unsanitized input into the log files.

- **Impact of Exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary command execution: When the log files are displayed on a terminal (using commands such as `cat` or `tail`), the injected escape sequences can be interpreted and executed by the terminal, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution on the system where the logs are viewed.
    - Other terminal manipulation: Depending on the specific terminal emulator, other malicious actions can be performed (e.g., dumping the buffer to a file).

- **Attack Vectors:**
    - HTTP request injection: Attackers can embed malicious terminal escape sequences into various parts of the HTTP request, like the URL or headers, that the web server logs.
    - Viewing logs in a terminal: The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted logs are viewed in a terminal that interprets and executes escape sequences.

- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - Network access to the vulnerable web server: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web server.
    - Ability to view log files: The attacker does not need direct access to the log files themselves; they only need to induce the log of crafted requests and rely on the server operator or other user to view the logs in a vulnerable terminal.
