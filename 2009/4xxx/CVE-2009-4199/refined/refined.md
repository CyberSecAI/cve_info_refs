Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `com_mosres` Joomla component is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `property_uid` parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into database queries.
    *   Blind SQL Injection: The text mentions that blind SQL injection is also possible. This implies that attackers can extract information even when database errors are not directly exposed.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Data Theft: Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords.
    *   Potential for wider compromise: Exploitation could lead to further attacks or full system compromise, depending on the system setup and database permissions.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET requests: The vulnerability is exploited via crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application. Specifically, injecting malicious SQL code into the `property_uid` parameter of the `index.php` file.
    *   The vulnerable component is `com_mosres`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Joomla component. No prior authentication or special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   The attacker needs to know the structure of the database to craft effective injection attacks, and this information can often be found by trying out some simple queries.
    *   The server's `magic_quotes_gpc` setting must be set to `Off` for the provided exploit to work.

The content also provides example URLs for both Joomla and Mambo platforms, demonstrating how the attack can be performed. The SQL injection payload uses `UNION SELECT` to extract username and password data by concatenating the results. It also mentions that other parameters and locations within the component can be injected and that blind SQL injection is also possible.
