The provided content from Exploit Database describes vulnerabilities in "Flashlight Free Edition", and it includes CVE-2009-4204 in the description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `admin.php` script uses a user-supplied GET parameter `action` to include a file using `include ("admin/".$inc.".php")` without proper sanitization.
*  **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The `read.php` script directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `id` GET parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **LFI:** Improper input validation of the `action` parameter allows attackers to include arbitrary local files using path traversal.
*   **SQLi:** The lack of sanitization of the `id` parameter in the SQL query makes the application vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **LFI:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server by including them. For example, the exploit shows accessing `/etc/passwd`.
*   **SQLi:** An attacker can extract database information, potentially including usernames and passwords, or manipulate the database. The provided exploit shows extraction of username, password, database version, and user.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **LFI:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `admin.php` with a manipulated `action` parameter containing path traversal sequences (`../`) followed by the path of the file to be included.
*   **SQLi:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `read.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter containing SQL injection payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No other specific capabilities or position are required.
