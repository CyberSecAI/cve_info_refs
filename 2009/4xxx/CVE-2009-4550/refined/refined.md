Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4550:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection issue found in the `com_kunena` component of Joomla!.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not directly display the results of the SQL query, making it "blind." An attacker needs to infer information based on the application's response, usually a change in page load times or content length.
- The provided exploit code uses time-based or content-length-based analysis to extract data from the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords (hashed).
- Full Database Access: With sufficient skill and time, attackers could potentially extract other sensitive data from the database.
- Privilege Escalation: The extracted credentials could be used to gain administrative access to the Joomla! site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed via HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! component, which handles the requests incorrectly, leading to the injection vulnerability.
- The exploit targets a specific vulnerable function within the `com_kunena` component, which is not explicitly stated, but its behavior implies that it is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla! server.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable component and its parameters.
- The attacker requires a means to analyze the response based on content length/time-based analysis to extract information due to the blind nature of the SQL Injection.

**Additional Technical Details from Exploit Code:**
- The provided exploit code uses a technique to determine the length of the extracted username by sending requests with different parameters and measuring the length of responses.
- It then proceeds to iterate through possible ASCII characters to construct the username and password character by character.
- The exploit uses a SQL injection payload in the form `+and+ascii(substring((select+username+from+jos_users+limit+0,1),".$i.",1))!=0--` to extract user information.
- The code targets the `jos_users` table, a standard Joomla! user table, indicating a direct compromise to the user database is possible.
