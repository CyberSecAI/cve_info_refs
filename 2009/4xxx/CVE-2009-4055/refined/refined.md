{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the handling of RTP comfort noise payloads with a long data length.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of service (DoS) vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by sending crafted RTP comfort noise packets with excessive data length.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted RTP comfort noise payload with a long data length to the Asterisk server."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send RTP packets to the Asterisk server. No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability.",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability occurs because the `rtp.c` file in Asterisk did not handle long data lengths correctly. The fix involves not setting `rtp->f.datalen` when processing comfort noise, which prevents issues related to the data length calculation for the frame."
