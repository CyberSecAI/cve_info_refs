Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4436:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a blind SQL injection vulnerability present in eWebquiz v8. This vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input in the `QuizID` parameter within `questions.asp`, `importquestions.asp`, and `quiztakers.asp` files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, where the attacker cannot directly see the results of their SQL queries but can infer information based on the application's response (e.g., different response times for true/false conditions).
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input in the `QuizID` parameter, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the application's database, such as usernames, passwords, or quiz-related data.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:**  Depending on the database configuration and privileges, the attacker might be able to escalate their access and manipulate data, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the application and underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable ASP pages (`questions.asp`, `importquestions.asp`, and `quiztakers.asp`).
- The attacker would need to manipulate the `QuizID` parameter in the URL with SQL injection payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable eWebquiz application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques, particularly blind SQL injection.
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests with manipulated parameters.

**Additional details:**
- The exploit-db entry provides specific examples of how to test for the vulnerability by using `1 and 1=1` and `1 and 1=2` in the `QuizID` parameter. True results are identified with `7Ru3` and False results are identified with `f4L53`. This confirms the presence of blind SQL injection and allows an attacker to perform conditional attacks and extract data from the database.
