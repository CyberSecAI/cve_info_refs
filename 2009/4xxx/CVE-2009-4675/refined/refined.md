Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control in the `admin_info/index.php` file within the Mole Group Restaurant Directory Script 3.0. This allows an attacker to directly access the page that handles changing the administrator password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `admin_info/index.php` page is directly accessible without proper authentication checks.
- **Lack of Authorization:** The script fails to verify if the user accessing the page is an authorized administrator before allowing password changes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Admin Account Takeover:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to change the administrator's password. This grants complete control over the application, enabling them to manipulate data, potentially compromise the server, and deny service to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request:** The attacker directly navigates their web browser to the vulnerable URL: `http://[target_server]/admin/admin_info/index.php`
- **Form Submission:** The attacker fills out the form on the page and submits it, which triggers the password change logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to possess administrator credentials prior to the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information is more detailed than the standard CVE description. It clearly outlines the vulnerable URL, the mechanism of exploitation (form submission), and the direct impact (admin password change).
- This vulnerability allows for a complete administrative takeover, making it a critical security issue.
