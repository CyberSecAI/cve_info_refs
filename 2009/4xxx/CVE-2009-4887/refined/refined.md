Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the CMS S.Builder handles file inclusion. Specifically, the `binn_include_path` variable, which is used in `include_once` statements, can be manipulated by an attacker when `register_globals` is enabled in PHP.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can inject a remote URL into the `binn_include_path` variable. This allows the attacker to include a malicious file from a remote server, if `allow_url_fopen` is also enabled.
-   **Unsafe Use of `register_globals`:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the use of the `register_globals` PHP setting, which is considered insecure because it allows external variables (from GET/POST/Cookies) to directly overwrite global variables.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The CMS fails to properly sanitize the binn_include_path variable before using it in include_once function

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to full compromise of the server, data theft, website defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker can inject the malicious URL through the `binn_include_path` cookie in an HTTP GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
-   **Vulnerable Server Configuration:** The server must have `register_globals` set to "On" and, for remote file inclusion, `allow_url_fopen` needs to be enabled.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content indicates that the vulnerable software is "CMS S.Builder <= 3.7"
- It provides a proof-of-concept HTTP request demonstrating the attack.
- It notes that milw0rm.com also published this vulnerability on 2009-03-09
