Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4672

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the `main.php` file of the WordPress Lytebox plugin. This is due to insufficient sanitization of the `pg` parameter, which allows an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include local files from the server. This is exploited by manipulating the `pg` parameter in the `main.php` script.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Indirect):** While not a direct RCE, the LFI vulnerability can be leveraged to achieve RCE by including and executing code within server log files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files, password files (`/etc/profile`, example) and potentially database credentials, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting PHP code into web server log files (e.g., `access_log`) and then including that log file via the LFI vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `main.php` file.
- **`pg` Parameter Manipulation:** The `pg` parameter in the URL is used to specify the path of the file to be included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker must be aware of the Lytebox plugin's presence and the vulnerability in `main.php`.
- **Ability to Inject Code into Server Logs:** To achieve RCE, the attacker must be able to inject PHP code into the web server log files (e.g. `access_log`). This is typically done by sending a request to the webserver with php code in a parameter value.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `main.php` file within the `wp-lytebox` plugin directory.
- The attacker uses path traversal (e.g., `../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/profile`) within the `pg` parameter to navigate outside the intended plugin directory and access arbitrary files.
- Remote code execution is achieved by injecting PHP code into server logs, and then including the logs via LFI to execute that code:

```
RCE;

open cmd (cmd aÃ§Ä±yoruz)

nc -vv 127.0.0.1 80 (connecting)
GET /<?php passthru(\$_GET[cmd]); ?> HTTP/1.0
Host : www.target.com

Our error is recorded and access_log :) yeah

http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/wp-lytebox/main.php?pg=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../var/log/apache2/access_log&cmd=[RCE]
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit demonstrates how an attacker can inject PHP code and trigger its execution by including the access log file, enabling them to run arbitrary commands on the server.
- The exploit suggests several locations where web server logs might be located, indicating the attacker may need to attempt several paths to identify the correct log file on the target system.
