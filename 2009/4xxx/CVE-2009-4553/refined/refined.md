```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in iRehearse when processing a specially crafted .m3u file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the "MILW0RM" header followed by a large sequence of "A" characters in a .m3u file.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by causing the application to crash.
- Attack vectors: A malicious .m3u file is created with the crafted payload, and if this file is opened by the vulnerable iRehearse application, the vulnerability will be triggered.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious .m3u file to the user and have the user open it with the vulnerable application. This is a local attack.
