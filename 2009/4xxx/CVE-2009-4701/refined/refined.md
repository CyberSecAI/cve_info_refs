The provided content is a security advisory for TYPO3, specifically **TYPO3-SA-2009-010**, which details multiple vulnerabilities found in several third-party extensions. This directly relates to CVE-2009-4701.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant vulnerability information:

**Vulnerabilities:**

The advisory lists the following vulnerabilities in different extensions:

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **CoolURI (cooluri):** Versions 1.0.15 and below.
    *   **Reset backend password (cwt\_resetbepassword):** Versions 1.2.0 and below.
    *   **datamints Newsticker (datamints\_newsticker):** Versions 0.7.1 and below.
    *   **\[Gobernalia] Front End News Submitter (gb\_fenewssubmit):** Versions 0.1.0 and below.
    *   **Tour Extension (pm\_tour):** Versions 0.0.12 and below.
    *   **Webesse Image Gallery (ws\_gallery):** Versions 1.0.4 and below.
    *   **Myth download (myth_download):** Version 0.1.0 (Blind SQL Injection)
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **\[Gobernalia] Front End News Submitter (gb\_fenewssubmit):** Versions 0.1.0 and below.
    *   **Mailform (mailform):** Versions 0.9.23 and below.
    *   **Twitter Search (twittersearch):** Versions 0.1.0 and below.
*   **Information Disclosure and Path Traversal:**
    *   **Webesse E-Card (ws\_ecard):** Versions 1.0.2 and below.

**Root Cause:**

The root causes of these vulnerabilities are related to insecure coding practices within the third-party extensions:

*   **SQL Injection:** Failure to properly sanitize user inputs before using them in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Failure to sanitize user inputs before displaying them on the page, enabling attackers to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Information Disclosure and Path Traversal:** Improper handling of file paths, potentially allowing attackers to access sensitive information or files outside the intended directories.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies:

*   **SQL Injection:** Could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. In severe cases, it could lead to complete control over the database.
*  **Blind SQL Injection:** Similar to SQL injection but without direct feedback, making it more challenging but still possible to extract data or gain control.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Could allow attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*  **Information Disclosure:** Could reveal sensitive information to unauthorized users.
* **Path Traversal:**  Could allow access to arbitrary files on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL code through vulnerable input fields or parameters in the application.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts through vulnerable input fields or parameters, which are then displayed to other users.
* **Information Disclosure and Path Traversal:** Attackers can exploit this by manipulating file paths to access sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For most of these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable TYPO3 application.
*   For SQL injections, no specific user level is needed, making them exploitable by any user who can reach the vulnerable point.
*  XSS attacks usually require that an attacker is able to cause a script to execute in another user's browser, which can be accomplished in many ways depending on the context.
*  Path traversal typically involves manipulating file paths in requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that the affected extensions are third-party and not part of the TYPO3 default installation.
*   For some extensions, a fixed version is available, while for others, the recommendation is to uninstall the extension due to the lack of a security update.
*   The advisory credits the researchers who discovered and reported the issues.
*   The advisory includes a general recommendation to follow the TYPO3 SECURITY Guide.
