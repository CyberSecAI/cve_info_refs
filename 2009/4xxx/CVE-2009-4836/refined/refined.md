Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `init.php` file of the Movie PHP Script v2.0. The script directly evaluates unsanitized user input from the `anticode` parameter using the `eval()` function, specifically: `@eval(stripslashes($_REQUEST['anticode']));`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** The primary weakness is the direct use of `eval()` on user-supplied input without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `stripslashes()` function is insufficient to prevent malicious code injection, as it only removes backslashes, which are not the primary concern for PHP code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Compromise:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the web server, leading to a complete compromise of the application and potentially the server itself.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data, such as database credentials or user information.
- **Website Defacement:** An attacker could modify website content, inject malware, or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Service Disruption:** An attacker could disrupt the availability of the website by causing crashes or overloading the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `init.php` file.
- **`anticode` Parameter:** The attack payload is injected into the `anticode` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is directly exploitable without prior authentication.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have basic knowledge of how to form HTTP requests to include a payload in a GET parameter.

**Summary:**

The provided exploit information shows that CVE-2009-4836 is a Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Movie PHP Script v2.0. It is due to the use of `eval()` with unsanitized user input, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code by sending a crafted HTTP GET request. This poses a critical risk and can lead to complete compromise of the server.
