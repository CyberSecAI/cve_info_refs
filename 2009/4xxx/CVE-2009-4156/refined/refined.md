Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of the `pms` module within Ciamos CMS. Specifically, the `module_path` parameter, which is passed via HTTP GET, is used in an `include_once` statement without proper sanitization. This allows for the inclusion of remote files.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is that the application is susceptible to RFI.  It directly uses user-supplied input (`module_path`) in an `include_once` statement, allowing an attacker to include files from external sources.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable Ciamos CMS instance. This can lead to complete compromise of the server.
    *   **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the server by exploiting this vulnerability

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `index.php` file.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the server hosting the vulnerable Ciamos CMS application.
    *   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs a location to host the malicious file that they intend to include on the target server.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

The Ciamos CMS 0.9.5 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure use of the `module_path` parameter in `modules/pms/index.php`. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by including a malicious remote file. The attacker needs to send a malicious HTTP GET request with a crafted `module_path` parameter pointing to their controlled remote server hosting a malicious file.
