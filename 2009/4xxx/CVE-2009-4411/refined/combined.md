# CVE-2009-4411

| **Name** | CVE-2009-4411 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The (1) setfacl and (2) getfacl commands in XFS acl 2.2.47, when running in recursive (-R) mode, follow symbolic links even when the --physical (aka -P) or -L option is specified, which might allow local users to modify the ACL for arbitrary files or directories via a symlink attack. |

| [Fri 22 Jan 2010 11:54:37 PM UTC, comment #3:](#comment3) Quote  Good catch. Thanks for the patch. Added to git:   <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/acl.git/commit/?id=d539830d19b35df0c12c0b7d36c1f6c428f34a91> | [Brandon Philips <philips>](/users/philips) Group administrator |
| [Sat 26 Dec 2009 12:40:32 PM UTC, comment #2:](#comment2) Quote  Well,   fixing the bug in the same way as   <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/acl.git/commit/?id=63451a0>   but this time for setfacl seems to be correct.    But it remains the question why walk\_tree\_rec decides not to follow symlinks (by setting "follow\_symlinks" to 0, and then follows them...  (*[file #19363](//file.savannah.nongnu.org/file/setfacl.patch?file_id=19363)*) | [Markus Steinborn <msteinbo>](/users/msteinbo) |
| [Sat 26 Dec 2009 09:54:11 AM UTC, comment #1:](#comment1) Quote  I took a deeper look at the source code. Assume setfacl  is called as above.   After processing the options, the function walk\_tree\_rec (file:  libmisc/walk\_tree.c) is called with path ".". A little time later, the same function is called with path "2", which is a symlink.   In line 62 of libmisc/walk\_tree.c, it is decided not to follow symlinks (that is correct!). In line 77, lstat(...) is called on the symlink "2".   The conditions in line 79 and line 81 are true, so on line 84 stat(...) is called on the symlink "2". Note that "2" is a dangling symlink in my example (otherwise "ls" would have listed a file named "1"), so stat() failes, because stat follows symlinks in contrast to lstat(). This failure is returned to the  caller on line 85.      Please comment the attached patch.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- virtualbox-ose
This update of virtualbox-ose fixes a memory consumption bug in the
kernel code that can be used to allocate almost all physical memory
(CVE-2009-3940).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- NetworkManager-gnome
nm-applet connected to WPA2 Enterprise networks even if the specified CA
certificate file didn't exist (CVE-2009-4144).
When editing connections in nm-applet the connection object was exported via
DBus disclosing potentially sensitive information to local users
(CVE-2009-4145).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- avahi
The avahi-daemon reflector could cause packet storms when reflecting
legacy unicast mDNS traffic (CVE-2009-0758).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- acl
the getfacl tool followed symbolic links in recursive (-R) mode even
if the --physical (-P) option was specified (CVE-2009-4411).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- libthai
very long strings could lead to a heap buffer overflow in libthai
(CVE-2009-4012).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
Package: acl
Version: 2.2.47-2

After upgrading a system from Etch to Lenny, we are having some problems
with our backup scripts which rely on getfacl/getfattr.

Previously we had been using "getfacl -RP ..." to recursively dump all
the ACLs in a number of directories which are also Samba shares. Because
we use the DFS features of Samba, we have numerous intentional
"dangling" symlinks in these directories. However, now this is causing
getfacl to exit with non-zero status and spew lots of unwanted output to
stderr.

A simple test case to reproduce the problem:

  #!/bin/sh
  ln -f -s no_such_file foo
  getfacl -RP . > dev/null
  echo $?

Output on Etch:
  0

Output on Lenny:
  getfacl: ./foo: No such file or directory
  1

I realise that upstream changed the behaviour at some point there, as
the manpage description of the -P option differs between Etch/Lenny.
However, we still need a way to ignore all symlinks - if the current
behaviour is be design (I don't understand why this would be desirable),
then can we have another option to completely ignore symlinks?

Thanks,
Kevin.

Hi,

it seems this problem was introduced in 2.2.46, during the tree_walk rewrite
in the acl tools. Upstream has a report for this as well [1].

According to CVS logs [2], this bugs was fixed in upstream CVS two months ago.
However, I do not think another release has happened since then. I'm not sure
about upstream's release plans in this area, but if no release happens soon,
perhaps Debian should include the patch [3] separately?

Since the bug also applies to setfacl, not just getfacl, I would also consider
this bug to be more severe than "normal", probably even a release-critical
regression (due to the security implications of unexpected acl changes).

Gr.

Matthijs

Hi,

a lot users and admins use these tiny scripts to backup their ACLs.

e.g.:
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p /root/files
getfacl -R / | gzip -c -9 > /root/files/aclbackup.gz

But with acl from lenny these scripts will not work anymore. The
behaviour of getfacl changed. So I get a maybe endless recursion in
/sys. Even 'getfacl -R -P' doesn't solve this.

You can change the last line to
'getfacl -R /sys | gzip -c -9 > /root/files/aclbackup.gz'
to gain a lot of data within minutes (here 3,5 megabytes in a few
minutes). On one machine I get output to stderr which notes that there
are "Too many levels of symbolic links". An example is attached.

A possible suggestion: Don't backup the ACLs of /sys. But what if I run
into these problems with more important data?

Regards,
Marcus

Upstream has fixed the issue:
 <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/acl.git/commit/?id=63451a0>

New releases here that include the fix here:
 <https://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=acl>

Also, upstream for acl and attr has moved from SGI ->
savannah.gnu.org.

Releases are found here:
 <https://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=attr>
 <https://savannah.nongnu.org/files/?group=acl>

Mailing list here:

Just for your information:

version 2.2.49 improves the situation, that's right. But it does not fix
the bug.

For a test case that does not work and a working patch that I
contributed see

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

lenny (5.0.9)

Please arrange to backport your fix and liase with the release team for
permission to upload. I will happily assist you if the patch is
straightforward and you need help or lack time.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [1] and my blog post [2].

Thanks,

with his security hat on:

From: Hanno Böck <hanno@...eck.de>

Subject: CVE request: acl 2.2.47 always follows symlinks

setfacl/getfacl (part of package acl-2.2.47) contains a bug that it ignores
the --physical/-P parameter that means don't follow symlinks on -R
(recursive).

This can lead to security problems, e.g. if there's a cron script giving a
user full rwX rights for a directory, he can put a symlink there pointing to /
or /etc or whatever.
Another scenario would be a backup script saving the /home acls to a file,
every user can create an endless loop for that and prevent the script from
completing.

<http://oss.sgi.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=790>
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=265425>
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=499076>

Fixed in upstream source, but no new release yet.
Please assign a CVE.
