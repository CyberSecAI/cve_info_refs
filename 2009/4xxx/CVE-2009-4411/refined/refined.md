Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-4411:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an error in the `walk_tree_rec` function within the `acl` package, specifically in how it handles symbolic links when processing file system objects recursively. The `setfacl` and `getfacl` utilities, when used with the `-R` (recursive) option, were incorrectly following symlinks even when the `-P` (physical) option was specified. This option is meant to prevent the tools from traversing symlinks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Symlink Handling:** The core weakness is the failure of `setfacl` and `getfacl` to respect the `-P` option when used in recursive mode with `-R`. Instead of operating on the symlink itself, the utilities would follow the symlink and operate on the target of the link.
*   **Bypass of Intended Behavior:** The tools were not behaving as expected with regard to the `-P` flag, leading to unexpected modification or reporting of file ACLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary ACL Modification:** A local user could create a symlink to a sensitive file or directory. By then using `setfacl -R -P` or  `setfacl -R -L` and targeting the symlink, the user could change the ACL of the symlink target, even if it was a file they wouldn't normally have write permissions for and circumvent security.
*  **Denial of Service:** A local user could create a directory structure that contains a loop through symlinks, causing `getfacl -R` to enter an infinite loop or produce an extremely large output, potentially preventing backup scripts from completing. This is due to the programs following symlinks even when they shouldn't.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create symlinks.
*   **Command Execution:** The attacker must be able to execute `setfacl` or `getfacl` commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   A local user with the ability to create files and directories, including symbolic links.
*   Ability to execute `setfacl` or `getfacl` command-line tools with recursive option.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   The bug was introduced in `acl` version 2.2.46 during a rewrite of the `tree_walk` functionality.
*   The issue affects both `setfacl` and `getfacl` commands.
*   Upstream fixes were made by commit `63451a06b7484d220750ed8574d3ee84e156daf5` to the `acl` project.
*   A patch provided by Markus Steinborn (`acl-physical-walk.patch`) was incorporated to fully resolve the issue.

**Summary:**

CVE-2009-4411 describes a vulnerability where `setfacl` and `getfacl` incorrectly followed symlinks in recursive mode, even when the `-P` flag was used. This could be exploited by a local user to modify ACLs of arbitrary files or to cause a denial of service by creating symlink loops. The vulnerability is present in `acl` version 2.2.47 and earlier, and was fixed in later versions with the correct handling of symlinks during recursive operations when using the physical flag.
