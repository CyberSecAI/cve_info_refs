Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `show.php` and `xml.php` scripts of the Alwasel 1.5 application. Specifically, the `id` parameter passed through the GET request is directly incorporated into SQL queries without any form of escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly embeds the unsanitized `id` parameter from the GET request into SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code. This occurs in multiple locations:
    - `show.php` when accessing the `cat` table.
    - `show.php` when accessing the `site` table.
    - `xml.php` when accessing the `cat` table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive information stored within the application's database.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (potential):** In some cases, depending on database privileges, SQL injection might be leveraged to execute system commands or install malware.
- **Denial of Service:** By crafting specific SQL injection queries, an attacker might be able to crash the database server, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vectors are the `show.php` and `xml.php` scripts. The vulnerability is exploited via malicious crafted URLs using the `id` parameter within a GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No authentication or special privileges within the application are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker only needs a web browser or command line tool like curl to make the HTTP GET requests.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit examples provided demonstrate how an attacker can use `UNION SELECT` statements to extract database information, such as the database version.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple locations within the application code.
