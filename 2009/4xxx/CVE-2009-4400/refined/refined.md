The provided content is a security advisory for multiple TYPO3 third-party extensions, and it is relevant to CVE-2009-4400.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause varies depending on the extension: SQL injection vulnerabilities arise from unsanitized user input being directly included in SQL queries. Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities stem from the improper handling of user-supplied data in the application's output, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Information disclosure vulnerabilities arise when the application reveals sensitive information that should be protected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The advisory details the following weaknesses:
*   **SQL Injection:**  The extensions `car`, `xds_staff`, `danp_documentdirs`, `ste_prayer2`, `pd_resources`, `hs_religiousartgallery`, `ste_parish_admin`, `pd_calendar`, `slideshow`, `mf_subscription`, `no_indexed_search`, `jobexchange` are vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The extensions `dr_blob`, `nl_listman`, `ste_prayer2`, `pd_resources`, `hs_religiousartgallery`, `ste_parish_admin`, `pd_calendar`, `no_indexed_search`, `trainincdb`, `zid_linklist`, `vshoutbox`, and `fe_rtenews` are vulnerable to XSS.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `aba_watchdog` extension is vulnerable to information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially manipulate database queries to read, modify, or delete data, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application or its underlying data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that could steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or deface the website.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Malicious user input injected via form fields or URL parameters.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious script injected through user-supplied data, which is then displayed to other users.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Unspecified, but likely involves accessing a page or function that exposes information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   An attacker would need to identify and exploit vulnerable input fields to inject malicious code or SQL commands. They would need to have some interaction with the web application. The attacker does not need to be a privileged user in many cases (e.g. SQL Injection and XSS in public forms).
