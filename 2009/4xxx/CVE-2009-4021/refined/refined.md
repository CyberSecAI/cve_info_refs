{
  "CVE-2009-4021": {
    "Description": "The fuse_direct_io function in fs/fuse/file.c in the fuse subsystem in the Linux kernel might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and OOPS) via vectors possibly related to a memory-consumption attack.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The fuse_direct_io() function has a loop where requests are allocated in each iteration. If allocation fails, the loop is broken, and an invalid pointer is passed to fuse_put_request(), leading to a dereference.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Unconditional call to fuse_put_request() with an invalid pointer.",
       "Memory allocation failure handling in a loop",
      "Use of invalid pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and kernel OOPS), possible privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker triggers the vulnerability by inducing a low-memory condition and utilizing the FUSE subsystem.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user, ability to trigger memory allocation failure and make use of the FUSE file system."
