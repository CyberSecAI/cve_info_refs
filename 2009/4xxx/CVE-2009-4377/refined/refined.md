```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A NULL pointer dereference was found in the SMB/SMB2 dissectors.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: NULL pointer dereference.
- Impact of exploitation: Crash of the Wireshark application, potentially leading to denial of service.
- Attack vectors: By analyzing a malformed packet trace file, or by capturing and analyzing network traffic containing specially crafted SMB/SMB2 packets.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to either convince a user to open a malicious packet capture file or be in a position to capture network traffic that the user will analyze using Wireshark.
