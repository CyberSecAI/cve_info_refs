How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## wnpa-sec-2009-09 · Multiple vulnerabilities in Wireshark

## Summary

**Name:** Multiple vulnerabilities in Wireshark

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2009-09

**Date:** December 17, 2009

**Affected versions:** 0.9.0 up to and including
1.2.4

**Fixed versions:** 1.2.5

## Details

### Description

Wireshark 1.2.5 fixes the following vulnerabilities:

* The Daintree SNA file parser could overflow a buffer.

  ([Bug
  4294](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4294))

  Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.4
  [CVE-2009-4376](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4376)* The SMB and SMB2 dissectors could crash.

    ([Bug
    4301](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4301))

    Versions affected: 0.9.0 to 1.2.4
    [CVE-2009-4377](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4377)* The IPMI dissector could crash on Windows.

      ([Bug
      4319](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4319))

      Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.4
      [CVE-2009-4378](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4378)

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crash remotely or by convincing
someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.2.5 or later. Due to the nature of the
Daintree SNA vulnerability, there is no workaround.

Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-4337 CVE-2010-0304

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark
network traffic analyzer, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-4337

    A NULL pointer dereference was found in the SMB/SMB2 dissectors.

CVE-2010-0304

    Several buffer overflows were found in the LWRES dissector.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-3+lenny8.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your Wireshark packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
