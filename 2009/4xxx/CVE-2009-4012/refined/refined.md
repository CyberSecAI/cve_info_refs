Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-4012:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow leading to a heap buffer overflow in `libthai`. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in the Thai word breaking functionality within `libthai`. The code failed to validate the size of input strings before allocating memory, leading to a heap buffer overflow when processing very long strings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The code didn't properly handle very large values when calculating memory allocation size.
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** Due to the integer overflow, a smaller-than-required buffer was allocated on the heap and data was written beyond the allocated space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application. This is achieved by carefully crafting a malicious input string that overflows the heap buffer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted long strings to an application using libthai, such as an application that processes text input. This was highlighted in the Ubuntu security notice.
- **Local:** Although remote attack vector was the most emphasized, the Debian security advisory also mentions a "local" problem type, suggesting local user could potentially exploit the vulnerability by providing a specially-crafted long string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send or provide long strings:** The attacker needs to be able to send or provide long strings to an application that is using the vulnerable `libthai` library.
- **Understanding of the vulnerable code:** While not always strictly required, a more sophisticated attacker with knowledge of the vulnerable code could craft more effective exploit strings.
