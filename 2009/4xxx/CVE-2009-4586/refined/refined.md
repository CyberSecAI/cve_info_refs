The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Wowd search client, as found by Lostmon.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the Wowd search client's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before embedding it into a web page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core issue is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that the malicious script is injected into the URL and reflected back by the web server to the victim's browser.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser. This can lead to a wide range of malicious actions, including session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirection to phishing sites, or the injection of malware.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through manipulating the variables used by the Wowd search client. By crafting a URL containing malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when a user clicks the crafted link or visits the page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript and lure a victim into accessing it through phishing or other social engineering tactics. The attacker does not need direct access to the web server.

The provided content gives more detail than the official CVE description by specifying that this is a reflected XSS and that the vulnerability is related to the manipulation of client variables.
