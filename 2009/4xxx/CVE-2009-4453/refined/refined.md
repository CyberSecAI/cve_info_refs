```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The SoftCab Sound Converter ActiveX control (sndConverter.ocx) has an insecure method `SaveFormat` that allows arbitrary file creation.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure method, Arbitrary file creation
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can create arbitrary files on the user's system when the user loads a malicious webpage using the vulnerable ActiveX control. This can lead to arbitrary code execution by writing an executable to a known location and executing it.
- Attack vectors: By enticing a user to visit a specially crafted webpage.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to host a web page containing the malicious code and induce a user with the vulnerable ActiveX control installed to visit the page.
