The provided content discusses a vulnerability in the XOOPS Profile module related to user activation and provides a patch.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the fact that any user, even those not yet activated and awaiting administrative approval, can request and receive their activation code via email using the "resend activation code" functionality. This bypasses the administrative approval process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control during user activation.
- Failure to enforce administrative approval requirements when resending activation emails.
- Lack of notification to administrators when a user bypasses the approval process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users can activate their accounts, circumventing the administrative approval process.
- This can lead to unapproved access to the system.
- Administrators are not notified of the bypass, making it harder to detect and address the problem.

**Attack vectors:**
- An unactivated user can exploit this by using the resend activation functionality (available in `activate.php`). The content indicates that although no links exist in templates, the functionality was still accessible if the user knew the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a registered user with an account that is not yet activated and waiting for administrator approval
- The attacker needs to be aware of the existence of the `activate.php` file and its resend functionality.

**Patch:**
The proposed fix involves modifying line 80 of `activate.php` from:
`elseif (!empty($_REQUEST['email'])) {`
to:
`elseif (!empty($_REQUEST['email']) && $xoopsConfigUser['activation_type'] != 0) {`

This change prevents the email from being sent if the site is configured to require admin activation.
Additionally, the content suggests preventing the form from displaying in the first place when admin activation is required.

The fix has been committed by a core developer.
