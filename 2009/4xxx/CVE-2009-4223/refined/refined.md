```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability due to the insecure inclusion of the '$DOCUMENT_ROOT' variable in the 'krgourl.php' file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The 'krgourl.php' script directly includes the path specified in the 'DOCUMENT_ROOT' variable without proper sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file from a server under their control, leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'DOCUMENT_ROOT' parameter in the HTTP GET request to 'krgourl.php'.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the web server hosting the vulnerable 'kr-web' application, and control over a remote server hosting a malicious file to be included."
