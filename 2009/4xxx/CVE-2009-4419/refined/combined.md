### Another TXT Attack

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjG-uTPmC_6gCpPHtvKSpQpilYjzuL1ajp4T39nZyEKZxDiPPsYyFqrNe4v7dJDyadBOVqv4mnuQ0Qeyo-GcSclox98cMBdMyaEKxiIt_n4E9MXId64-A9QQrG0UPLOWR2Ns4Km/s200/broken+chain.jpg)Earlier this year our team has [presented](http://invisiblethingslab.com/press/itl-press-2009-02.pdf) an attack against Intel TXT that exploited a design problem with SMM mode being over privileged on PC platforms and able to interfere with the SENTER instruction. The Intel response was two-fold: to [patch](http://security-center.intel.com/advisory.aspx?intelid=INTEL-SA-00018&languageid=en-fr) the SMM implementation bugs we used for the attack (this patch was for both the NVACPI SMM attacks, as well as for the [SMM caching attack](http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2009/03/attacking-smm-memory-via-intel-cpu.html)), and also to start (intensify?) working on STM specification, that is, we heard, planned to be published sometime in the near future. STM is a thin hypervisor concept that is supposed to provide protection against (potentially) malicious SMMs.

Today we present a totally different attack that allows an attacker to trick the SENTER instruction into misconfiguring the VT-d engine, so that it doesn’t protect the newly loaded hypervisor or kernel. This attack exploits an implementation flaw in a SINIT AC module. This new attack also allows for full TXT circumvention, using a software-only attack. This attack doesn't require any SMM bugs to succeed and is totally independent from the previous one.

The press release is [here](http://invisiblethingslab.com/press/itl-press-2009-04.pdf).

The full paper is [here](http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/misc09/Another%20TXT%20Attack.pdf).

The advisory published by Intel today can be found [here](http://security-center.intel.com/advisory.aspx?intelid=INTEL-SA-00021&languageid=en-fr).

Enjoy.

As always, excellent work on your teams efforts to help us all get to the bottom of (in)security. Just be sure to let us know if we ever make you mad Joanna ;)

Abstract

Earlier  this year  our  team has presented an attack against Intel® TXT that  exploited a design
problem with SMM mode being over  privileged on PC platforms and able to interfere with the
SENTER instruction. This time we  present a different attack  that allows an attacker  to trick
the SENTER instruction  into  misconfiguring  the  VT-d engine,  so  that it doesnʼt protect the
newly loaded MLE. This attack exploits implementation flaws in a so called SINIT module.

keywords: Intel TXT, Intel VT-d, SINIT, SENTER, Trusted Boot, Attack, Circumvention

Introduction

For  the  basic  introduction  about  Intel®  TXT,  the
reader  is  referenced  to our  previous paper  on  this
topic  [1], or alternatively, for a  much more complete
and  in-depth  introduction,  to  the updated  book  by
David Grawrock [2].

The attack  presented below  assumes  the attacker
can  execute  his  or  her  code  before  the  TXTʼs
SENTER  instruction  is  executed,  e.g.  by  infecting
the boot loader. The attacker code, as we will show
below, can  then  misconfigure the chipset in such  a
way that the SENTER instruction  would be unable
to  properly  setup   VT-d  protections  for  the  newly
loaded  MLE  (e.g.  hypervisor). As  a  result,  the  at-
tacker  would  be  able  to  compromise  the  securely
loaded hypervisor using a classic DMA attack.

The Intel®  TXT  technology  has  been  designed  ex-
actly to prevent  scenarios  like  the  above.  In  other
words, Intel®  TXT  secure  launch  process assumes
that the system  might  be compromised before  the
SENTER   instruction
is  executed,  and  yet  the
SENTER  instruction  is  expected  to  securely  load
and  start  the  hypervisor.  The  attack  described  in
this  paper  demonstrates  this  assumption  doesnʼt
hold in practice, because of  certain implementation
errors.

Intel VT-d background information

For  the attack  described  in  this  paper, it  is  impor-
tant to understand certain internals of how Intel VT-
d technology  is implemented.  The  reader  can  find

much  more details about VT-d internals in  the Intel
official specification [3].

As illustrated on  Figure 1, Intel  VT-d logic  is imple-
mented in  the Memory  Controller  Hub  (MCH, also
called the Northbridge).  System  software,  such  as
the OS or  the hypervisor, can  configure each  VT-d
remapping unit so that all devices connected under

It  is  important  to  stress  that  a  typical  system  has
more than  just one DMA remapping unit. In the ex-
ample in  the figure above there are four  independ-
ent  remapping  units  in  the  system.  Separate  re-
mapping  units  could  be  used,  for  instance,  for
graphics  and  audio  cards,  another  for  Intel  Man-
agement  Engine (which  is  used for AMT), and yet
another one for  all  the other  PCI  and PCI Express
devices,  like  network  cards, SATA controllers,  and
all  the  legacy  PCI  devices  connected  via  the
Southbridge.

An  important  question  we  should  answer,  is  how
the  system  software  knows  how  many  DMA  re-
mapping  units  are  present  in  the  system,  which
devices  are  connected  to  each  unit,  and  where
their configuration registers are located?

The answer  to the above questions  is  provided by
the so called DMAR ACPI table.

3.

The DMAR ACPI table

The Intel VT-d specification [3] defines the so called
DMAR ACPI  table,  whose  sole  purpose is  to  pro-
vide  detailed  description  about  each  DMA  remap-
ping  unit  in  the  system.  Those  tables  are  being
constructed  in  RAM,  and  exposed  to  the  system
software by the BIOS. Here, the assumption is that
the OEM,  which  provides the BIOS, knows exactly
the hardware used by the platform (in  that case the
specifics of the Memory Controller Hub), as well as
where its configuration  registers has  been  mapped
into system memory.

On  Figure  2,  a  structure  used  to describe proper-
ties of one DMA Remapping Unit is presented. Two
fields are of special importance for  us: the Register
Base Address  field,  that  tells  the  system  software
where the memory-mapped  configuration  registers
are located in the system physical memory address
space,  and  also the Device Scope[], which  identi-
fies  devices  connected  to  this  DMA  Remapping
Unit. The devices are identified by  specifying their
BDF addresses, or ranges of BDF addresses.

Problem with the DMAR ACPI table
4.
An alert reader should have already spotted a prob-
lem  related to the use of  DMAR ACPI table for  re-
porting of VT-d hardware configuration: ACPI tables
are not  digitally  signed  by  the BIOS,  nor  they  are
protected  in  any  way.  In  fact  it  is  easy  for  the  at-
tacker  to modify  DMAR table by simply overwriting
system memory.2

8*6$*’F+;<$*G’5HDIJKA>>L

Indeed, our  first idea  for  the attack  was to subvert
the  DMAR   ACPI  table  in  such  a  way  that  the
SENTER instruction (as well as the rest of the sys-
tem  software  executed  afterwards,  e.g.  tboot  and
Xen)  got a  wrong  picture  of  VT-d  hardware.  More
precisely, we wanted to cheat that there is only one
DMA remapping  unit  in  the system,  and  we would
choose  a  unit  which  is  “innocent”  from  our  at-
tackerʼs perspective.

E.g. we observed that  vPro systems  have a  sepa-
rate  DMA  remapping  unit  dedicated  for  the  Man-
agement  Engine (ME)  only.  Because our  DMA at-
tack  would not come from  the ME, but  rather from
some ordinary  device like the network  card or  disk
controller, it  would be useful  to pretend to  the sys-
tem  that this ME-specific  remapping unit is the only
one remapping unit in  the system and that it covers
all  the  devices.  In  that  case,  we  anticipated,  the
SENTER instruction  and later the MLE  (e.g. tboot,
or Xen)  would only initialize and setup  this one re-
mapping  unit,  thinking  this  would  protect  against
DMA attacks  from  all  the  devices  in  the  system.

2 It is indeed very easy, because we assume a scenario where the attacker executes code before SENTER, which in practice means the attacker subverted e.g.
the bootloader. In that situation there is no OS that could apply any protections on the memory where BIOS stored the ACPI tables, including the DMAR table.

2

After all, they should have no way of knowing there
are other remapping units for other devices.

Interestingly,  after  implementing  a  simple  DMAR
subverting  exploit,  it  turned out  that  the  SENTER
instruction  didnʼt  execute  successfully.  In  fact,  it
returned an  error  about  the VT-d  configuration  re-
ported in the DMAR table 3...

5.

The mysterious SINIT module

A curious  reader  would already  be asking a  ques-
tion: so how  the SENTER  instruction  knew  that the
VT-d  configuration  reported  in  DMAR  was  a  fake
one?

It turned  out  that this  is  one  of the roles  of the so
called SINIT  Authenticated Code modules, that are
distributed  by  Intel  for  all  TXT-capable  chipsets.
Currently the modules are being made available as
part of the Intelʼs reference implementation of TXT-
based trusted boot project   [5], but in the future the
specific  modules  might  be  bundled  together  with
the BIOS firmware.

The internals (exact algorithms and code)  of SINIT
modules  are  not  documented  by  Intel.  All  that  is
officially  known  is  that  the  SENTER  instruction
loads4   and  executes  the SINIT  module  specific  to
the chipset on which  itʼs running, and that the code
the SINIT  module contains is tasked with enforcing
appropriate  platform  configuration  needed  for  se-
cure launch process.

It is important to notice that the SINIT  modules are
digitally  signed and that  the  code inside SINIT  will
get  executed  by  SENTER only  if the  signature  is
intact.

We took  a  closer  look  at the SINIT  module  for  our
platform (based on  Q45  chipset), suspecting that it
has something to do with  ability to detect fake VT-d
configuration.  It  turned  out  the  module  contains
regular  x86  code,  so  it  was  easy  for  us  to  disas-
semble and further analyze it.

6.

Inside the SINIT module

In  particular  the following code,  in  the SINIT  mod-
ule for  Q45  chipsets, turned  out  to be responsible
for  verifying  device  scopes  and  BAR  registers  in
the DMAR table:

mov     edi, es:MCHBAR
mov     esi, es:DMAR
add     esi, size ACPI_TABLE_DMAR
check DRHD_0:
mov     eax, [edi+0D40h]
and     eax, 0FFFFFFFEh
mov     edx, eax
pusha
mov     eax, 0D800h ; PCI device 0:1b.0
call    pci_read_word
cmp     bx, 0FFFFh
popa
jz      short check_DRHD1
cmp     eax, [esi+DMAR_DRHD.BAR]
jnz     BARs_mismatch
...
// perform other checks in this DRHD
...
check_DRHD_1:
mov     eax, [edi+0D00h]
and     eax, 0FFFFFFFEh
mov     ecx, eax
pusha
mov     eax, 1000h ; PCI device 0:2.0
call    pci_read_word
cmp     bx, 0FFFFh
popa
jz      short check_DRHD_2
cmp     eax, [esi+DMAR_DRHD.BAR]
jnz     BARs_mismatch
...
check_DRHD_2:
mov     eax, [edi+0D80h]
...
check_DRHD_3:
mov     eax, [edi+0DC0h]
and     eax, 0FFFFFFFEh
cmp     eax, [esi+DMAR_DRHD.BAR]
jnz     short BARs_mismatch
...

Because  we  knew  the  error  codes  that  SENTER
was returning when we tried to cheat  about DMAR
table,  it  was  rather  easy  to  locate  the  pieces  of
code  that likely  were  responsible for  detecting  the
VT-d misconfiguration.

We see here that if certain  PCI devices are present
(their  configuration  register  at  offset  0x0  doesnʼt
read  as  0xffff),  then  it is  assumed  that certain
DMA  remapping  unit  is  present,  and  the  corre-
sponding  DRHD  structure  for  this  remapping  unit

3 We have also tried more subtle attacks, that e.g. preserved the original number of DRHD structures, but only modified the BAR field or the Device Scope fields. In
any case SENTER was throwing various errors, about BAR mismatches or invalid device scopes.

4 It seems that the SINIT code is never loaded into DRAM, but rather only to the so called AC Execution Area, which seems to be located in the CPU cache.

should be verified. In the fragments above, one can
see e.g. that it is verified whether the Register Base
Address  field  (BAR)  reported  in  DRHD  structure
matches  the  one reported  by  the  chipset  in  some
(undocumented) fields of the MCHBAR region5.

In  the  case  of  a  Q45-based  system  we  used  for
testing the following  PCI devices were checked  in
order  to  establish  if  given  DMA  remapping  unit  is
present  and  if  given  DRHD  structure  in  the ACPI
DMAR table should be verified:

All other devices

We  see  there  are 4  DMA  remapping  units  in  this
system: one exclusive remapping unit for audio and
for  graphics,  yet  another  separate  unit  for  Intel
AMT/ME  device, and finally  the last one for  all  the
other devices in the system.

The role of the ACPI DMAR table

7.
One  could ask  why  do  we need  an  ACPI  DMAR
table, if the SINIT  module is  so smart that  it  could
figure  out  all  the  VT-d  hardware  configuration  by
just by querying the chipset?

Thatʼs true indeed that the SINIT  code, and conse-
quently the SENTER instruction, does not need any
help  from  the DMAR  table. However, all  the rest of
the  system  software,  in  particular  the  MLE  that  is
about to be started by SENTER, is not expected to
know  all  the specifics  of  the  platform,  and conse-
quently itʼs convenient to present information about
VT-d  hardware  configuration  in  some  unified,
chipset-independent way. And this is the role of the
DMAR ACPI table.

A careful reader  would, however,  point out that itʼs
insecure  for  MLE  to  relay  on  the  ACPI  tables.  As
we pointed out  earlier,  the ACPI tables  are neither
signed,  nor  protected by  BIOS  in  any way against
tampering.

To protect against tampering with DMAR table and
misleading  MLE  into  wrong  usage  of  VT-d,  the

SINIT  module, after it verifies the integrity of DMAR
table, copies it onto the so called TXT  heap, which
is  a  special  region  of  memory  that  is  protected
against tampering during and after secure launch.

Itʼs  important,  however,  for  the  developers  of  the
system  software  to  realize  this  security  problem
and  to  consciously  use  the  copy  of  DMAR ACPI
table from TXT  heap, rather  then  from BIOS mem-
ory.

As an  example, one of the developers of tboot, that
is  an  Intelʼs open  source implementation  of trusted
boot based on  TXT, and that  is  part of  the popular
Xen  hypervisor,  has  patched  this  problem  only  at
the beginning of this year  [6].

However,  back  to  our  attack,  the  situation  looks
pretty  secure today.  We  have a  smart SINIT  code
that  can  detect  any  potential  tampering  of  DMAR
table  introduced  before  SENTER   execution,  and
also we assume  the    system  software  is  properly
written  and  uses  a  copy  of  DMAR  table  from  the
TXT heap 6.

Is there a chance to still bypass TXT in that case?

8.

The bug in the SINIT module

It  turned  out  there  is  (obviously,  otherwise,  the
authors  would not be boring our  dear  readers  with
this little paper).

Letʼs  have  a  look  at  the  actual  code  used by  the
SINIT  module  that is used to read the base of  the
MCHBAR region  (which,  as we saw  before, is  ex-
tensively used for various checks of DMAR table):

pusha
mov    eax, 0x48 ; MCHBAR address
call   pci_get_long
and    ebx, 0xfffffffe
mov    DWORD PTR es:MCHBAR, ebx
cmp    ebx, 0xfec04000
ja     continue
mov    al, 0x4
mov    ah, 0xc

5 These are the fields at offsets 0xd40, 0d00, 0xd80 and 0xdc0. Interestingly those fields are not documented in the public chipset specification.

6 Obviously, we have also verified that it was not possible to modify the mentioned above undocumented chipset registers in the MCHBAR at offsets 0xd40, etc.
Most likely thay have been locked down by the BIOS.

The problem with  the code above will become clear
if we look  at  the chipset specification  for MCHBAR
register definition:

This is the base address for the (G)MCH Memory Mapped Configuration space. There is
no physical memory within this 16 KB window that can be addressed. The 16 KB
reserved by this register does not alias to any PCI 2.3 compliant memory mapped
space. On reset, the (G)MCH MMIO Memory Mapped Configuration space is disabled
and must be enabled by writing a 1 to MCHBAREN [Device 0, offset48h, bit 0].

All the bits in this register are locked in Intel TXT mode (82Q45/82Q43 GMCH only).

(G)MCH Memory Mapped Base Address (MCHBAR):
This field corresponds to bits 35:14 of the base address
(G)MCH Memory Mapped configuration space. BIOS will
program this register resulting in a base address for a
16 KB block of contiguous memory address space. This
register ensures that a naturally aligned 16 KB space is
allocated within the first 64GB of addressable memory
space. System Software uses this base address to program
the (G)MCH Memory Mapped register set.

MCHBAR Enable (MCHBAREN):

0 = MCHBAR is disabled and does not claim any memory

1 = MCHBAR memory mapped accesses are claimed and

It shows that the MCHBAR register is a  64-bit reg-
ister.  However,  the  code  accessing  this  register
used by the SINIT  module, is treating MCHBAR  as
if it was 32-bit long.

While  this  looks  innocent,  because  on  most  sys-
tems  the  MCHBAR  region  is  mapped  below  4GB
address, it might be abused by the attacker.

92

The attacker  can, indeed,  modify  the  value  of  the
MCHBAR  register  before  executing  SENTER   in-
struction. It can  be done via  a standard write to the
PCI configuration  space of the chipset (BDF 0:0.0,
register offset 0x48).

Datasheet

9.

The attack sketch

In  particular,  the  attacker  might  overwrite  the
MCHBAR register with the following value:

Y = (1 << 32) + X
where  X  is  a  32-bit  number.  This  way  the  SINIT
code  will  believe  that  the  MCHBAR   region
is
mapped at  the  memory  starting at  the address  X,
while  the  real  MCHBAR  region  will  be  mapped by
the chipset at the address Y.

Now,  letʼs  assume  the  attacker  managed  to  map
some  memory  at  address  X,  located  between
0xfec04000 and 0xffffffff  (see the condition
check  in the code above). In  that case the attacker
can  prepare  a  fake MCHBAR  region  at  this  lower
address.

The fake region will  be almost identical  to the origi-
nal  MCHBAR  region  (we can  just copy  a  block  of
memory7   mapped at  the  address  Y),  with  one  ex-

ception,  however.  Namely,  the  value  of  the  (un-
documented)  register  in  the  MCHBAR region,  that
holds the value of Register Base Address (BAR) for
the last DMA remapping unit #3 that covers most of
the  PCI devices in  our  system, will  be modified to
point to the BAR field of either  of the first three re-
mapping units, that are used to filter Audio, Graph-
ics, or ME devices respectively8.

Additionally,  we need to change the corresponding
BAR  field in  the ACPI  DMAR  table. This  way,  the
SINIT  code  will not be able to  realize that  there is
something wrong with the BAR field for  the last re-
mapping unit9.

As a result, both  SENTER and the system software
(e.g. Xen)  will be tricked into believing that the last
remapping  unit  has  its  configuration  registers
mapped  at  some  other  memory  location  (in  our
case where are the registers of the unit #0,  #1,  or
#2).  Consequently,  it  wonʼt  be  possible  for  the
SENTER instruction, and later for system software,
to properly  setup  VT-d permissions  for  most  of  the
PCI devices  in  the system, as most of the devices
are being handled by this last remapping unit.

This will result in the SENTER  completing success-
fully, and the MLE  initializing successfully,  but their
memory  will  not  be VT-d protected10. Now,  the  at-
tacker  can  use a  DMA attack, e.g. from  an  unprivi-
leged  VM  that  has  at  least  one  PCI  device  as-
signed to it (PCI pass-through) via  VT-d, and com-
promise the hypervisor, or other system software.

The attacker can  even  program  one of the PCI de-
vices before executing SENTER instruction in order
to schedule  a  malicious  DMA,  so  that  it  automati-
cally  subverted  the  newly  loaded hypervisor  just  a
moment after it gets loaded. In  that case no further
access to a driver domain will be needed.

10. Some details

For the attack  to work, the attacker must map  some
usable memory above 0xfec04000 address (but
still below 4G).

We  should  observe that even  if  the  target  system
has 4GB, or  more, of DRAM memory installed, still
no  physical  DRAM  is  mapped  in  the  window  be-

7 We copy 16kB of memory, starting at MCHBAR address.

8 In the case of our proof of concept attack described later, we chose to point to the BAR of the DRHD[0], although the DRHD[1], and DRHD[2] would be just as
good. Our DMA attack was using HDD controller, so neither of the first three DMA remapping units could be used to stop such an attack.

9 Perhaps the SINIT code could figure out that there are two different DMA remapping units in the system that use the same base addresses for mapping their
registers. But perhaps this is not something forbidden by the specification. Even if SINIT could detect such a situation as suspicious, we could point the BAR regis-
ter for the last remapping unit to some custom memory region.

10 Of course the values in the PCR registers 17 and 18 are not affected by the attack.

11. The Proof Of Concept

Below we present a  pseudo-code for a  working ex-
ploit  we  have  written  and tested  on  a  Q45-based
system.

The code below  should be executed before the se-
cure launch  is  started,  e.g.  as  part  of the MBR  or
boot loader, e.g. GRUB.

#define ETH_MEM 0xfef00000
#define FAKE_MCHBAR (ETH_MEM+0x10000)
#define NEW_MCHBAR ((1ULL<<32) +

FAKE_MCHBAR)

// map some memory above 0xfec00000...
pci_write_long (ETH_DEV, MBARA_REG,
ETH_MEM)

// copy original MCHBAR region there...
MCHBAR = pci_read_long (MCH_DEV,
MCHBAR_REG);
memcpy (FAKE_MCHBAR, MCHBAR&~1, 0x4000);

// do the trick!
DMAR = get_acpi_dmar_base();
DMAR.DRHD[3].BAR = DMAR.DRHD[0].BAR
*(FAKE_MCHBAR + 0xdc0) = DMAR.DRHD[3].BAR

// update MCHBAR...
pci_write_longlong (MCH_DEV, MCHBAR_REG,
NEW_MCHBAR | 0x1)

However, there is  a  window  of addresses  between
0xfef00000  and  0xffe00000  that  are  mapped
to  the  ICH  (southbridge).  Having  a  memory
mapped in  this range would satisfy the requirement
for  our  attack,  as  those  addresses  lay  above
0xfec04000.

We  have tested  our  exploit  code  on  both    a  Q35-
based  and  a  Q45-based  systems.  We  used  Xen
3.4.2  hypervisor,  with  the  most  recent  release  of
tboot [5], (tboot-20090330), together  with  the latest
SINIT  modules,  and  also  latest  versions  of  Intel
BIOS11.

12. Affected products

We  have  decided  to  use  a  network  card  device
(based  on  Intel  integrated  e1000e  chipset,  that  is
part  of  the  standard  Intel  ICH)  in  order  to  map
some memory.  It turned out that by  writing to cer-
tain  configuration  register  of  the  network  card
(MBARA),  we could make  a  substantial  amount of
memory  (64kB)  mapped  at  the  desired  address
range.

Intel®  TXT is a very new technology. The first desk-
top   machines  supporting  TXT  started  appearing
only  at  the  end  of  2007,  while  laptops  with  TXT
support have not been available before 2009. Con-
sequently very few products use TXT. One example
is the open source Xen hypervisor [7], that uses the
earlier  mentioned  tboot  for  implementing  TXT-
supported boot.

11 A word of caution for those brave users who would like to try TXT at home (even without exploiting anything). If you execute SENTER on a system which has a
too-old BIOS, that is not TXT-compatible, you risk... bricking your box (i.e. making it unbootable). This, in fact, happened to us a few times. We determined that this
happens when we reboot the machine without doing a proper SEXIT (e.g. Xen crashes as a result of us performing some attack, or perhaps because of the power
failure). In that case the Memory Controller Hub would assume that “secrets are still in memory” and would not let anybody talk to DRAM, even the BIOS, before a
special SCLEAN module is loaded and executed. Of course, a non-TXT-aware BIOS doesnʼt know it should execute some SCLEAN module. As a result BIOS
cannot access DRAM, which obviously doesnʼt allow to boot the platform. The only solution in this case seem to be desolder the SPI-flash from the motherboard,
and re-flash it with original image using an external flash programmer. Obviously, not the most entertaining activity one could wish for.

6

There  is  also  at  least  one  upcoming  commercial
product, Citrixʼs XenClient, that is said to make ex-
tensive use of Intel VT-d and TXT technologies [8].

We should stress, however, that if the virtualization
system  is  well  designed,  a  buggy  TXT  doesnʼt
automatically  render  the  system  useless  and  vul-
nerable.  Rather,  in  normal  circumstances,  the  at-
tacker  would  still  need  to  bypass  the  system-
imposed  protections  first  (e.g.  exploit  a  potential
bug in  the hypervisor). The difference that the TXT
makes, is that in the event of such  an attack, if the
attacker  tried to introduce any permanent  changes
to the system, e.g. subvert the hypervisor  or  Dom0
binaries on  disk, the TXT  would be able to prevent
such  a  subverted  system  from  booting  the  next
time.

However,  there  exist  scenarios  where  TXT  attack
can  be fatal  and  no  other  bug  in  the system  soft-
ware is required to undermine  security  of the plat-
form.

One such  case is when the systemʼs goal is to con-
tain a  potentially malicious user. As an  example we
can  consider  a  virtualization  system,  where  one of
the  virtual  machines  is  treated  as  “corporate”  VM,
while  other  VMs  might  be  the  userʼs  private  ma-
chines. The corporate IT  department might want to
grant  this  “corporate”  VM an  access  to  corporate
internal network  and servers (e.g. only the machine
that  positively  passes  Remote Attestation,  can  log
into  the  corporate  intranet),  but  at  the  same  time
might want to  forbid the  user  to  connect  any  USB
device to the “corporate” VM, in order to ensure the
employee  will  not  be  able  to  make  copies  of  the
companyʼs internal documents. This  is, in fact, one
of the goals of the earlier mentioned Citrixʼs upcom-
ing XenClient product [9].

For  the  above  scenario  TXT  is  absolutely  neces-
sary,  and  if  the  attacker  can  bypass  TXT  secure
launch,  e.g. using the exploit  presented in  this  pa-
per,  the  attacker  can  bypass  such  restrictions  at
will. And this all using an extremely cheap  software-
only attack12.

Another  scenario  where  TXT  circumvention  might
be fatal  is full disk  encryption, especially in  case of
laptops. Itʼs widely known  that a full disk  encryption
scheme that is not based on a trusted boot scheme
is  subject  to  trivial  attack  where  the  attacker  can

subvert e.g. the boot loader  in  order  to capture the
user  passphrase.  Later  the attacker  can  steal  the
encrypted  laptop   and  will  know  the  passphrase
needed to decrypt it. Such  attacks have been  dem-
onstrated in practice, see e.g. Evil Maid Attack [10].

It  is  thus  very  important  to  provide  some  form  of
trusted boot when  full  disk  encryption  is in  use. In-
tel®  TXT  is  a  good candidate, as it doesnʼt require
maintaing a  long chain of trust throughout the boot
process.  However,  an  attack  on  TXT  like the  one
presented in  this paper, can  be used to circumvent
such a trusted boot protection of full disk encryption
program, consequently leading to a successful “Evil
Maid”-like  attack,  with  potentially  fatal  conse-
quences.

13. Status of the SINIT vulnerability

We have informed  Intel about our discovery of  the
SINIT  implementation  error,  together  with  descrip-
tion how it could be exploited by an  attacker  to cir-
cumvent  TXT  secure  launch,  on  September  30,
2009. We then agreed to withhold the publication of
this  paper  until  Intel  fixes  the  problem  and  pub-
lishes updated SINIT  modules  and the appropriate
security advisory.

Intel has patched the SINIT  bug and published up-
dated SINIT modules on December 21, 2009 [11].

14. Summary

In this paper we have presented another attack  that
could be used to fully circumvent Intel Trusted Exe-
cution  Technology, specifically  its  core mechanism
for  secure late launch. This is the second attack  on
Intel®  TXT  our  team  has  disclosed  this  year,  with
the previous attack presented in February [1].

in

Our  research
this  area  demonstrates  that
hardware-aided  security  is  not  a  silver  bullet  and
that such hardware technologies can still be some-
times  attacked  using  software-only  attacks.  The
mere fact that some mechanism  is  implemented in
the  CPU  or  in  the  chipset,  doesnʼt  automatically
make it  secure  (see  also our  recent  work  on  Intel
AMT rootkits [12]).

We  (still)  believe,  however,  that  hardware  tech-
nologies, such  a  Intel VT-d and Intel®  TXT  are cru-
cial in building secure systems.

12 Of course, the person that is in a physical possession of the machine, e.g. laptop, can theoretically, always gain full control over the software executing on this
machine. In particular, such an attacker can e.g. replace the processor with a malicious processor that would allow for certain backdoors (e.g. ring3 to ring0 escala-
tion), or can retrieve the secrets stored in the TPM using electron microscope, or can perform active attacks on the LPC bug in order to reset the PCR17 and
PCR18 registers without executing the SENTER instruction, or can replace the DRAM chips with ones that would record the contents of the memory onto external
device. Such physical attacks are however considered very expensive to perform, often much more expensive than the data that are supposed to be protected by
such systems.

It  is  unavoidable  for  such  complex  technologies
such  Intel®  TXT  (and  we  also  think  Intel  VT-d)  to
contain  bugs.  But  there  is  a  lot  that  vendors,  like
Intel, could do to improve security of their products.
For  instance,  it  seems  to  be  a  rather  unfortunate
decision  to keep  certain  things  closed  source  and
undocumented,  e.g.  the  SINIT  module  internals.
Publishing  the  SINIT  source  code,  together  with
more  complete  information  about  the  chipset,  and
perhaps  even
then  microcode  used  by  the
SENTER  instruction,  would  likely  allow  more peo-
ple (besides  Intel  employees)  to better  review  the
security properties of those new technologies.

Intel is focused on ensuring the security of our customers computing environments. We are committed to rapidly addressing issues as they arise, and providing recommendations through security advisories and security [announcements](/content/www/us/en/security-center/announcement/default.html).

### Report a Vulnerability

If you have information about a security issue or vulnerability with an **Intel branded product or technology**, please send an e-mail to secure@intel.com. Encrypt sensitive information using our [PGP public key](/content/www/us/en/security-center/pgp-public-key.html).

Please provide as much information as possible, including:

* The products and versions affected
* Detailed description of the vulnerability
* Information on known exploits

A member of the Intel Product Security Team will review your e-mail and contact you to collaborate on resolving the issue. For more information on how Intel works to resolve security issues, see:

### Intel® Bug Bounty Program

Intel Corporation believes that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is a crucial part of identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in Intel products. Like other major technology companies, Intel incentivizes security researchers to report security vulnerabilities in Intel products to us to enable a coordinated response. To encourage closer collaboration with the security research community on these kinds of issues, Intel created its Bug Bounty Program. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in an Intel product or technology, we encourage you to notify us through our program and work with us to mitigate and to coordinate disclosure of the vulnerability.

Watch this video, [So You Found a Vulnerability](/content/www/us/en/security-center/so-you-found-a-vulnerability.html), to find out what you can expect when participating in the Intel® Bug Bounty Program.

### Intel Security Vulnerability Researcher Community Code of Conduct

The [Code of Conduct](/content/www/us/en/security-center/Code_of_Conduct.html) applies to all interactions among persons reporting or discussing security issues with Intel employees (‘Community Members’). It outlines the expected/acceptable standards of behavior, classifies some unacceptable behaviors, and describes possible enforcement actions for the Community Member interactions if unacceptable behavior arises during crowdsourced security vulnerability research such as the Intel® Bug Bounty Program, Project Circuit Breaker, vulnerability reporting, or any other communications interactions such as slack channels, email communication, or in person communications.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
