- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application has two distinct vulnerabilities. The first is an information disclosure vulnerability via `info.php`, which reveals sensitive server information. The second is a remote file disclosure vulnerability due to an insecure implementation in `download.php`, which allows arbitrary file retrieval from the server by manipulating the 'f' parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Information Disclosure (via `info.php`)
    - Remote File Disclosure (via `download.php`)
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker can obtain sensitive server information, which could be used to further compromise the system.
    - Remote File Disclosure: An attacker can access arbitrary files on the server, potentially including configuration files containing sensitive information like database credentials.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - HTTP GET request to `info.php` to trigger the information disclosure.
    - HTTP GET request to `modules/backup/download.php?f=../config.inc.php` (or similar path traversal) to trigger the remote file disclosure.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication or special privileges are required.
