```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application directly includes user-controlled input within SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection (SQLi) in `index.php`, `admin.php`, and `view.php` due to unsanitized GET parameters `c` and `id` used in SQL queries.",
    "Insecure Cookie Handling by setting an admin cookie `g_admin` with a hardcoded value and long expiration time without proper security measures."
   ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the vulnerable application to access, modify, or delete data within the database, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and its data. Additionally, the insecure cookie handling allows the attacker to gain admin privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests to `index.php` with a manipulated `c` parameter.",
    "HTTP GET requests to `view.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter.",
     "Manipulating the `g_admin` cookie value in the browser."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and have knowledge of SQL injection techniques and how to manipulate browser cookies."
