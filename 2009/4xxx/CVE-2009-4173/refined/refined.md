This document describes multiple vulnerabilities in Cute News and UTF-8 Cute News, and it is relevant to CVE-2009-4173 as it discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Cute News.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Reflected XSS:** Multiple instances in `index.php`, `register.php`, and `search.php`. These vulnerabilities require `register_globals` to be enabled and `magic_quotes` to be off. Attackers can inject malicious scripts via URL parameters.
        *   **Impact:** Stealing user cookies, potentially leading to account compromise.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript code.
        *   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to entice a user to click a specially crafted URL. Some XSS attacks also require a user to be logged in.
    *   **Stored XSS:**
        *   In News Comments: By inserting specially crafted `[link]` tags containing JavaScript in comments, which can then execute when a user interacts with the link.
            *   **Impact:** Malicious JavaScript execution when a user clicks the crafted link.
            *   **Attack Vector:** Posting a comment with the malicious markup.
            *  **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to leave comments.
        *   In News Articles: By including script tags in the body of news articles.
            *   **Impact:** Stealing user cookies, potentially leading to account compromise.
            *   **Attack Vector:** Posting a news article with malicious JavaScript code.
            *   **Required Capabilities:** Journalist, editor, or admin privileges to post an article, and the ability to have it approved by an admin if journalist level access.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    *   **Description:** Lack of protection against CSRF attacks. An attacker can trick an administrator into performing actions, such as creating a new admin account.
    *   **Impact:** Creation of new admin accounts.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Tricking an administrator into loading a specially crafted page (e.g., using an `<img>` tag with a malicious URL).
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Administrator to be logged in, and the ability to entice the admin to view a specially crafted page.
*   **File Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Description:**  An error in `search.php` discloses the full file path of the application.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of server path.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Sending specific, invalid parameters to `search.php`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to access the application.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   **Description:** Via the `skin` variable in the options module, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files. This can lead to arbitrary code execution by including log files with injected PHP code.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, arbitrary file viewing.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Modifying POST requests to include a path to the target file, combined with injecting PHP into server logs and then including the log file.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Administrator level access.
*   **Partial File Disclosure:**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerability in the `editnews` module allows for viewing partial contents of pipe-delimited files, such as the `users.db.php` file containing usernames. Another vulnerability allows viewing full user details including password hashes by manipulating the `source` parameter.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of usernames and password hashes.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Modifying the `source` parameter in the URL to include a path to the target file, combined with `%00` to truncate the path.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Editor or administrator level access.
*  **Authentication Bypass:** The advisory mentions insecure cookie handling where users are authenticated with each request by the username and password hash in the cookie.
*   **PHP Command Injection:**
    *   **Categories Module:** By injecting PHP code into the "Icon URL" or "Category Access" fields of a category, which will then be executed when `category.db.php` is accessed.
        *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Adding a category with malicious PHP code injected into specific fields.
        *   **Required Capabilities:** Administrator level access.
    *   **IP Ban Module:** By injecting PHP code in the `add_ip` parameter of the `ipban` module, which will then be executed when `ipban.php` is accessed.
        *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `add_ip` parameter.
        *  **Required Capabilities:** Administrator level access.
*   **Edit Any Article and Moderation Bypass:**
    *   **Description:**  Journalist and Editor level users can edit any article, allowing them to bypass moderation and inject malicious content.
    *   **Impact:** Allows bypassing moderation checks and can lead to stored XSS if malicious code is injected.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the id parameter to edit an article.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Journalist or Editor level access.

**Root Cause:**

*   Lack of input validation and sanitization in multiple areas.
*   Failure to implement CSRF protections.
*   Insecure handling of file paths, leading to LFI vulnerabilities.
*   Insufficient checks on user roles/privileges.
*   Insecure cookie handling and session handling.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Cute News 1.4.6
*   UTF-8 Cute News (all versions prior to UTF-8b)

**Patched Versions:**

*   UTF-8b
