Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4426:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `comment.php` and `view.php` files of Ignition 1.2. Specifically, the application directly includes files based on user-supplied input from the `blog` parameter in the URL without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. By manipulating the `blog` parameter, an attacker can force the application to include and execute arbitrary files from the server's local file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker could gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability can be used to read sensitive files from the server such as configuration files, source code, or database credentials, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests to the `comment.php` and `view.php` scripts.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL by modifying the `blog` parameter to include file paths that lead to sensitive or malicious files on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable Ignition 1.2 application.
*   **Knowledge of System Paths:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess file paths on the target server in order to perform file inclusion.
*   **PHP `magic_quotes_gpc` off:** The exploit requires that the server has the PHP `magic_quotes_gpc` setting turned off.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the following code snippets within the PHP scripts:

    *   `comment.php`: `include ('posts/'.$_GET['blog'].'.txt');`
    *   `view.php`: `include ('posts/'.$_GET['blog'].'.txt');`

*   The provided proof of concept URLs demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerability:

    *   `http://[attacked_box]/[ignition1.2]/comment.php?blog=../../../../[local_file]%00`
    *   `http://[attacked_box]/[ignition1.2]/view.php?blog=../../../../../[local_file]%00`

    The `../../` sequences are used for path traversal to access files outside the `posts/` directory. The `%00` is a null byte which is used to truncate the file name, which prevents the `.txt` extension from interfering with the LFI.
