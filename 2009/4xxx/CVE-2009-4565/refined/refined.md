{
  "CVE-2009-4565": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability exists in sendmail where it does not properly handle a '\\0' character in the Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate. This can allow an attacker to spoof arbitrary SSL-based SMTP servers using a crafted server certificate, and to bypass access restrictions using a crafted client certificate.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient input validation of the Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates when establishing SSL connections.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of null characters in certificate CN fields.",
      "Lack of proper sanitization or validation of X.509 certificate data."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can perform man-in-the-middle attacks by spoofing SSL/TLS servers and potentially bypass intended access controls.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via crafted server certificates.",
       "Remote exploitation via crafted client certificates."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious X.509 certificate during the SSL/TLS handshake process."
  }
