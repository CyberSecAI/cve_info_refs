The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in TotalCalendar 2.4: Blind SQL Injection and Local File Inclusion.

**Blind SQL Injection:**

*   **Root cause:** The `selectedCal` parameter in `rss.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data extraction, modification, or deletion.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `rss.php` with a malicious `selectedCal` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Local File Inclusion (LFI):**

*   **Root cause:** The `box` parameter in `box_display.php` is vulnerable to LFI.
*   **Weaknesses:** The application does not validate or sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to include local files.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `box_display.php` with a malicious `box` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
