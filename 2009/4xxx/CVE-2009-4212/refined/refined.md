{
  "CVE-2009-4212": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer underflow bugs in the AES and RC4 decryption operations of the crypto library within the MIT Kerberos software.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer underflow in the AES and RC4 decryption routines which leads to heap corruption.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a crash, heap corruption, or under unlikely conditions, arbitrary code execution on the KDC (Key Distribution Center) server, potentially compromising the entire system or cause a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted AES or RC4 encrypted ciphertext to the KDC.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted encrypted message to the KDC server."
