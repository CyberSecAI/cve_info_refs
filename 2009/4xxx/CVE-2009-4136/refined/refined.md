{
  "CVE-2009-4136": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is caused by index functions changing session-local state. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a table with attached indexes that reference attacker-created functions. Subsequent maintenance operations performed by superusers will then execute these functions, which can modify session-local state in a way that subverts later operations in the same session.",
    "Root cause": "Index functions changing session-local state.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper control of session-local state changes via index functions."
      ],
    "Impact": "Privilege escalation, potentially leading to subversion of superuser sessions. Attackers could modify session settings, replace prepared statements, or alter the search path to execute malicious code.",
    "Attack vectors": "Authenticated database users can create tables with indexes referencing malicious functions.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated database user to create the malicious table and functions."
  }
