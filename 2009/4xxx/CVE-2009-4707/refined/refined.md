The provided content is a security advisory for TYPO3, specifically `TYPO3-SA-2009-010`, which details multiple vulnerabilities found in various third-party extensions.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Affected Extensions:** CoolURI, Reset backend password, datamints Newsticker, [Gobernalia] Front End News Submitter, Myth download, Tour Extension, Webesse Image Gallery
    *   **Root Cause:** Unsanitized user input used directly in SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to potentially read, modify, or delete data in the database, bypass authentication, and potentially gain control of the application.
    *  **Attack Vectors:** Malicious SQL code injected through web forms or other input points.
    * **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires ability to send crafted requests to the vulnerable extension, typically via the web interface.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Affected Extensions:** [Gobernalia] Front End News Submitter, Mailform, Twitter Search
    *   **Root Cause:**  User-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being displayed in a web page.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Injecting malicious JavaScript or HTML through input fields or URL parameters.
     * **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to inject malicious input to the extension.

*   **Blind SQL Injection:**
    *  **Affected Extension:** Myth download
    * **Root Cause:** Similar to SQL Injection, but the application doesn't output the results of the query. Instead, the attacker must infer information from the application's behavior, which may take longer to exploit.
    *  **Impact:** Allows attackers to extract data from the database, even when no errors are directly shown.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  Injected through web input to the extension.
     * **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires ability to send crafted requests to the vulnerable extension, typically via the web interface.

*   **Information Disclosure, Path Traversal:**
    *   **Affected Extension:** Webesse E-Card
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly validate file paths, potentially allowing access to restricted files.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows attackers to access sensitive information or files outside the intended directory.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating file paths in the request to access restricted files.
     * **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send crafted requests to the vulnerable extension, typically via the web interface.

**Affected Extensions and Versions:**
The advisory lists specific vulnerable extensions and their affected version ranges.  Notably, the advisory states that some extensions were removed from the TYPO3 extension repository because the authors could not be contacted to provide updates.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Updates:** For extensions with available updates, users are advised to upgrade to the specified fixed versions.
*   **Removal:** For extensions without available updates, users are advised to uninstall and delete the extension files.
*   **General Advice:**  The advisory recommends following the TYPO3 SECURITY Guide and subscribing to the `typo3-announce` mailing list for security updates.

**Credits:**
The advisory gives credit to the individuals who discovered and reported each vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory introduces the concept of "Collective Security Bulletins" (CSBs) for less critical extensions to reduce the workload of the TYPO3 Security Team.
*   It clearly states that all vulnerabilities are in third-party extensions, not the TYPO3 core.
*   The advisory provides links to the fixed versions of the extensions on the TYPO3 extension repository.
