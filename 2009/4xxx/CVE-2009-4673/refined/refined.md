- **Server Compromise:** In some instances, SQL injection can lead to further compromise of the server.
- **Application Takeover:** An attacker could potentially gain control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `profile.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft malicious queries.
- **Magic Quotes Off:** The provided exploit requires that magic quotes be disabled on the PHP server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit provided uses a `UNION SELECT` SQL injection technique to extract database information.
- This vulnerability is associated with another CVE (CVE-2009-3358) in the provided content.
