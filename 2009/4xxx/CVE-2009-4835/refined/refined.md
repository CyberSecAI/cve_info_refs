{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check for zero values before division operations in multiple audio format handling functions within libsndfile. Specifically, the reported functions are `htk_read_header`, `alaw_init`, `ulaw_init`, `pcm_init`, `float32_init`, and `sds_read_header`. These functions perform divisions using values derived from the input audio files, and if the crafted file causes any of these values to be zero, it leads to a division by zero.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Divide by zero error",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability. A crafted audio file can trigger a SIGFPE signal (floating-point exception), causing the application using libsndfile to crash. Repeated crashes could lead to an effective denial of service for the application or system using libsndfile.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted audio files. An attacker could provide a malicious audio file to an application using libsndfile, triggering the vulnerability.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide an application that uses `libsndfile` with a specially crafted audio file. No specific privileges are required."
