Package: libsndfile1
Version: 1.0.20-1
Severity: normal
Tags: security

Hi,

I have discovered six different SIGFPE crashes with crafted input
files in libsndfile. Triggering input files are attached.

The crashes are:

1) in htk.c:198 (htk_read_header), divisor sample_period can be 0.

2) in alaw.c:72 (alaw_init), divisor psf->blockwidth can be 0.

3) in ulaw.c:62 (ulaw_init), divisor psf->blockwidth can be 0.

4) in pcm.c:274 (pcm_init), divisor psf->blockwidth can be 0.

5) in float32.c:244 (float32_init), divisor psf->blockwidth can be 0.

6) in sds.c:279 (sds_read_header), psds->bitwidth can be 0, resulting
   in divisor ((psds->bitwidth + 6) / 7) getting the value of 0.

Run for example sndfile-info (from the sndfile-programs package) with
one of these files as parameter to see the crash.

I don't know what the security impact is, but since I assume
libsndfile is used by lots of applications for data obtained from
untrusted sources, I thought I'd tag this security. In any case it
should be at most denial of service. Untag if you think it's not
securitywise important.

Seems the debian bug tracker filtered them out. Can you please  send
them directly to me?

Denial of service but not much else.

I even removed the security tag. libsndfile is no service so
speaking of denial of service here is a bit too much. This
is just a regular application bug.

This bug seems to have been fixed for some time. No divide by zero
on any of these file with libsndfile-1.0.21-3.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
