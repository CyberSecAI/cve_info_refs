Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2009-4642:

While none of the documents directly mention CVE-2009-4642, they describe a vulnerability and related issues in `gnome-screensaver` where it fails to activate automatically due to changes in how it detects user inactivity. This could be considered a security issue as it prevents the screen from locking, potentially exposing sensitive information.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

    *   `gnome-screensaver` started relying on `gnome-session` for idle detection.
    *   If `gnome-session` is not running (e.g., in XFCE or other non-GNOME environments), `gnome-screensaver` cannot determine idle time and fails to activate.
    *   A related issue involves applications that "inhibit" the screensaver but don't properly release the inhibit, thus preventing the screensaver from ever activating.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

    *   Dependency on `gnome-session` creates a single point of failure.
    *   Failure to handle situations where `gnome-session` is unavailable.
    *   Improper handling of screensaver "inhibit" requests from other applications.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**

    *   The screen does not lock automatically after a period of inactivity.
    *   Sensitive information displayed on the screen may be exposed to unauthorized individuals.

*   **Attack Vectors:**

    *   An attacker could simply wait for the user to leave their computer unattended.
    *   An attacker could potentially exploit an application to leave the screensaver in an inhibited state.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

    *   Physical access to the unattended computer.

**Additional Details and Context:**

*   The issue was prominent in Ubuntu Karmic (9.10) and possibly other distributions using `gnome-screensaver` without `gnome-session`.
*   Users reported inconsistent behavior, where the screensaver would sometimes work after a reboot but later fail.
*   Some users tried workarounds like downgrading to older versions of `gnome-screensaver` or switching to `xscreensaver`.  However, `xscreensaver` also presented its own configuration challenges.
*   Patches were attempted, but the issue was complex and had multiple contributing factors. Some patches addressed specific scenarios (e.g., handling of inhibit requests), but did not fully resolve the core problem of the dependency on `gnome-session`.
*   The issue was ultimately marked as "Won't Fix" by both the GNOME and XFCE projects, as each considered it the other's responsibility to address the incompatibility.
