I've configured the screensaver to start after 5 minutes. However this does not happen. In Gnome it works ok.

I'm suspecting that it might have the same cause of these bugreports:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=538790>

Which maybe be caused by this change in gnome-screensaver:
<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=567919>

Is gnome-screensaver actually running?

I have no intention of adding private API to xfce4-session for getting idle time.  The X server provides this.  If gnome-screensaver can't figure out idle time on Xfce, then gnome-screensaver is buggy.

Your problem is caused by gnome-screensaver now requiring gnome-session to run to get it's idle time. There doesn't seem to be any reason for this change in gnome-screensaver (except, maybe, causing more trouble to non-GNOME users who want to use gnome-screensaver).

Thanks for the comments. This pretty much sucks as I like to run gnome-screensaver and not xscreensaver.

Yes, it definitely suck, but there's not much one can do, exept asking for GNOME people to revert the change and stay with the X idle counter.

D-Bus is a very important message system, but in many places (like the case of gnome-screen-saver), it is abused, causing lot of problems and hidden runtime dependencies.

Another trivial stuff was moved from gnome-screen-saver (and gpm also) to the gnome session is the ability of inhibiting automatic DPMS activation on idle (or automatic sleeps for gpm), so no way for a media player to prevent gnome screen saver from switching off the screen if gnome session isn't running, this definitely sucks, i think is time to have our own screen saver application.

What about a GTK+ front-end to Xscreensaver's unlock dialog? It's not gonna be easy but it will be possibly more secure than gnome-screensaver and kscreensaver. See <http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/toolkits.html>

Unless you're an X11 security expert, I don't think it's a good idea (exactly for the stuff explained in the above page)

By studying the source for gnome-screensaver it seems to be these 3 functions in gs-watcher-x11.c which would need a rewrite:
static void
on_presence_status_changed (DBusGProxy    *presence_proxy,
                            guint          status,
                            GSWatcher     *watcher)
static void
on_presence_status_text_changed (DBusGProxy    *presence_proxy,
                                 const char    *status_text,
                                 GSWatcher     *watcher)
static gboolean
connect_presence_watcher (GSWatcher *watcher)

Eg. rewrite connect_presence_wather to optain idle signal from another source than gnome-session and adjust the two callbacks to reflect this change.
```

This is getting a bit out of scope for this bug.  If you want to complain about gnome-screensaver's deficiencies, you'll need to file a bug on bugzilla.gnome.org.  Nothing is going to get solved here.

Hi,

As mentionned in the Gnome Bugzilla [0] (and other related bugs), I've had the same problem with my simple Fvwm-based environment and ended up writing a Python script which impersonates  the Gnome SessionManager, and does the XIDLE detection for Gnome ScreenSaver. It's available from [1], and the code is documented at [2].

Is there any more info needed?

I already reseted gconf settings for both screensaver and power-manager (when in alpha3) but the behaviour stays the same. Screensaver activates correctly if forced (either by locking screen or with "gnome-screensaver-command -a"), but it appears the idle time detection is not working as it doesn't activate by timeout. Screen blanking (DPMS) never activates by timeout also.

When I run "gnome-screensaver-command -a", although screensaver activates correcly I see the folloing reply in the prompt:

$ gnome-screensaver-command -a

\*\* (gnome-screensaver-command:10180): WARNING \*\*: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod raised:

 Method "SetActive" with signature "b" on interface "org.gnome.ScreenSaver" doesn't exist

I filed a report about similar behavior a few days ago when upgrading from ibex to jaunty and then to karmic, where my screensaver stopped working correctly. Running gnome-screensaver in debug as you did, I see no events at the one minute mark, which the timeout is set to. Using gnome-screensaver-command -a as you did put my screensaver into proper fade out as I'd expect at the timeout, without the error.

One thing I did notice is restarting gnome-screensaver in debug, while waiting for the screensaver to kick in, all of a sudden I did get a DMPS shutdown of the screen, which hadn't occurred at the timeout interval either. I had upgraded yesterday to an updated build of gnome-power-manager (2.27.5-0ubuntu2) supposedly resolving the timeout issue, but did infact not. I did restart it, but not gnome-screensaver, so at least DMPS seems to be behaving, still not gnome-screensaver.

I think the two are somehow related, but I'm not certain if gnome-screensaver and gnome-power-manager use the same event engine (hal,dbus?) to signal "idle" state, or from xorg itself that may be broken. Seems gnome-screensaver just isn't figuring itself to ever go idle, while they fixed whatever it was in GPM. Now that I just tested the DMPS timeout again, I see it's not working again either.

FWIW, another system recently upgraded to Jaunty has variable issues with gnome-screensaver not always turning on at the set timeout as well, really almost random when it works or doesn't. Almost exactly the same output as this one on karmic.

purging gnome-screensaver obviously didnt enable the screensaver, but now the dpms power off stuff works properly, and consistant with what it would have done with gnome screensaver.

I think it's a bit more important than "low" as it directly relates to security of my laptop, but I'll leave it to team interpretation.

I finally got tired of waiting on a fix and just forced install of the jaunty packages that work perfectly:

<http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gnome-screensaver/>

gnome-screensaver\_2.24.0-0ubuntu6

<http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gnome-power-manager/>

gnome-power-manager\_2.24.2-2ubuntu8

I cart my laptop into some hostile environments, and need to rely on my workstation locking in a timely fashion.

Yep, that's right... Now the screensaver activates as expected.

Just DPMS doesn't work yet, but that may be a problem of gnome-power-manager and not gnome-screensaver...

I am reprioritizing the bug because a) the sole functions of the program are to provide a screensaver and lock the screen, neither of which work and b) the lack of screen locking is a security issue.

I am still seeing this issue with the following:

$ dpkg -l|egrep 'gnome-(screen|power)'

ii gnome-power-manager 2.27.91-0ubuntu1 power management tool for the GNOME desktop

ii gnome-screensaver 2.27.0-0ubuntu5 GNOME screen saver and locker

What happens on my machine is that after a minute, the screen will blank for a second, then come back to the desktop. After first logging in it worked properly once, but then not after that.

could you try if that's still an issue in current karmic? Jamie your comment seems a different issue than the dbus one, can you look the screen using ctrl-alt-l?

In Karmic at present, the screen saver or blank screen has started working for me, but putting the display to sleep (as set in Power Management) does not function.

I still see this problem on today's Karmic.

Ctrl+Alt+L locks the screen, but the screen will never go into power-save mode later on (it has been like this for most of the Karmic cycle).

ctrl+alt+l works, and actually the last two days I have seen the screen lock and the display put to sleep. I am not entirely confident that the bug is fixed (see Martijn's comment), partially because it would sometimes work for a while and then not. I will report back if/when it fails.

Well after more than a week of testing, I have not seen this faulty behavior. The screensaver works and so does turning off the screen. AFAIC, it is fixed.

My DPMS still doesn't work and is probably a problem with gnome-power-manager. Any ideas of clues I can collect for diagnosing more effectively?

Hey, I still have this problem on up-to-date karmic Xubuntu amd64!

The screensaver doesn't start automatically, but works correctly if I run `gnome-screensaver-command -a' or lock the screen with Ctrl+Alt+Del.

Screen blanking is working correctly in the meantime.

I have the same problem for a Karmic with gnome. Screensaver does not start automatically, but 'gnome-screensaver-command -a' starts it. It worked fine in Jaunty.

I am also having this issue and as stated above, view this as a security issue as I also require the display to "auto" lock itself in a timely manner while I am away from my machines. I opened a bug on this myself yesterday, however I stumbled across this already on going one. Therefore, I have flagged mine as a duplicate in regards to this one. [Bug #473801](/bugs/473801). I have the most recent packages installed as well.

gnome-power-manager -- 2.28.1-0ubuntu1

gnome-screensaver -- 2.28.0-0ubuntu3

And I also never saw this problem in Jaunty or previous.

Browsing around with gconf-editor I noticed that there are 2 keys called idle\_delay. On of them is /apps/gnome-screensaver/idle\_delay and the other is /desktop/gnome/session/idle\_delay. It is the latter one that is changed when moving the slider labeled "regard computer as idle after:" in the screensaver prefs GUI. Changing the other value with gconf-editor seems to help the problem but it still seems kind of hit or miss.

Ugh. This bug is back. This was previously sorted sometime in the karmic dev cycle, but now after release I am affected by this again. At the set time to activate the screensaver, my screen dims to black as if about to start the screensaver, then snaps back to full display brightness.

Due to the security issues involved, is it possible to issue a regression back down to the known working packages from Jaunty until this can be resolved? As of now, I have to SSH to all affected Karmic boxes from my iBook and forcibly shut down the displays. If this is not possible, could someone kindly show me how to forcibly purge the Karmic packages and install the Jaunty ones? I see this was done by a user above, any issues to report with this?

I've discovered upon a fresh reboot, if you do not touch gconf at all and let the system idle. The first instance of the screen saver/power manager appears to work. Over the course of time, the randomness comes back and is ultimately followed by nothing working at all. Could we be looking at a memory/resource issue?

I ran some updates including the proposed repositories and thus far, it seems like the issue has corrected itself ... I'm not going to call it just yet, although so far the screensaver has started when it should and the displays have shutdown when they should. I will continue to monitor for a few days just to be sure.

Agreed, I think a regression would be in order due to the security implications related to this. I currently have to start the screensaver manually and then use xset from my Mac to shutdown the displays remotely.

upgraded to Karmic. I have the bug on the upgraded machine and one fresh

So, to sum up Kevin's post above (comment 42), the fix for this bug is for Ubuntu to apply the following two patches to their version of X:

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/patch/?id=db568f9eabf3450d8a023597ff007df355b13ea8>

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/patch/?id=6b5978dcf1f7ac3ecc2f22df06f7000f360e2066>

This will stop X from resetting IDLECOUNTER when DPMS off is sent, which turns the screen back on right after it shuts off.

And will those two commits explain all of the different behaviours here

including everything works fine at times yet at other times, the

screensaver never kicks in and yet other times, the screen saver kicks

in but never DPMSes off?

This started happening on my AMD 64 X4 w/ 4G in the past couple of weeks. It is consistent, in that the screensaver never kicks in and power saver never turns off display (but I can run the command in a terminal and it works). I didn't go digging in bug reports at first because, as such an in-your-face problem, I figured it would be fixed in short order. Is there anything I can do to help? e.g. report hardware specs? list versions, etc.?

That bug seems like it would only occur after running totem, which

doesn't seem to be the case here. (At least I don't run totem -- I

use vlc.)

Could you please try the gnome-screensaver packages in the following PPA once they've finished building:

[https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur/+archive/screen-locking](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur/%2Barchive/screen-locking)

Even if you don't use totem, it could be when totem is used as a firefox plugin, or it could be another application that crashed with inhibit activated.

Thanks!

Thanks for trying to do something. This doesn't fix the problem on my

laptop, though.

It must be something else. I'd really like to try tracking this down,

but have no clue where to start. Could anyone suggest, please?

Well, so far so good for me. I applied the update, rebooted, changed the screensaver settings to 1 minute, waited and it came on. Moved the mouse to shut it off, played some video files, went to some web pages, stopped activity again for a minute, and the screen saver engaged again. I've tried a bunch of other tests, and each time the screensaver now comes on. Maybe others need to completely reboot?

OK, I can confirm this. On a fresh installation of xubuntu, gnome-screensaver never get triggered by the idle timeout.

Is anyone else having issues with gnome-screensaver that is \_not\_ using xubuntu and is still seeing issues with the gnome-screensaver package in my PPA?

Basically, the newer gnome-screensaver uses gnome-session for the idle timeout. Xubuntu doesn't use gnome-session, so gnome-screensaver doesn't work. Here is the upstream bug report for the issue:

Hey, I've just removed gnome-screensaver and installed xscreensaver instead. It doesn't work either!

Can it be something is broken on some lower level?

I've re-logged in, checked that xscreensaver process is running, adjusted settings to activate after 1 minute of idle time--and it didn't work, just like before. Still it can be activated with Ctrl+Alt+Del three finger salute.

On an aside note, couldn't we patch gnome-screensaver to fallback to earlier behaviour if it sees that gnome-session isn't running?

Sorry, it looks like your fix doesn't apply to me since I'm using xfce. Sorry to waste your time. I wonder what mythbuntu users are supposed to do about this now.

OK, I've moved the gnome-screensaver issue when used with xfce (xubuntu, mythbuntu) into [bug #493573](/bugs/493573) so it doesn't get lost when this bug gets closed.

Still broken here after applying update and rebooting. Screen fades to black at correct timeout, but screensaver is not displayed. Instead, the display snaps back to full brightness immediately.

Filed [Bug #494114](/bugs/494114) hoping it does get properly looked at. Unfortunately, I followed this bug throughout karmic dev cycle and at one point around end of August the screensaver was completely functional. Looks like I've had a different bug for some time now.

If your screen starts to fade at the correct idle timeout, but the screensaver is not shown, please do refer to my aforementioned bug.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=592093#c0)  Tony Houghton    2009-08-17 14:11:09 UTC  ``` Since #567919 was resolved gnome-screensaver has started relying on gnome-session for idle detection. Please could gnome-screensaver's own idle detection code be restored and used either via a command-line option or if it doesn't get a response from gnome-session. I prefer to use ROX-Session, but I used gnome-screensaver and gnome-power-manager because of the useful dual timeout settings for battery and AC on laptops. Now that combination doesn't work :-(. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=592093#c1)  charlesantispam-gnome    2009-12-15 22:38:33 UTC  ``` It also causes gnome-screensaver to be broken under xfce (<http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5927>) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=592093#c2)  William Jon McCann    2010-01-29 02:57:33 UTC  ``` I'd say that the xfce session should probably do something like gnome-session.  Either that or an external module that implements the same dbus interface.  I don't think we are going to fix this.  This is the gnome screensaver after all :) ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=592093#c3)  Olivier Mehani    2011-05-17 14:48:43 UTC  ``` Hi,  I've had the same problem with my simple Fvwm-based environment. I ended writing a Python script which fakes the Gnome SessionManager, and does the XIDLE detection for Gnome ScreenSaver. It's available from [0], and the code is documented at [1].  It find it a bit annoying, though, that Gnome becomes so much integrated that its components become harder or impossible to be use on their own ):  [0] <https://scm.narf.ssji.net/svn/shtrom/browser/default-env/bin/SessionManager.py> [1] <http://www.narf.ssji.net/~shtrom/wiki/projets/gnomescreensavernosession> ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=592093#c4)  Hans Deragon    2011-12-30 02:29:17 UTC  ``` Here is a scenario where this gnome-screensaver should support other graphical environments.  Like many, I switched to XFCE because as a power user, I feel I am more productive in a classical, fully customizable environment than under Gnome 3 with Gnome Shell or Unity.  However, my laptop is also shared by members of my family, which use Gnome 3 with Unity.  xsreensaver does not provide any means to switch between users.  gnome-screensaver does.  This is why I want to use gnome-screensaver; when my screen is locked, someone else can use the computer login into their own account.  As a nice side effect, gnome-screensaver is esthetically more pleasing too.  Granted, I could go and ask xscreensaver developers to provide the same functionality, but gnome-screensaver already has all the code and I believe that adding the idle detection code would be easier. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=592093#c5)  Hans Deragon    2012-01-02 14:43:59 UTC  ``` With embarrassment I must admit that xscreensaver does provide a mean to switch user.  I just realized that there is a button named "new login" that xscreensaver provide, but it never dawn on me that it meant "switch user".    However, it would be nice that the same interface for locking the screen and switch user be provided regardless of the user interface used by the currently logged in user.  Gnomescreensaver could be that piece of software. ``` |  |

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: xfce4-session

Under a XFCE desktop (including xubuntu and mythbuntu), gnome-screensaver never activates after the idle timeout expires.

Basically, the newer gnome-screensaver uses gnome-session for the idle timeout. Xubuntu doesn't use gnome-session, so gnome-screensaver doesn't work. Here is the upstream bug report for the issue:

<http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5927>

What is gnome-screensaver doing is non-sense... We should just switch to xscreensaver, instead of adapting xfce4-session.

When I first discovered the bug, I installed xscreensaver as my first workaround. However, the screensaver was activated when I was watching TV. So it seemed like I moved from one bug to another. Has anyone else successfully configured xscreensaver to work?

This was reported all the back in alpha testing, but has never been fixed. It seems like every month, someone else reports it as if it is a new discovery! Why not just go back to the original bug report, <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/397892> . Perhaps someone could kill that one? Or, better yet, change it to a duplicate of all these new ones ?

Let's track gnome-screensaver under xubuntu and mythbuntu here, as the other bug reports all seem to have multiple different issues in them.

The 12/7 update for gnome-screensaver did not, as expected, fix this issue with xfce.

If xfce is not going to be adapted, and gnome-screensaver is not going to be reverted, then switching to xscreensaver (or to Ubuntu) seems to be the only workaround for the time being (but based on what I've read, there might be some minor issues after doing this, like the "lock screen" buttons not working anymore).

I would appreciate a statement from Canonical on this matter.

It might be worth marking this as a security issue, as was done with the other bug report on gnome-screensaver failing to activate, because automatic screen locking is now broken. Unfortunately, I don't know how to mark it as such.

I have unactivated, killed and set up not to load at boot the gnome-screensaver daemon, and I have installed, configured and set up to load at boot the xscreensaver module. The good news is that the "lock screen" button works as before without the need of any intervention. I've left the Screensaver shortcut alone in the options menu (it still points to gnome's); there's a shortcut to xscreensaver options in the System menu. Now xscreensaver kicks in as expected after the specified amount of idle time, the screen locks as expected, and xscreensaver's power saving options seem to work as well (the display goes blank after a given time of screensaver activity). The only difference is that of course the unlock with password screen is different from gnome's. At the moment I see no particular problems in replacing gnome-screensaver with xscreensaver. Of course if the former will be "fixed" I'll consider switching back, but for the time being, this will do.

The upstream bug isn't at xfce (as they say: If you want to complain about

gnome-screensaver's deficiencies, you'll need to file a bug on

However, there is this entry at gnome:

yes, xfce says "won't fix" and gnome-screensaver also says "won't fix" (<https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=592093>)... It's just sad to see how people don't care how their softs can be used in other configurations...

So let's go back using xscreen-saver.

Sorry but I don’t understand what you mean. You can use French if you
can’t explain yourself in English.

This means you don’t have gnome-session 2.26. Whatever your problem is,
is it solved by upgrading gnome-session to the version in unstable?

Excusez moi pour mon niveau d'anglais.

Le problème est que gnome-screesaver ne met pas l'ordinateur en état inactif
et gnome power-manager ne peut pas mettre l'écran en veille si inactif

Je n'ai pas put installé gnome-session 2.26 a cause des dépendances de xorg,
mais j'ai installé gnome-session-bin 2.26 et désinstaller gnome-session 2.22.
En démarrant sur la session de secours gnome, gnome-screesaver fonctionne très bien.
Donc le problème vient de gnome-session 2.22.

Cordialement (Best regards).

gnome-screensaver is as a matter of fact useful without gnome at all; I
use it as my screensaver on top of the ion3 window manager and it has
been working very well for a while now. I'd like to be able to continue
using it without pulling in a bunch of dependencies on gnome via
gnome-session. Could this dependency be downgraded to a recommends or
suggests since it doesn't actually *require* gnome-session?

Thanks,
jwatzman

I understand your concern and I’d like to remove this requirement as
well. The problem is that gnome-screensaver now relies on gnome-session
for the computation of idle time. If it can’t compute idle time, it is
useless since the screen won’t lock automatically.

Fixing this correctly requires including the old code conditionally,
when the gnome-session D-Bus interface is not available. If you can
provide a tested patch to that effect, I think it would be worth
including.

Cheers,

Subject: gnome-screensaver: Only gnome-session-bin is needed
Date: Sun, 19 Jul 2009 07:06:51 -0600
```
Package: gnome-screensaver
Version: 2.26.1-2
Severity: normal

Since adding the gnome-session dependency, it seems a full gnome session
is started just to get the screensaver.  While gnome-session is now
required for the screensaver to detect idle time, only the
gnome-session-bin package is really required.  I was using
gnome-session-bin with gnome-screensaver and the awesome window manager
without any problems.
