Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `form.php` script of WebMember 1.0. The `formID` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL code into the `formID` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database.  The provided exploit specifically targets the `email` and `password` fields from the `mem_user` table, which could lead to user account compromise.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can allow attackers to modify or delete data, or potentially gain further access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `form.php` script.
*   **Manipulated URL Parameter:** The `formID` parameter in the URL is manipulated to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WebMember application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious SQL injection payload.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** Knowledge of SQL is needed to craft the malicious injection payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `mem_user` table.
*   It uses `concat_ws(0x3e,email,password)` to concatenate email and password with a `>` separator.
*   The exploit uses `--` to comment out the rest of the SQL query.
*   The exploit uses `-100` in `formID` to cause the SQL query to return no results initially and be replaced with the injection results.

**Additional Notes:**
* The Exploit-DB entry provides a full exploit payload and a live demo URL.
* The prefix of the table is noted as `mem` which might be helpful for attackers.
*  The application has a registration requirement, which the attacker must bypass before the injection is possible.
