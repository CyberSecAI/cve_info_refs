Description:
MySQL Connector/Net is missing the capability to validate the server's certificate when using encryption.  This makes it possible to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack against the connection, which defeats the security provided by SSL.

How to repeat:
Install untrusted certificates on the MySQL server.  They work just as well as trusted ones.

The issue is also easily seen in the source code.  In NativeDriver.cs, the StartSSL function relies on a validation function called "NoServerCheckValidation" which does what its name implies: no validation of any kind.  There is another function called "ServerCheckValidation" but it is commented out.

Suggested fix:
Connector/ODBC has the validation capability and it is possible to configure it with options such as sslverify and sslcapath.  Providing similar options in Connector/Net would be a good solution.
```

Hi Wes and thanks for your report. I am aware of this problem but let me see if I can dig out more info.
```

[13 Aug 2008 11:27]
Tonci Grgin
```
Wes, I must admit this is not my strong point, will consult others too. In the meantime I'll speculate. Each client has to have certificate stored locally. The problem is how to notify .NET of it's existence. AFAIK, .NET Framework, and at some level all of this functionality, relies on the X509Certificate2 class from the System.Security.X509Certificates2 namespace and you can retrieve certificates from the file system directly. To create an X509Certificate2 instance from a file, simply pass the file name to the constructor:

X509Certificate2 cert1 = new X509Certificate2("my_file_with_cert");

As far as change-logs go, SSL in c/NET is supported as of version 5.0.3 (12-31-2006). Further research shows that 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2 branches have the "encrypt" ("useSSL") connect string option enabled. However it is not available for mono (?) and compact framework projects for now:
NativeDriver.cs, ln: 245 +
#if !CF
if (connectionString.UseSSL && (serverCaps & ClientFlags.SSL) != 0)

You can check for an SSL enabled MySQL server with:

mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'have_ssl';

If you see 'YES' there, then SSL is ready to go. If you see 'DISABLED', then SSL is still available but has not been configured with the appropriate certificate and key settings. Please see:

<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/secure-using-ssl.html>
<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/ssl-options.html>

Also, this is a useful reference: <http://downloads.mysql.com/docs/connector-net-en.a4.pdf>.

Also, add the certificate to the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" management console and try again.

Making any sense?
```

[13 Aug 2008 16:53]
Wes Henderson
```
Let me be more clear.  I have no problem creating an SSL connection.  It works fine for me.  However, I have discovered a technical error with how the connection gets created.  This problem creates a security risk.

An important feature of SSL is to have the client approve the server's certificate.  For example, if the server's certificate is bad (expired, fake, etc.) we do not want to approve the certificate.  However, in Connector/Net, the client will approve any certificate, including bad certificates.  There is no validation happening.

Do you understand my concern?
```

[13 Aug 2008 17:04]
Tonci Grgin
```
Wes, yes I do... Additional text is for sake of completeness.

I have already discussed this problem with devs but I fear there will be none around in next few days to check more thoroughly on this. Please be patient and, as I said, we met this problem before.
```

[1 Sep 2008 16:31]
Tonci Grgin
```
Hi Wes and sorry for the delay. Verified as described by looking into latest sources, ServerCheckValidation never occurs.
```

[1 Oct 2008 22:24]
Wes Henderson
```
It has been 30 days since the last comment.  What is the schedule to fix this?
```

[2 Oct 2008 4:39]
Tonci Grgin
```
Wes, there are no mid-term plans to fix this but I'll ping c/NET team again.
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
