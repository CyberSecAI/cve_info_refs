Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4804:

**Verification:**
The provided content from typo3.org directly references "TYPO3-SA-2009-003", which is a security advisory for multiple vulnerabilities in TYPO3 third party extensions. While this isn't a direct match to CVE-2009-4804, the vulnerabilities described are likely candidates for this CVE (based on date and nature of the vulnerabilities).  Given that the CVE description is a placeholder, I will assume that the vulnerabilities described are indeed related to this CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerabilities stem from insecure coding practices within third-party TYPO3 extensions, specifically lacking proper input sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Present in "Accessibility Glossary" (a21glossary) and "Flat Manager" (flatmgr) extensions. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious code into input fields, potentially compromising the database.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Present in "Calendar Base" (cal) extension. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:**
        *   Data breach: Attackers could access sensitive information stored in the database.
        *   Data manipulation: Attackers could modify or delete data.
        *   Privilege escalation: Attackers could gain administrative access to the application.
    *   **XSS:**
        *   Session hijacking: Attackers could steal user session cookies, impersonating the user.
        *   Phishing: Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites or display fake login forms.
        *   Malware injection: Attackers could inject malware into the user's browser.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
   *  **SQL Injection:** By injecting malicious SQL code via the affected extensions.
   * **XSS:** By injecting malicious scripts into the affected extension.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable extensions, likely through a web browser interface.

**Specifics per Extension:**

*   **Accessibility Glossary (a21glossary):**
    *   Affected versions: 0.4.10 and below
    *   Vulnerability: SQL Injection (High Severity)
    *   Solution: Uninstall the extension, as no security update is currently available.
*   **Calendar Base (cal):**
    *   Affected versions: 1.1.0 and below
    *   Vulnerability: XSS (Medium Severity)
    *   Solution: Upgrade to version 1.1.1 or later
*  **Flat Manager (flatmgr):**
    *   Affected versions: 1.9.15 and below
    *   Vulnerability: SQL Injection (High Severity)
    *   Solution: Upgrade to version 1.9.16 or later (1.9.18 is the most recent version).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that these are third-party extensions and not part of the TYPO3 core installation.
*   The advisory refers to "Collective Security Bulletins" (CSBs), which is a method of grouping vulnerabilities in less critical extensions.
