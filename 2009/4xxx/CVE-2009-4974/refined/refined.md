Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-4974:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection (bSQL):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The `selectedCal` parameter in `rss.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Weakness:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `selectedCal` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete database information, bypass authentication, or potentially gain further access to the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  A specially crafted HTTP GET request to `rss.php` with a malicious `selectedCal` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `box` parameter in `box_display.php` is vulnerable to local file inclusion.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation or sanitization on the `box` parameter, allowing the attacker to specify a file path to be included.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially exposing sensitive information, application source code, or configuration files.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted HTTP GET request to `box_display.php` with a malicious `box` parameter containing a file path using directory traversal.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
