Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4791:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **Blind SQL Injection** flaw in the `isLoggedIn` function within the `inc/util_inc.php` file of Family Connection version 1.8.2 and earlier.
*   The `isLoggedIn` function directly incorporates user-supplied input from cookies (`fcms_login_id`, `fcms_login_uname`, `fcms_login_pw`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the `fcms_login_id` cookie to manipulate database queries. The vulnerability is "blind" because the application does not directly output the result of the injected query. Instead, the attacker must infer the results by observing application behavior.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate and sanitize the values obtained from the cookies before using them in SQL queries, allowing for malicious code injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:**  Attackers can bypass the authentication mechanism by crafting malicious SQL injection payloads in the `fcms_login_id` cookie, enabling them to log in without valid credentials.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the blind SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can write PHP code to a file on the server and achieve Remote Command Execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `fcms_login_id`, `fcms_login_uname` and `fcms_login_pw` cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with modified cookies to the vulnerable web server.

**More Detail than CVE Description:**

*   The provided content gives much more detail than a typical CVE description. It includes:
    *   Specific vulnerable code snippets.
    *   Detailed explanation of how to exploit the vulnerability using a crafted SQL injection payload within a cookie.
    *   A proof-of-concept exploit written in C that demonstrates how to create a file with PHP code to achieve remote command execution.
    *   Information about the affected application (`Family Connection`) and the affected version(s) (<= 1.8.2).
    *   The specific file path affected (`inc/util_inc.php`).
    *   The specific vulnerable function (`isLoggedIn`).
    *   The lack of a provided fix.
