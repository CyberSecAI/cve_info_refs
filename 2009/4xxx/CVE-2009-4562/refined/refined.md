      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue.",

      "attack_vectors": [
         "The attacker crafts a malicious link or webpage that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, submits a form to change the password without the administrator's knowledge."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious link or page.",
        "additional_info": "This exploit requires the admin to already be logged in."

        "attack_vectors": [
          "The attacker crafts a malicious link that includes JavaScript code in the 'from' parameter which is then executed by the victim."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince an admin to click on the crafted link. This only works if the admin is not already logged in."
