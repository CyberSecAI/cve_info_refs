Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4726:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `download.php` file of QuickDev 4. The script directly uses user-supplied input (`$_REQUEST['file']`) without proper sanitization or validation to construct a file path. This allows an attacker to manipulate the path and access files outside of the intended web directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation on the `file` parameter.
- **Path Traversal:** Attackers can use ".." sequences within the `file` parameter to navigate to parent directories and access sensitive files outside the webroot.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The code directly concatenates user input with the document root, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, and sensitive data. This could expose passwords, database credentials, and other confidential information.
- **Complete System Compromise (Potentially):** If an attacker is able to access sensitive system files, such as boot.ini on windows (as shown in the PoC), they could potentially gain a deeper understanding of the system. This can expose even more information, and perhaps contribute to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to `download.php`, providing a crafted `file` parameter value containing path traversal sequences. For example: `http://127.0.0.1/download.php?file=../../../../../../boot.ini`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable QuickDev 4 application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP requests and manipulate query parameters.
- **No Authentication:**  The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.
