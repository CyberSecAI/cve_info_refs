Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-4029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a race condition in how Automake's `make dist` and `make distcheck` targets created distribution directories.
- Before the fix, the `distdir` target would first create a directory, populate it with files to be distributed, and *then* change the permissions of all directories within to 777. This created a window where a malicious user could potentially modify files before the tarball was created.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Race Condition:** The primary vulnerability is a race condition that allowed modification of files during the distribution creation process.
- **Insecure Permissions:** Setting directory permissions to 777 (world-writable) created the opportunity for unauthorized modification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If a malicious user modified critical files like the `configure` script within the distribution directory before the tarball was created, it could lead to arbitrary code execution when `make distcheck` was run by the developer.
- **Compromised Distributions:** The security flaw could allow attackers to insert malicious code into a software distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to a system where a vulnerable package is being built. This implies a multi-user system where the build tree is world-searchable.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to exploit the timing window between the creation of the distribution directory and the creation of the tarball.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker must be a user on the same system as the developer who is building the software.
- **World-searchable Build Directory:** The top-level build directory has to be world-searchable for the attacker to gain access to the distribution directory during its creation process.
- **Timing Expertise**: The attacker must be able to race the vulnerable code in the build process to insert malicious files.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Targets:** The vulnerability was present in the `dist` and `distcheck` targets of packages using Automake.
- **Fix:** The fix involved changing the directory permissions to 755 (read and execute for all, write for the owner) *before* populating the directory during the `distdir` creation, effectively closing the timing window and preventing unauthorized modification.
- **Workaround:** Removing the searchability (x-bit) from the top-level build directory for other users (`chmod go-x .`) was an effective workaround until the official fix was applied.
- **Impact on Other Packages:**  This vulnerability affected all packages that used Automake, necessitating the regeneration of `Makefile.in` files with the fixed version of Automake.
- **Versions Affected:** The vulnerability affected Automake versions before 1.11.1 and 1.10.3.  Patches were also applied to older branches (1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, 1-8 and 1-9).
- **Reason for original permissive mode:**  The permissive mode (777) was originally implemented to cater to old `tar` programs that would fail to extract tarballs for unprivileged users.
