  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities were present in the `MSGFunctionDemarshall` function within `winscard_svc.c` of the PC/SC Smart Card daemon (PCSCD). These flaws occur due to improper sanitization of message data during demarshalling from a client.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Local, authenticated users could exploit these vulnerabilities to escalate their privileges to root. A denial of service (daemon crash) could also occur by triggering a buffer over-read.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local, authenticated users sending specially-crafted messages to the PC/SC Smart Card daemon.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be a local user on the system with the ability to communicate with the PC/SC Smart Card daemon (PCSCD)."
