```
Root cause of vulnerability:
Insecure permissions on the BASES folder in multiple Kaspersky Lab antivirus products. The "Everyone" group has "Full Control" rights to this folder, which contains antivirus bases, configuration files, and executable modules.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure file permissions
- Local privilege escalation

Impact of exploitation:
A local, unprivileged attacker can replace legitimate files within the BASES folder with malicious ones, leading to arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.

Attack vectors:
- Local access
- File replacement

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Valid logon credentials to a system with a vulnerable Kaspersky product installed.
- Ability to write to the BASES folder.
