```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Golden FTP server does not properly validate user-supplied paths, allowing directory traversal.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Directory traversal.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, outside the designated FTP root directory.
- Attack vectors: Sending a crafted "DELETE" command with directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../") through an FTP client.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to connect to the FTP server and authenticate. Anonymous login is possible in this specific exploit.
