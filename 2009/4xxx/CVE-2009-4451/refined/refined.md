Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4451:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an arbitrary file upload flaw in the "kandalf upper 0.1" application. This indicates that the application does not properly validate or sanitize uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload files of their choice to the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper controls on the file upload mechanism. The application fails to verify file types, sizes, or contents, thus enabling the upload of malicious files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious file (like a PHP web shell), an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, including access to sensitive data, modification of files, and further attacks on other systems.
*   **Complete Server Compromise:** If a web shell is uploaded, an attacker can use it to gain command-line access and further escalate their privileges, thus taking full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP File Upload:** The attack vector is through the HTTP protocol by using the application's file upload functionality. The attacker crafts a malicious file and sends it to the server using a POST request to the `fileup` directory within the kandalf application's directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker should be able to craft and send HTTP requests to upload files to the server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Application:**  The attacker needs to know the vulnerable application (`kandalf upper 0.1`) and the location of the file upload functionality. Specifically, they need to know that the upload path is `/kandalf/fileup/`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit information states that the application was tested on Windows SP2 and Linux, indicating a cross-platform vulnerability.
*   The exploit details the exact location of the file upload functionality within the vulnerable application, namely, under `/kandalf/fileup/`.

In summary, CVE-2009-4451 is a critical vulnerability due to the ability to upload arbitrary files leading to potential remote code execution, and ultimately the complete compromise of the affected server.
