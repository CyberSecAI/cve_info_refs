Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4628:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `exploit-db.com` and `evilc0de.blogspot.com` directly mentions "CVE-2009-4628" and "TPDugg Joomla Component 1.1 Blind SQL Injection Exploit," confirming its relevance. The exploit code provided is also directly related to this vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a **blind SQL injection vulnerability** in the `com_tpdugg` Joomla component, specifically version 1.1.
- The vulnerability lies in the way the component handles user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the URL when the `task=tags` is used.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker cannot directly see the output of their injected SQL queries in the response. Instead, they need to infer the results based on the application's behavior (e.g., if a page loads or not, or specific error messages).
- **Unsanitized Input:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code.
- **Vulnerable Component:** The specific component `com_tpdugg` is the vulnerable entry point in the Joomla application.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Disclosure:** The most significant impact is the ability to extract sensitive information from the database by crafting specific SQL queries to leak data from database tables like user information. In the exploit code provided, it targets the `jos_users` table to retrieve user information such as usernames and passwords.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** With the leaked information (e.g., admin credentials) or the ability to manipulate the database, an attacker could potentially gain full control over the web application or the server itself.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests with a crafted `id` parameter in the URL.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker directly manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Specific Component and Task:** The exploit targets the `com_tpdugg` component and `task=tags`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL and blind SQL injection techniques to effectively exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Target Application:** Basic understanding of the target Joomla application's structure is helpful to target specific database tables.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   The exploit code provided uses a Perl script to automate the extraction of data using the blind SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The exploit code works by sending a series of HTTP requests, each time trying a different character, using the `ASCII(SUBSTRING(...))` function to extract database content character by character.
*   The exploit targets the `jos_users` table, which is a common table for storing user credentials in Joomla applications.

In summary, the vulnerability is a blind SQL injection present in the `com_tpdugg` component of a Joomla application. Successful exploitation can lead to sensitive information disclosure. The attacker uses specifically crafted GET requests to extract data from the database.
