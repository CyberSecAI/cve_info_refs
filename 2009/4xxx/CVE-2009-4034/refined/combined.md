# E.4. Release 7.4.27

> **Release date:** 2009-12-14

This release contains a variety of fixes from 7.4.26. For
information about new features in the 7.4 major release, see
[Section E.31](release-7-4.html).

## E.4.1. Migration to Version 7.4.27

A dump/restore is not required for those running 7.4.X.
However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than
7.4.26, see the release notes for 7.4.26.

## E.4.2. Changes

* Protect against indirect security threats caused by
  index functions changing session-local state (Gurjeet
  Singh, Tom)

  This change prevents allegedly-immutable index functions
  from possibly subverting a superuser's session
  (CVE-2009-4136).
* Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte
  in the common name (CN) field (Magnus)

  This prevents unintended matching of a certificate to a
  server or client name during SSL validation
  (CVE-2009-4034).
* Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache
  initialization (Tom)
* Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times (Alvaro)

  This fix prevents a PANIC if a VACUUM FULL is cancelled after it's already
  committed its tuple movements, as well as transient errors
  if a plain VACUUM is interrupted
  after having truncated the table.
* Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table
  size calculation (Tom)

  This could occur with extremely large planner estimates
  for the size of a hashjoin's result.
* Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons
  (Chris Mikkelson)
* Fix PAM password processing to be more robust (Tom)

  The previous code is known to fail with the combination
  of the Linux pam\_krb5 PAM module
  with Microsoft Active Directory as the domain controller.
  It might have problems elsewhere too, since it was making
  unjustified assumptions about what arguments the PAM stack
  would pass to it.
* Make the postmaster ignore any application\_name parameter in connection
  request packets, to improve compatibility with future libpq
  versions (Tom)

# E.15. Release 8.3.9

> **Release Date:** 2009-12-14

This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.3.8. For
information about new features in the 8.3 major release, see
[Section E.24](release-8-3.html).

## E.15.1. Migration to Version 8.3.9

A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.3.X.
However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than
8.3.8, see the release notes for 8.3.8.

## E.15.2. Changes

* Protect against indirect security threats caused by
  index functions changing session-local state (Gurjeet
  Singh, Tom)

  This change prevents allegedly-immutable index functions
  from possibly subverting a superuser's session
  (CVE-2009-4136).
* Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte
  in the common name (CN) field (Magnus)

  This prevents unintended matching of a certificate to a
  server or client name during SSL validation
  (CVE-2009-4034).
* Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache
  initialization (Tom)
* Avoid crash on empty thesaurus dictionary (Tom)
* Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times (Alvaro)

  This fix prevents a PANIC if a VACUUM FULL is canceled after it's already
  committed its tuple movements, as well as transient errors
  if a plain VACUUM is interrupted
  after having truncated the table.
* Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table
  size calculation (Tom)

  This could occur with extremely large planner estimates
  for the size of a hashjoin's result.
* Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons
  (Chris Mikkelson)
* Ensure that shared tuple-level locks held by prepared
  transactions are not ignored (Heikki)
* Fix premature drop of temporary files used for a cursor
  that is accessed within a subtransaction (Heikki)
* Fix memory leak in syslogger process when rotating to a
  new CSV logfile (Tom)
* Fix Windows permission-downgrade logic (Jesse
  Morris)

  This fixes some cases where the database failed to start
  on Windows, often with misleading error messages such as
  "could not locate matching postgres
  executable".
* Fix incorrect logic for GiST index page splits, when the
  split depends on a non-first column of the index (Paul
  Ramsey)
* Don't error out if recycling or removing an old WAL file
  fails at the end of checkpoint (Heikki)

  It's better to treat the problem as non-fatal and allow
  the checkpoint to complete. Future checkpoints will retry
  the removal. Such problems are not expected in normal
  operation, but have been seen to be caused by misdesigned
  Windows anti-virus and backup software.
* Ensure WAL files aren't repeatedly archived on Windows
  (Heikki)

  This is another symptom that could happen if some other
  process interfered with deletion of a no-longer-needed
  file.
* Fix PAM password processing to be more robust (Tom)

  The previous code is known to fail with the combination
  of the Linux pam\_krb5 PAM module
  with Microsoft Active Directory as the domain controller.
  It might have problems elsewhere too, since it was making
  unjustified assumptions about what arguments the PAM stack
  would pass to it.
* Raise the maximum authentication token (Kerberos ticket)
  size in GSSAPI and SSPI authentication methods (Ian
  Turner)

  While the old 2000-byte limit was more than enough for
  Unix Kerberos implementations, tickets issued by Windows
  Domain Controllers can be much larger.
* Re-enable collection of access statistics for sequences
  (Akira Kurosawa)

  This used to work but was broken in 8.3.
* Fix processing of ownership dependencies during
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
  (Tom)
* Fix incorrect handling of WHERE
  x=x conditions (Tom)

  In some cases these could get ignored as redundant, but
  they aren't — they're equivalent to x IS NOT
  NULL.
* Make text search parser accept underscores in XML
  attributes (Peter)
* Fix encoding handling in xml
  binary input (Heikki)

  If the XML header doesn't specify an encoding, we now
  assume UTF-8 by default; the previous handling was
  inconsistent.
* Fix bug with calling plperl
  from plperlu or vice versa
  (Tom)

  An error exit from the inner function could result in
  crashes due to failure to re-select the correct Perl
  interpreter for the outer function.
* Fix session-lifespan memory leak when a PL/Perl function
  is redefined (Tom)
* Ensure that Perl arrays are properly converted to
  PostgreSQL arrays when
  returned by a set-returning PL/Perl function (Andrew
  Dunstan, Abhijit Menon-Sen)

  This worked correctly already for non-set-returning
  functions.
* Fix rare crash in exception processing in PL/Python
  (Peter)
* In contrib/pg\_standby, disable
  triggering failover with a signal on Windows (Fujii
  Masao)

  This never did anything useful, because Windows doesn't
  have Unix-style signals, but recent changes made it
  actually crash.
* Ensure psql's flex
  module is compiled with the correct system header
  definitions (Tom)

  This fixes build failures on platforms where --enable-largefile causes incompatible
  changes in the generated code.
* Make the postmaster ignore any application\_name parameter in connection
  request packets, to improve compatibility with future libpq
  versions (Tom)
* Update the timezone abbreviation files to match current
  reality (Joachim Wieland)

  This includes adding IDT and
  SGT to the default timezone
  abbreviation set.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009s for DST law
  changes in Antarctica, Argentina, Bangladesh, Fiji,
  Novokuznetsk, Pakistan, Palestine, Samoa, Syria; also
  historical corrections for Hong Kong.

# E.9. Release 8.2.15

> **Release Date:** 2009-12-14

This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.2.14. For
information about new features in the 8.2 major release, see
[Section E.24](release-8-2.html).

## E.9.1. Migration to Version 8.2.15

A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.2.X.
However, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than
8.2.14, see the release notes for 8.2.14.

## E.9.2. Changes

* Protect against indirect security threats caused by
  index functions changing session-local state (Gurjeet
  Singh, Tom)

  This change prevents allegedly-immutable index functions
  from possibly subverting a superuser's session
  (CVE-2009-4136).
* Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte
  in the common name (CN) field (Magnus)

  This prevents unintended matching of a certificate to a
  server or client name during SSL validation
  (CVE-2009-4034).
* Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache
  initialization (Tom)
* Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times (Alvaro)

  This fix prevents a PANIC if a VACUUM FULL is canceled after it's already
  committed its tuple movements, as well as transient errors
  if a plain VACUUM is interrupted
  after having truncated the table.
* Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table
  size calculation (Tom)

  This could occur with extremely large planner estimates
  for the size of a hashjoin's result.
* Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons
  (Chris Mikkelson)
* Ensure that shared tuple-level locks held by prepared
  transactions are not ignored (Heikki)
* Fix premature drop of temporary files used for a cursor
  that is accessed within a subtransaction (Heikki)
* Fix incorrect logic for GiST index page splits, when the
  split depends on a non-first column of the index (Paul
  Ramsey)
* Don't error out if recycling or removing an old WAL file
  fails at the end of checkpoint (Heikki)

  It's better to treat the problem as non-fatal and allow
  the checkpoint to complete. Future checkpoints will retry
  the removal. Such problems are not expected in normal
  operation, but have been seen to be caused by misdesigned
  Windows anti-virus and backup software.
* Ensure WAL files aren't repeatedly archived on Windows
  (Heikki)

  This is another symptom that could happen if some other
  process interfered with deletion of a no-longer-needed
  file.
* Fix PAM password processing to be more robust (Tom)

  The previous code is known to fail with the combination
  of the Linux pam\_krb5 PAM module
  with Microsoft Active Directory as the domain controller.
  It might have problems elsewhere too, since it was making
  unjustified assumptions about what arguments the PAM stack
  would pass to it.
* Fix processing of ownership dependencies during
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
  (Tom)
* Fix bug with calling plperl
  from plperlu or vice versa
  (Tom)

  An error exit from the inner function could result in
  crashes due to failure to re-select the correct Perl
  interpreter for the outer function.
* Fix session-lifespan memory leak when a PL/Perl function
  is redefined (Tom)
* Ensure that Perl arrays are properly converted to
  PostgreSQL arrays when
  returned by a set-returning PL/Perl function (Andrew
  Dunstan, Abhijit Menon-Sen)

  This worked correctly already for non-set-returning
  functions.
* Fix rare crash in exception processing in PL/Python
  (Peter)
* Ensure psql's flex
  module is compiled with the correct system header
  definitions (Tom)

  This fixes build failures on platforms where --enable-largefile causes incompatible
  changes in the generated code.
* Make the postmaster ignore any application\_name parameter in connection
  request packets, to improve compatibility with future libpq
  versions (Tom)
* Update the timezone abbreviation files to match current
  reality (Joachim Wieland)

  This includes adding IDT and
  SGT to the default timezone
  abbreviation set.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009s for DST law
  changes in Antarctica, Argentina, Bangladesh, Fiji,
  Novokuznetsk, Pakistan, Palestine, Samoa, Syria; also
  historical corrections for Hong Kong.

# E.21. Release 8.4.2

> **Release Date:** 2009-12-14

This release contains a variety of fixes from 8.4.1. For
information about new features in the 8.4 major release, see
[Section E.23](release-8-4.html).

## E.21.1. Migration to Version 8.4.2

A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.4.X.
However, if you have any hash indexes, you should REINDEX them after updating to 8.4.2, to repair
possible damage.

## E.21.2. Changes

* Protect against indirect security threats caused by
  index functions changing session-local state (Gurjeet
  Singh, Tom)

  This change prevents allegedly-immutable index functions
  from possibly subverting a superuser's session
  (CVE-2009-4136).
* Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte
  in the common name (CN) field (Magnus)

  This prevents unintended matching of a certificate to a
  server or client name during SSL validation
  (CVE-2009-4034).
* Fix hash index corruption (Tom)

  The 8.4 change that made hash indexes keep entries
  sorted by hash value failed to update the bucket splitting
  and compaction routines to preserve the ordering. So
  application of either of those operations could lead to
  permanent corruption of an index, in the sense that
  searches might fail to find entries that are present. To
  deal with this, it is recommended to REINDEX any hash indexes you may have after
  installing this update.
* Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache
  initialization (Tom)
* Avoid crash on empty thesaurus dictionary (Tom)
* Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times (Alvaro)

  This fix prevents a PANIC if a VACUUM FULL is canceled after it's already
  committed its tuple movements, as well as transient errors
  if a plain VACUUM is interrupted
  after having truncated the table.
* Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table
  size calculation (Tom)

  This could occur with extremely large planner estimates
  for the size of a hashjoin's result.
* Fix crash if a DROP is
  attempted on an internally-dependent object (Tom)
* Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons
  (Chris Mikkelson)
* Ensure that shared tuple-level locks held by prepared
  transactions are not ignored (Heikki)
* Fix premature drop of temporary files used for a cursor
  that is accessed within a subtransaction (Heikki)
* Fix memory leak in syslogger process when rotating to a
  new CSV logfile (Tom)
* Fix memory leak in postmaster when re-parsing pg\_hba.conf (Tom)
* Fix Windows permission-downgrade logic (Jesse
  Morris)

  This fixes some cases where the database failed to start
  on Windows, often with misleading error messages such as
  "could not locate matching postgres
  executable".
* Make FOR UPDATE/SHARE in the
  primary query not propagate into WITH queries (Tom)

  For example, in

  ```

  WITH w AS (SELECT * FROM foo) SELECT * FROM w, bar ... FOR UPDATE

  ```

  the FOR UPDATE will now affect
  bar but not foo. This is more useful and consistent than
  the original 8.4 behavior, which tried to propagate
  FOR UPDATE into the WITH query but always failed due to assorted
  implementation restrictions. It also follows the design
  rule that WITH queries are
  executed as if independent of the main query.
* Fix bug with a WITH RECURSIVE
  query immediately inside another one (Tom)
* Fix concurrency bug in hash indexes (Tom)

  Concurrent insertions could cause index scans to
  transiently report wrong results.
* Fix incorrect logic for GiST index page splits, when the
  split depends on a non-first column of the index (Paul
  Ramsey)
* Fix wrong search results for a multi-column GIN index
  with fastupdate enabled
  (Teodor)
* Fix bugs in WAL entry creation for GIN indexes (Tom)

  These bugs were masked when full\_page\_writes was on, but with it off a
  WAL replay failure was certain if a crash occurred before
  the next checkpoint.
* Don't error out if recycling or removing an old WAL file
  fails at the end of checkpoint (Heikki)

  It's better to treat the problem as non-fatal and allow
  the checkpoint to complete. Future checkpoints will retry
  the removal. Such problems are not expected in normal
  operation, but have been seen to be caused by misdesigned
  Windows anti-virus and backup software.
* Ensure WAL files aren't repeatedly archived on Windows
  (Heikki)

  This is another symptom that could happen if some other
  process interfered with deletion of a no-longer-needed
  file.
* Fix PAM password processing to be more robust (Tom)

  The previous code is known to fail with the combination
  of the Linux pam\_krb5 PAM module
  with Microsoft Active Directory as the domain controller.
  It might have problems elsewhere too, since it was making
  unjustified assumptions about what arguments the PAM stack
  would pass to it.
* Raise the maximum authentication token (Kerberos ticket)
  size in GSSAPI and SSPI authentication methods (Ian
  Turner)

  While the old 2000-byte limit was more than enough for
  Unix Kerberos implementations, tickets issued by Windows
  Domain Controllers can be much larger.
* Ensure that domain constraints are enforced in
  constructs like ARRAY[...]::domain, where the domain is over
  an array type (Heikki)
* Fix foreign-key logic for some cases involving
  composite-type columns as foreign keys (Tom)
* Ensure that a cursor's snapshot is not modified after it
  is created (Alvaro)

  This could lead to a cursor delivering wrong results if
  later operations in the same transaction modify the data
  the cursor is supposed to return.
* Fix CREATE TABLE to properly
  merge default expressions coming from different inheritance
  parent tables (Tom)

  This used to work but was broken in 8.4.
* Re-enable collection of access statistics for sequences
  (Akira Kurosawa)

  This used to work but was broken in 8.3.
* Fix processing of ownership dependencies during
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
  (Tom)
* Fix incorrect handling of WHERE
  x=x conditions (Tom)

  In some cases these could get ignored as redundant, but
  they aren't — they're equivalent to x IS NOT
  NULL.
* Fix incorrect plan construction when using hash
  aggregation to implement DISTINCT
  for textually identical volatile expressions (Tom)
* Fix Assert failure for a volatile SELECT DISTINCT ON expression (Tom)
* Fix `ts_stat()` to not fail
  on an empty tsvector value (Tom)
* Make text search parser accept underscores in XML
  attributes (Peter)
* Fix encoding handling in xml
  binary input (Heikki)

  If the XML header doesn't specify an encoding, we now
  assume UTF-8 by default; the previous handling was
  inconsistent.
* Fix bug with calling plperl
  from plperlu or vice versa
  (Tom)

  An error exit from the inner function could result in
  crashes due to failure to re-select the correct Perl
  interpreter for the outer function.
* Fix session-lifespan memory leak when a PL/Perl function
  is redefined (Tom)
* Ensure that Perl arrays are properly converted to
  PostgreSQL arrays when
  returned by a set-returning PL/Perl function (Andrew
  Dunstan, Abhijit Menon-Sen)

  This worked correctly already for non-set-returning
  functions.
* Fix rare crash in exception processing in PL/Python
  (Peter)
* Fix ecpg problem with
  comments in DECLARE CURSOR
  statements (Michael)
* Fix ecpg to not treat
  recently-added keywords as reserved words (Tom)

  This affected the keywords CALLED, CATALOG,
  DEFINER, ENUM, FOLLOWING,
  INVOKER, OPTIONS, PARTITION,
  PRECEDING, RANGE, SECURITY,
  SERVER, UNBOUNDED, and WRAPPER.
* Re-allow regular expression special characters in
  psql's \df function name parameter (Tom)
* In contrib/fuzzystrmatch,
  correct the calculation of `levenshtein` distances with non-default
  costs (Marcin Mank)
* In contrib/pg\_standby, disable
  triggering failover with a signal on Windows (Fujii
  Masao)

  This never did anything useful, because Windows doesn't
  have Unix-style signals, but recent changes made it
  actually crash.
* Put FREEZE and VERBOSE options in the right order in the
  VACUUM command that contrib/vacuumdb produces (Heikki)
* Fix possible leak of connections when contrib/dblink encounters an error
  (Tatsuhito Kasahara)
* Ensure psql's flex
  module is compiled with the correct system header
  definitions (Tom)

  This fixes build failures on platforms where --enable-largefile causes incompatible
  changes in the generated code.
* Make the postmaster ignore any application\_name parameter in connection
  request packets, to improve compatibility with future libpq
  versions (Tom)
* Update the timezone abbreviation files to match current
  reality (Joachim Wieland)

  This includes adding IDT to the
  default timezone abbreviation set.
* Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2009s for DST law
  changes in Antarctica, Argentina, Bangladesh, Fiji,
  Novokuznetsk, Pakistan, Palestine, Samoa, Syria; also
  historical corrections for Hong Kong.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- expat
The previous expat security update (CVE-2009-3560) caused parse
errors with some xml documents.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0-11.2
- postfix
The post install script of postfix accidentally let postfix listen
on all network interfaces (CVE-2010-0230).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3
- phpMyAdmin
The use of unserialize() on POST data which could have lead to
remote code execution (CVE-2009-4605) has been fixed as well as some
minor temporary file issues (CVE-2008-7251, CVE-2008-7252).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- postgresql
An unprivileged, authenticated PostgreSQL user could create a table
which references functions with malicious content. Maintenance
operations carried out be the database superuser could execute such
functions (CVE-2009-4136).
Embedded null bytes in the common name of SSL certificates could
bypass certificate hostname checks (CVE-2009-4034).
postgresql was updated to the next upstream patchlevel update which
also includes several bugfixes. See the package changelog for
details.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0-11.2
- dovecot12
Dovecot created the configured 'base\_dir' (/var/run/dovecot) with
mode 0777 if it didn't exist, therefore allowing local users to mess
with e.g. the authentication socket (CVE-2009-3897).
Note that /var/run/dovecot is part of the dovecot rpm with proper
permission settings. Therefor dovecot is not vulnerable in the
default configuration as shipped on openSUSE.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- msmtp
msmtp did not properly handle a '\0' character in the domain name of
SSL certificates (CVE-2009-3942).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0-11.2

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.
