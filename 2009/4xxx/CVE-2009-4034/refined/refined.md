Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2009-4034:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way PostgreSQL handles SSL certificates. Specifically, it fails to properly reject certificates containing embedded null bytes within the Common Name (CN) field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation: The system does not check for and reject null bytes in the CN field of SSL certificates during the validation process.
- Vulnerable SSL certificate handling: The improper handling of null bytes in the CN allows for unintended matching of certificates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks: An attacker can forge or manipulate SSL certificates to trick a server or client into accepting a malicious certificate. This allows the attacker to intercept, read, and potentially modify encrypted communications.
- Spoofing/Impersonation: By crafting an SSL certificate with a null byte, an attacker can potentially impersonate a legitimate server or client, misleading users and other systems.
- Bypassing authentication: The vulnerability in certificate validation could allow an attacker to bypass intended authentication mechanisms.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack can be performed over a network by presenting a malicious SSL certificate during an SSL handshake.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to present their forged SSL certificate, typically during the SSL/TLS handshake between the client and the server

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create/forge SSL certificates: The attacker must be capable of generating or modifying SSL certificates to include a null byte in the CN field.
- Network access: The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to intercept or initiate communication with the vulnerable server/client.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in PostgreSQL versions 7.4.27, 8.0.23, 8.1.19, 8.2.15, 8.3.9 and 8.4.2
- Several sources confirm this fix, and the description is consistent across different sources.
- The vulnerability is listed in HP Security Bulletin HPSBMU02781 as impacting HP Network Node Manager i (NNMi) which uses PostgreSQL.
- SUSE Security Summary Report also mentions this CVE and its fix in PostgreSQL.
