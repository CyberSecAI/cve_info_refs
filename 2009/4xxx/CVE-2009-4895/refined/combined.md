Steve,

Can you give this a 2009 ID. Perhaps I could use a group of 2009 IDs, as there
have been quite a few old requests this week.

Thanks.

Also see, <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=559100>.

If memory serves me well, it should affect kernels v2.6.21-rc1 onwards
with the commit ab521dc0.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14605#c0)  Kyle Bader    2009-11-14 22:23:29 UTC  ``` I personally am not a kernel programmer however when I showed the attached trace to Brad Spengler he suggested I file a report, he also had this to say:  "read_buf needs to be properly synchronized -- right now, only read_head is synchronized with a spinlock.  What's happening here is that spinlock is getting held and released in n_tty_flush_buffer() from n_tty_close(), then the read happens (getting past the NULL check, as read_buf hasn't been NULLed yet, though could be in the process of being freed at this point).  Then read_buf gets set to NULL and the tty->read_buf[tty_read_head] = c executes, causing the NULL deref."  I added Joe Peterson as a cc because he was listed by get_maintainer.pl alongside Alan Cox, who to my understanding is not working on tty anymore.    kernel version:   2.6.31.5 from git e2984cbfddd5c8fac88b24d7e5f28e1cfb6f3838  additional patches:   aufs2-2.6/aufs2-31 from git 122bf939bcc705083bd5a43defcd0c3249f7fe88 vserver patch-2.6.31.5-vs2.3.0.36.21.diff  I've tried to be complete however this is my first filing on the kernel bugzilla so if I forgot to include something kindly let me know and I'll get back to you. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=14605#c1)  Kyle Bader    2009-11-14 22:24:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 23786](attachment.cgi?id=23786 "raw trace from serial console buffer") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=23786&action=edit "raw trace from serial console buffer") raw trace from serial console buffer ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=14605#c2)  Kyle Bader    2009-11-14 22:24:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 23787](attachment.cgi?id=23787 "Decoded trace file") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=23787&action=edit "Decoded trace file") Decoded trace file ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=14605#c3)  Andrew Morton    2009-11-15 00:28:17 UTC  ``` hm, we don't have tty or ldisc categories in bugzilla, so I reassigned this to drivers/serial.

                 CVE-2010-3015
Debian Bug(s)  : 589179

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-4895

    Kyle Bader reported an issue in the tty subsystem that allows local
    users to create a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference).

CVE-2010-2226

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the xfs filesystem that allows local
    users to copy and read a file owned by another user, for which they
    only have write permissions, due to a lack of permission checking in the
    XFS_SWAPEXT ioctl.

CVE-2010-2240

    Rafal Wojtczuk reported an issue that allows users to obtain escalated
    privileges. Users must already have sufficient privileges to execute or
    connect clients to an Xorg server.

CVE-2010-2248

    Suresh Jayaraman discovered an issue in the CIFS filesystem. A malicious
    file server can set an incorrect "CountHigh" value, resulting in a

local attacker could exploit this to control DNS replies, leading to a loss

of privacy and possible privilege escalation. ([CVE-2010-2524](/security/CVE-2010-2524))

Dan Rosenberg discovered a flaw in gfs2 file system's handling of acls

(access control lists). An unprivileged local attacker could exploit this

flaw to gain access or execute any file stored in the gfs2 file system.

([CVE-2010-2525](/security/CVE-2010-2525))

Bob Peterson discovered that GFS2 rename operations did not correctly

validate certain sizes. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the

system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-2798](/security/CVE-2010-2798))

Eric Dumazet discovered that many network functions could leak kernel stack

contents. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions of kernel

memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-2942](/security/CVE-2010-2942), [CVE-2010-3477](/security/CVE-2010-3477))

Subject: CVE Request - kernel: put_tty_queue NULL pointer deref

Going through some old issues, we have this one from 2009:
 <https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14605>

Upstream fix went into 2.6.33-rc8:
  <http://git.kernel.org/linus/80e1e823989ec44d8e35bdfddadbddcffec90424>

This was included in 2.6.32.9 and 2.6.27.46, but it looks like our
2.6.26-based kernel may have the issue as well.

It turns out that we really cannot hold 'tty->ctrl_lock' over calling     __f_setown, because not only did that cause problems with interrupt     disables (which the second commit fixed), it also causes a potential     ABBA deadlock due to lock ordering.          Thanks to Tetsuo Handa for following up on the issue, and running     lockdep to show the problem.  It goes roughly like this:           - f_getown gets filp->f_owner.lock for reading without interrupts        disabled, so an interrupt that happens while that lock is held can        cause a lockdep chain from f_owner.lock -> sighand->siglock.           - at the same time, the tty->ctrl_lock -> f_owner.lock chain that        commit 703625118069 introduced, together with the pre-existing        sighand->siglock -> tty->ctrl_lock chain means that we have a lock        dependency the other way too.          So instead of extending tty->ctrl_lock over the whole __f_setown() call,     we now just take a reference to the 'pid' structure while holding the     lock, and then release it after having done the __f_setown.  That still     guarantees that 'struct pid' won't go away from under us, which is all     we really ever needed.

Use CVE-2009-4895

A 2009 pool will be sent to you separately.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.
