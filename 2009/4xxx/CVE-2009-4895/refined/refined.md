Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-4895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to a race condition in the Linux kernel's TTY (teletypewriter) subsystem. Specifically, the issue arises during the closing of a TTY device. When a TTY device is closed, the `n_tty_flush_buffer()` function is called. This function might be executed concurrently with a read operation, which can lead to a NULL pointer dereference. The core problem lies in the lack of proper synchronization between the `read_buf` pointer being freed in `n_tty_flush_buffer()` and its use in the read operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition between the TTY close operation which releases a buffer (`read_buf`) and a concurrent read operation that accesses this same buffer.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  The read operation proceeds after the NULL check, but before `read_buf` is set to NULL. The subsequent access to `tty->read_buf[tty_read_head]` results in a NULL pointer dereference if the `read_buf` has been freed, but not yet NULLed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of the vulnerability is a kernel crash (NULL pointer dereference), leading to a denial of service. This means the system becomes unresponsive, requiring a reboot.
*   **Potential Information Exposure:**  While not explicitly stated as a primary impact, the crash could potentially leak some kernel memory information through the crash dump/logs generated, but this is not the primary vector of exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local user.  The attacker needs to be able to interact with a tty device.
*   **Triggering the Race:** The attacker would need to trigger the specific sequence of operations that create the race condition during TTY closing and read operations.  This could be accomplished by opening and closing a TTY device while another process attempts to read from it, possibly with some crafted input to speed up the race condition. The `pexpect` python program is reported to reliably reproduce the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the system to open and interact with TTY devices.
*   **Ability to Interact with TTY:** The attacker needs to have the ability to perform TTY operations, including closing the device, as well as triggering another process to read from the TTY.
* **No special privileges required.** An unprivileged user can trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in kernel versions 2.6.21-rc1 and onwards, introduced by commit `ab521dc0`.
*   The fix for the issue was included in kernel version 2.6.33-rc8 and backported to some older kernel versions like 2.6.32.9 and 2.6.27.46.
*   The fix addresses the issue by ensuring proper synchronization of access to the TTY buffers, preventing the race condition that causes the null pointer dereference.

**Summary of Patches (from various sources):**

*   Commit `80e1e823989ec44d8e35bdfddadbddcffec90424` fixes the race condition in `tty_fasync()` properly.
*   The fixes address the locking of `tty->pgrp` and the race condition in `tty_fasync` along with a fix in `fnctl` that ensures `f_modown` calls `write_lock_irqsave/restore`.
*   The core fix was to ensure proper locking to make sure `struct pid` did not go away during reads.

**Affected Software:**
* Linux kernel versions 2.6.21-rc1 up to (but not including) 2.6.33-rc8.
