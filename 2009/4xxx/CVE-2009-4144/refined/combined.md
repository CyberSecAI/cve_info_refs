I just assigned two CVE ids for NetworkManager:

CVE-2009-4144 Possible connections to spoofed WPA Enterprise networks without validating network certificate
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=546795>

CVE-2009-4145 Information disclosure by nm-connection-editor

Subject: network-manager-gnome: nm connects to WPA2 with certificate after .pem file
was delated
Date: Tue, 08 Dec 2009 18:40:44 +0100
```
Package: network-manager-gnome
Version: 0.7.2-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

After configuring WPA2 Enterprise with TTLS and PAP, I was using certificate file
in /etc/ssl/certs/...pem  (autmatically imported from /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/domain/certrootfile.crt)

Then i reinstalled system, and not configured certifcates yet.

After reinstalling system and restoring /home directory, i logged into my new stystem.

After giving password to gnome-keyring NM automatically connected to my network,
even cosindering that it is not existing:

** (nm-applet:6704): WARNING **: utils_fill_connection_certs: couldn't read CA certificate: 4 Nie można otworzyć pliku "/etc/ssl/certs/SMP_Root_Certification_Authority_2.pem": Nie ma takiego pliku ani katalogu

But NM thinks that it should connect anyway. And it connects,
possibly leaking my credentials, login and password, and all
keys, and of course network traffic.

It should be considerebly more verbose error provided to an user (using nm-applet),
and NM should abort connecting.

I agree it is a security issue, but imho not such a severe one that severity
grave is justified, especially as it only happens under very particular
circumstances (thus downgrading to important).

This bug is supposedly fixed in the upcoming 0.8 release. If you want to try, I
have preliminary packages at [1] and I would be interested if this packages
behave better.

Cheers,
Michael

Ok, it is anyway quite rare. And need to be trigered by deleting certificate file,
so it is quite unprobable to be a malicious vector attack.

I would be happy to check this.

I added this repositoy to sources.list.

On upgrade (or  apt-get  install network-manager-gnome network-manager),
apt-get (and aptitude) want to remove policykit. for no apparent reason.
I checked briefly and I have *pol*kit* in versions 0.9-4 or 0.95-1 or greater,
and your network-manager packages depends on libpolkit* (>= 0.7)
and recommends policykit. I don't know why aptitude wants to remove
it.

Even forcing instalation of policykit doesn't resolve problem:

Do you want to continue? [Y/n/?]
...

It still wants to remove policykit. It is nonsensical.

Mayby it is something broken in unstable, i will wait few days.

Regards.

Hi,

this issue got a CVE id:

[CVE-2009-4144](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4144)[0]:
| NetworkManager (NM) 0.7.2 does not ensure that the configured
| Certification Authority (CA) certificate file for a (1) WPA Enterprise
| or (2) 802.1x network remains present upon a connection attempt, which
| might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause
| a denial of service (connectivity disruption) by spoofing the identity
| of a wireless network.

Unfortunately the vulnerability described above is not important enough
to get it fixed via regular security update in Debian stable and oldstable. It
does not warrant a DSA.

However it would be nice if this could get fixed via a regular point update[1].
Please contact the release team for this.

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE id in your changelog entry.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2009-4144

| **Name** | CVE-2009-4144 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | NetworkManager (NM) 0.7.2 does not ensure that the configured Certification Authority (CA) certificate file for a (1) WPA Enterprise or (2) 802.1x network remains present upon a connection attempt, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (connectivity disruption) by spoofing the identity of a wireless network. |
| **Source** | [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-4144) (at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2009-4144); [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview=&query=CVE-2009-4144), [LWN](https://lwn.net/Search/DoSearch?words=CVE-2009-4144), [oss-sec](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&s=CVE-2009-4144), [fulldisc](https://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&s=CVE-2009-4144), [Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2009-4144), [Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-4144), [Gentoo](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2009-4144), SUSE [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2009-4144)/[CVE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4144/), GitHub [advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=CVE-2009-4144)/[code](https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%22CVE-2009-4144%22)/[issues](https://github.com/search?type=Issues&q=%22CVE-2009-4144%22), [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=%22CVE-2009-4144%22), [more](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors)) |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=546795#c0)  Dan Williams    2009-12-11 23:52:08 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #546793](show_bug.cgi?id=546793) +++  See also:  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=560067>  If the user had set up a WPA Enterprise or 802.1x connection that used a CA certificate to verify the identity of the network to which the user was connecting, and the user deleted or moved that CA certificate file at a later point, NetworkManager will still connect to that network but without using the CA certificate.  This could result in connections to a rogue network that is spoofing the original network as the identity of the network is not verified with the CA certificate after the certificate has been deleted.  Obviously requires direct interaction by the user that configured the connection in the first place to remove the CA certificate file.  --- Additional comment from dcbw on 2009-12-11 18:50:57 EDT ---  Upstream fix is:  <http://git.gnome.org/cgit/network-manager-applet/commit/?h=NETWORKMANAGER_APPLET_0_7&id=4020594dfbf566f1852f0acb36ad631a9e73a82b>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=546795#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-12-23 19:27:56 UTC  ``` NetworkManager-0.7.2-2.git20091223.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/NetworkManager-0.7.2-2.git20091223.fc11>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=546795#c6)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-02 21:30:22 UTC  ``` NetworkManager-0.7.2-2.git20091223.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- virtualbox-ose
This update of virtualbox-ose fixes a memory consumption bug in the
kernel code that can be used to allocate almost all physical memory
(CVE-2009-3940).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- NetworkManager-gnome
nm-applet connected to WPA2 Enterprise networks even if the specified CA
certificate file didn't exist (CVE-2009-4144).
When editing connections in nm-applet the connection object was exported via
DBus disclosing potentially sensitive information to local users
(CVE-2009-4145).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- avahi
The avahi-daemon reflector could cause packet storms when reflecting
legacy unicast mDNS traffic (CVE-2009-0758).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- acl
the getfacl tool followed symbolic links in recursive (-R) mode even
if the --physical (-P) option was specified (CVE-2009-4411).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- libthai
very long strings could lead to a heap buffer overflow in libthai
(CVE-2009-4012).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
