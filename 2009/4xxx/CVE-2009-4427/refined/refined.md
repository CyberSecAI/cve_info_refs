Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4427:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw.
- The `cmd.php` script in phpLDAPadmin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input from the `cmd` parameter in the URI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `cmd` parameter is directly used to construct a file path without any validation or sanitization.
- **Local File Inclusion:** The application includes files based on user-controlled paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the webserver has access to, including sensitive system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/issue`).
- **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive information can lead to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `cmd.php` script, using the `cmd` parameter to specify a path to a local file.
- **Path Traversal:** The attacker uses ".." sequences in the `cmd` parameter to navigate up the directory structure and access files outside of the intended web application directory.
- **Null Byte Termination:**  The exploit utilizes a null byte (`%00`) at the end of the path to truncate it and bypass potential file extension checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Knowledge of Application Path:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the path to the `cmd.php` script.
- **Basic Web Exploitation Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the required path traversal and null byte.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit information mentions that phpLDAPadmin version 1.1.0.5, as well as installations on Ubuntu 8.10 and Debian 5.0, are vulnerable. Other versions might also be affected.
- The identified vulnerable code is in `cmd.php` which uses the user provided `cmd` parameter to include files from `HOOKSDIR` or `HTDOCDIR`.
