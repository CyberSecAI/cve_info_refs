    "description": "Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in ffmpeg, a multimedia player, server and encoder, which also provides a range of multimedia libraries used in applications like MPlayer.\n\nVarious programming errors in container and codec implementations may lead to denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if the user is tricked into opening a malformed media file or stream.\n\nAffected and updated have been the implementations of the following codecs and container formats:\n\n- the Vorbis audio codec\n- the Ogg container implementation\n- the FF Video 1 codec\n- the MPEG audio codec\n- the H264 video codec\n- the MOV container implementation\n- the Oggedc container implementation",
