Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `displayposts.php` file of the Discloser application (version 0.0.4-rc2).
*   The script directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `more` GET parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `more` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL statements into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database.
*   The exploit description mentions retrieving information from fields 3, 4, 7, and 8 using a `UNION ALL SELECT` technique.
*   Potentially, an attacker could modify or delete data if they escalate privileges by injecting additional SQL statements.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote, exploiting the web interface of the Discloser application.
*   The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a malicious `more` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Discloser application.
*   No special privileges are needed; the vulnerability can be exploited by a guest user.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit details the vulnerable code snippet:
    ```php
    if (isset($_GET['more'])) {
        $more = $_GET['more'];
        $query = mysql_query("select ". $tableprefix ."posts.*, ". $tableprefix ."users.username, ". $tableprefix ."users.email from ". $tableprefix ."posts, ". $tableprefix ."users where ". $tableprefix ."posts.poster = ". $tableprefix ."users.username and ". $tableprefix ."posts.id = $more");
    ```
*   The suggested fix is to use `intval()` on the `$_GET['more']` variable to ensure that it contains only numeric data.
*   The provided exploit example is `http://www.site.com/path/index.php?more=-1 UNION ALL SELECT 1,'long',3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10`
