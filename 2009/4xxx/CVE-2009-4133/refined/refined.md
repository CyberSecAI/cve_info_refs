Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4133:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the `condor_shadow` daemon authenticates to the `condor_schedd` as the `condor` user (a super user) when performing `set_job_attr` operations on behalf of chirp calls made by a submitted job. This allows a malicious job to change its own "Owner" attribute to that of the condor user, or other users who have submitted jobs, effectively gaining the privileges of those users. This occurs because there was no proper privilege dropping mechanism for `condor_shadow`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Improper Privilege Management:**  The core issue is that `condor_shadow` is not dropping privileges correctly when executing chirp calls, allowing jobs to elevate their privileges. The `condor_shadow` authenticates as a super user and this is not reduced when interacting with the job.
-   **Insecure Attribute Modification:** Users are allowed to change the `Owner` attribute of their jobs to arbitrary other users.
-   **Authentication Bypass:** The `condor_shadow` authenticates as the `condor` user, and then the running job takes on these privileges through chirp calls without authorization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Account Compromise:** A user can gain control of other local user accounts, by changing the owner to another user who has previously submitted jobs.
-   **Job Manipulation:** Malicious jobs can modify or terminate other users' jobs in the queue.
-   **Potential System Compromise:** Although direct root access is not possible, it may be feasible to exploit other vulnerabilities by first gaining access to other non-privileged accounts.
-   **Compromise of Condor Daemons:**  Becoming the condor user allows modification of all other jobs and the Condor daemons.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Job Submission:**  The attack vector is through the submission of a malicious job to the Condor system.
-   **Chirp Calls:** The exploit leverages `chirp` calls within the job to perform `set_job_attr` operations.
-   **Owner attribute modification:** Changing the job owner to another user via the `set_job_attr` call allows the attacker to assume the identity of another user on the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Authorized User:** The attacker must have the ability to submit jobs to the Condor system. This requires local access on a machine where the user has write authorization to the `condor_schedd`.
-   **Basic Condor Knowledge:** Only basic knowledge of Condor command-line tools is required to perform the exploit.
-   **Ability to run code:** The attacker has to be able to run a job on the Condor system that executes malicious code to change the job's owner.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The vulnerability affects Condor versions 6.5.4 through 7.2.4, and 7.3.x and 7.4.0.
-  Prior to version 7.2.0, a user could change the owner attribute to the Condor admin user. As of 7.2.0 a user can change the owner to any user who has a job or has ever had a job in the queue.
-   The fix involves making privileged job attributes immutable. In later versions, a `qmgmt` command is introduced to reduce privileges to that of an ordinary user.
- A fix for the stable series makes the owner attribute immutable. A fix for the development series makes the job queue updater set its effective qmgmt owner to the user.
- The vulnerability was resolved in Condor versions 7.2.5 and 7.4.1.
- Red Hat issued security advisories RHSA-2009:1688 and RHSA-2009:1689 to address this issue.
