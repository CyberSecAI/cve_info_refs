| Summary: |  |
| --- | --- |
| An ordinary user that can submit jobs to a Condor system can modify any of the attributes of its Condor job. This in turn can be used to compromise other users' jobs, which can lead to a complete compromise of the local accounts in the Condor system other than the local privileged accounts (root on POSIX systems and local\Administrator on Windows). | |

| Access Required: | ability to submit to a Condor schedd |
| This vulnerability requires local access on a machine where the user has write authorization to the condor\_schedd (i.e., a host and account where the user can submit a job). | |
| Effort Required: | low |
| The use of ordinary condor command line tools is all that is required to exploit this vulnerability. | |
| Impact/Consequences: | high |
| This vulnerability can result in a complete compromise of the local accounts in the Condor system other than local privileged accounts (root on POSIX systems and local\Administrator on Windows). This includes control of users' jobs and the Condor daemons. | |

| [Condor Wiki Ticket #1018](https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=1018) | |
| Full Details: |  |
| As of 7.2.0, the queue super user has the power to change the value of Owner to any owner who has a job in the queue or who has ever had a job in the queue during the life of the current running schedd. This was added for JobRouter. Prior to version 7.2.0, a user could always change the value of Owner to the Condor admin user. The problem with this is that condor\_shadow authenticates to the schedd as the condor user (always a super user) when performing set\_job\_attr operations on behalf of chirp calls made by the job. Therefore, the job can change its own Owner attribute, requeue itself, and gain access to somebody else's account. It can only gain access to accounts that have submitted a job to condor or to the "condor" user. Condor prevents jobs from running as the local privileged accounts (root on POSIX systems and local\Administrator on Windows), so gaining access to the these account is not possible directly. It may be possible by submitting jobs that run as other local accounts that can then be used to gain access to the local privileged account. This example bash script below will submit a job. It will be submnitted as the local user, but after it completes it the "Owner" will be set to the Condor user. ````     #!/usr/bin/bash      # create a submission file      cat <<EOF >>test.sub     universe = vanilla     +WantIOProxy = True     executable = $ENV(CONDOR_CHIRP)     arguments = set_job_attr Owner \"$ENV(CONDOR_USER)\"     when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT     leave_in_queue = JobStatus==4     queue     EOF           # set some variables and submit the job      export CONDOR_USER=`condor_config_val schedd_log | xargs ls -l  | awk '{print $3}'`     export CONDOR_CHIRP=`condor_config_val libexec`/condor_chirp     condor_submit test.sub      ```` | |
| Cause: | not properly dropping privileges |
| Chirp connections from a running job connect to the schedd via the shadow. The shadow authenticates with the schedd as the "Condor" user (the privileged account in Condor system). The running job then assumes the privileges of the Condor user. | |
| Proposed Fix: |  |
| In all fixed versions of Condor, the privileged attributes are now immutable including the owner attribute, which will prevent this problem. Going forward, starting with version 7.5.0, Condor was further changed to add a qmgmt command that allows the queue super user to reduce privileges to that of an ordinary user so that all subsequent operations in the qmgmt session are done as though by the other user (like seteuid() in unix). The job queue updater used by the shadow (and local starter) does this in all cases immediately after establishing a qmgmt session. This addresses the problem of chirp but also reduces risk of other operations being allowed that should not be. Changing the shadow to authenticate as the user instead of condor is another possible solution. This is problematic, because not all authentication methods support authenticating as the user from within a condor daemon. For those methods that do support authentication based on priv state (such as FS), the security session cache does not keep track of what priv state was used to create the session, so we would either need to fix that, or change all shadow --> schedd communication to be done as the user (including the daemon keepalive and possibly other things I am forgetting). Removing the power of the super user to directly change Owner is another option. In fact, with the "seteuid()" qmgmt operation, the JobRouter should no longer need the queue super user to have the power to directly set Owner. However, changing the JobRouter seems like a larger than necessary change in the stable series, so this should probably be done in the current development series, leaving the extra super user power as is in the stable series if not beyond. | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=544371#c0)  Matthew Farrellee    2009-12-04 18:35:06 UTC  ``` <http://condor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=1018>  As of 7.2.0, the queue super user has the power to change the value of Owner to any owner who has a job in the queue or who has ever had a job in the queue during the life of the current running schedd. This was added for JobRouter.  The problem with this is that condor_shadow authenticates to the schedd as the condor user (always a super user) when performing set_job_attr operations on behalf of chirp calls made by the job. Therefore, the job can change its own Owner attribute, requeue itself, and gain access to somebody else's account. It can only gain access to accounts that have submitted a job to condor, and it can not gain access to root, because condor will not run jobs as root.  The solution we decided to pursue in 7.2.5 and 7.4.1 is to add a qmgmt command that allows the queue super user to reduce privileges to that of an ordinary user so that all subsequent operations in the qmgmt session are done as though by the other user (like seteuid() in unix). The job queue updater used by the shadow (and local starter) does this in all cases immediately after establishing a qmgmt session. This addresses the problem of chirp but also reduces risk of other operations being allowed that should not be.  Changing the shadow to authenticate as the user instead of condor is another possible solution. This is problematic, because not all authentication methods support authenticating as the user from within a condor daemon. For those methods that do support authentication based on priv state (such as FS), the security session cache does not keep track of what priv state was used to create the session, so we would either need to fix that, or change all shadow --> schedd communication to be done as the user (including the daemon keepalive and possibly other things I am forgetting).  Removing the power of the super user to directly change Owner is another option. In fact, with the "seteuid()" qmgmt operation, the JobRouter should no longer need the queue super user to have the power to directly set Owner. However, changing the JobRouter seems like a larger than necessary change in the stable series, so this should probably be done in the current development series, leaving the extra super user power as is in the stable series if not beyond.  2009-Dec-03 10:18:58 by danb: The problem is slightly worse than we previously thought. Even before 7.2.0 chirp can set the owner to the condor user. This is possible because in all existing versions of condor, any user is allowed to set Owner to the authenticated name of the qmgmt connection, and the shadow authenticates as the condor user.  So in all versions of condor that support chirp's set attribute operation (appears to be 6.5.4+), it is possible to become the condor user. In 7.2.0+, it is also possible to become other users who have previously submitted jobs. Since the condor user is always the queue super user (regardless of configuration), becoming the condor user gives one power to modify all other jobs in the queue, effectively allowing one to become those users as well. Therefore, the only additional exposure added in 7.2.0+ is the ability to become users who no longer have jobs in the queue but who submitted jobs to this schedd in the past (since the schedd was last started).

## Ticket #1018: queue super user cannot drop privs

> As of 7.2.0, the queue super user has the power to change the value of Owner to any owner who has a job in the queue or who has ever had a job in the queue during the life of the current running schedd. This was added for `JobRouter`.
>
> The problem with this is that condor\_shadow authenticates to the schedd as the condor user (always a super user) when performing set\_job\_attr operations on behalf of chirp calls made by the job. Therefore, the job can change its own Owner attribute, requeue itself, and gain access to somebody else's account. It can only gain access to accounts that have submitted a job to condor or to the "condor" user, and it can not gain access to root, because condor will not run jobs as root.
>
> A pithy example of how to reproduce the problem appears in a remark from tannenba below.
>
> The solution we decided to pursue in 7.2.5 and 7.4.1 is to add a qmgmt command that allows the queue super user to reduce privileges to that of an ordinary user so that all subsequent operations in the qmgmt session are done as though by the other user (like seteuid() in unix). The job queue updater used by the shadow (and local starter) does this in all cases immediately after establishing a qmgmt session. This addresses the problem of chirp but also reduces risk of other operations being allowed that should not be.
>
> Changing the shadow to authenticate as the user instead of condor is another possible solution. This is problematic, because not all authentication methods support authenticating as the user from within a condor daemon. For those methods that do support authentication based on priv state (such as FS), the security session cache does not keep track of what priv state was used to create the session, so we would either need to fix that, or change all shadow --> schedd communication to be done as the user (including the daemon keepalive and possibly other things I am forgetting).
>
> Removing the power of the super user to directly change Owner is another option. In fact, with the "seteuid()" qmgmt operation, the `JobRouter` should no longer need the queue super user to have the power to directly set Owner. However, changing the `JobRouter` seems like a larger than necessary change in the stable series, so this should probably be done in the current development series, leaving the extra super user power as is in the stable series if not beyond.

### Remarks:

> *2009-Dec-02 18:41:01 by danb:*
>
> Todd had an idea: just make Owner immutable. `JobRouter` does not need to change the owner. It just needs to be able to set it.
>
> I'm planning to make a patch that does that in 7.2 and forward. I already have a patch that implements qmgmt seteuid, and it's not very complex, but given the immutable Owner, I think the seteuid patch can be safely put in 7.5 instead of the stable series.

> I have attached two patches, one proposed for stable series 7.2 and 7.4 and the other for the development series 7.5. The stable series patch makes Owner immutable. The development series patch makes the job queue updater (used by shadow and local starter) set its effective qmgmt owner name to the user.

Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
