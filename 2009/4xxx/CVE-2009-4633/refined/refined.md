  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple programming errors in container and codec implementations within FFmpeg.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds array index read",
      "Off-by-one indexing error",
      "Pointer arithmetic bug leading to out-of-bounds read",
      "Assignment vs. comparison operator mix-up leading to heap overflow",

       "Integer underflow by 1 leading to out-of-bounds pointer usage",
      "Type confusion leading to stack-based buffer overflow"

    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash), arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the program, memory corruption, heap overflow, stack overflow, stack pointer wrap-around.",
    "attack_vectors": "Opening a malformed media file or stream.",

  "affected_components": [
      "Vorbis audio codec",
      "Ogg container implementation",
      "FF Video 1 codec",
      "MPEG audio codec",
      "H264 video codec",
      "MOV container implementation",
      "Oggedc container implementation"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerabilities stem from various programming errors, including out-of-bounds reads, off-by-one errors, incorrect pointer arithmetic, incorrect use of assignment operators, integer underflows, type confusion and missing validation. Some vulnerabilities can lead to out-of-bounds reads being used as function pointers, which is particularly serious. Some integer underflows can cause stack pointer wraparound, which can be exploited. The various vulnerabilities are found through fuzzing and code auditing, the blog post mentions a number of specific examples and also refers to divide by zero, infinite looping, and classic integer overflows as other types of bugs found."
