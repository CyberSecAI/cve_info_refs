How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-0407

It was discovered that PCSCD, a daemon to access smart cards, was vulnerable
to a buffer overflow allowing a local attacker to elevate his privileges
to root.

One of those attacker-controlled overflows is demonstrated by MWR Lab reproducer.  This attack vector is mitigated on RHEL5 by FORTIFY_SOURCE, reducing impact to crash.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-03 13:07:03 UTC  ``` Upstream commits:   <http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pcsclite/?sc=1&rev=4208>   <http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/pcsclite/?sc=1&rev=4334>  Issues should be fixed in upstream version 1.5.4.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-04 14:01:36 UTC  ``` pcscd in RHEL5 and Fedora runs as user root, but is confined in a restricted SELinux domain (pcscd_t).   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-11 08:09:20 UTC  ``` Public now via Debian DSA-2059-1:   <http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2059>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c11)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-15 19:23:27 UTC  ``` pcsc-lite-1.5.2-4.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/pcsc-lite-1.5.2-4.fc12>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c12)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-15 19:23:36 UTC  ``` pcsc-lite-1.5.2-3.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/pcsc-lite-1.5.2-3.fc11>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c13)  Fedora Update System    2010-06-16 17:40:57 UTC  ``` pcsc-lite-1.5.2-3.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.

The descriptions are a bit confusing, but by the sounds of them, [CVE-2009-4901](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4901) and [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407) affect us, and [CVE-2009-4902](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4902) is due to the incorrect fix for [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407) (which we had not previously fixed, so would not affect us).  Name: [CVE-2009-4901](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4901)  The MSGFunctionDemarshall function in winscard_svc.c in the PC/SC Smart Card daemon (aka PCSCD) in MUSCLE PCSC-Lite before 1.5.4 might allow local users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via crafted SCARD_SET_ATTRIB message data, which is improperly demarshalled and triggers a buffer over-read, a related issue to [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407).  Name: [CVE-2009-4902](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4902)  Buffer overflow in the MSGFunctionDemarshall function in winscard_svc.c in the PC/SC Smart Card daemon (aka PCSCD) in MUSCLE PCSC-Lite 1.5.4 and earlier might allow local users to gain privileges via crafted SCARD_CONTROL message data, which is improperly demarshalled.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407).  Name: [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407)  Multiple buffer overflows in the MSGFunctionDemarshall function in winscard_svc.c in the PC/SC Smart Card daemon (aka PCSCD) in MUSCLE PCSC-Lite before 1.5.4 allow local users to gain privileges via crafted message data, which is improperly demarshalled.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c16)  Asha Akkiangady    2010-06-18 17:49:26 UTC  ``` Installed 'pcsc-lite-1.4.4-2.el5_5' and performed smart card regression tests such as token enroll/format/pin reset etc., looks good.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c20)  Tomas Hoger    2010-06-23 09:57:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c15)) > MITRE assigned another two CVE names to this issue: [CVE-2009-4901](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4901) and > [CVE-2009-4902](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4902).

Yes, these assignments are somewhat confusing.  Issue was originally reported and fixed upstream in 2009 (as mentioned in [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c7)), but they were only recognized as security fix in 2010, when [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407) was assigned to all these issues.  Later on Mitre assigned [CVE-2009-4901](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4901) for one of the issues originally under [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407), apparently due to different impact (see [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c6)).  [CVE-2009-4902](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4902) was also assigned for an incomplete fix for [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407) (sic, different years make it even more confusing) in the upstream commit (see [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c7)), even though it's not clear if such incomplete fix was ever used in any upstream or vendor release.  Our updates addressing [CVE-2010-0407](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0407) will include complete fix that does not introduce [CVE-2009-4902](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4902).  Statement CVE-2009-4902:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of pcsc-lite as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c21)  JJ Keijser    2010-06-24 09:23:14 UTC  ``` FYI: this security fix breaks Aladdin's pkiclient 5.0 on at least Fedora 12: With pcsc-lite-libs 1.5.2-3 installed I can use   pkcs11-tool --module /lib64/libeToken.so.5 -L without errors.

This is because the code is: 	if ((ctStr->cbRecvLength > sizeof(ctStr->cbRecvLength)) instead of: 	if ((ctStr->cbRecvLength > sizeof(ctStr->pbRecvBuffer))  ctStr->cbRecvLength is a uint32_t so sizeof returns 4. ctStr->pbRecvBuffer is the buffer.  So (nearly) any code that use SCardControl() will get an error. SCardControl() is used in particular with pinpad readers.  To know if the reported problem is the one I describe you should start pcscd in debug mode. See <http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/ccid.html#support>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c28)  Tomas Hoger    2010-07-01 14:01:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #27](show_bug.cgi?id=596426#c27)) > So (nearly) any code that use SCardControl() will get an error. > SCardControl() is used in particular with pinpad readers.

Ok, my comment was bad / confusing, I realized shorty after posting it.  Relevant change is from <= (i.e. rejecting all queries where specified attribute length is valid and not exceeding pbAttr size) to > (i.e. rejecting requests with excessive cbAttrLen length value).  Upstream change from struct pointer to struct made my comment confusing.
