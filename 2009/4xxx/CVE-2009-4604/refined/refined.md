Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw. The `mamboleto.php` file in the Mamboleto Joomla! component includes the `pre.php` file using a path that is susceptible to manipulation through the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application takes user-controlled input (`mosConfig_absolute_path`) and uses it within an `include_once` statement, allowing an attacker to include remote files.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter before using it in the include statement.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable Joomla! server. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system, including data theft, defacement, and further malicious activity.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `mamboleto.php` file.
    *   **Malicious URL:** The attacker injects a malicious URL into the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter in the GET request to include and execute code from their server.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Joomla! server.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** The attacker needs to know that the Mamboleto component is installed and the path to the vulnerable `mamboleto.php` file
    *   **Remote File Hosting:** The attacker must have a server or web space where they can host their malicious code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in line 123 of `mamboleto.php`:
    ```php
    include_once( $mosConfig_absolute_path . '/administrator/components/com_mamboleto/include/pre.php');
    ```
*   The exploit proof of concept URL is provided as:
    ```
    http://server/acomponents/com_mamboleto/mamboleto.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=[INDONESIANCODER-666]
    ```
    Where `[INDONESIANCODER-666]` is intended to be replaced with a malicious URL controlled by the attacker.
