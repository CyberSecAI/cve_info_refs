    *   **Affected Versions:** 0.1.1 and below.
    *  **Solution:** Upgrade to version 0.1.2.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerabilities stem from various coding issues within the third-party extensions, including:

*   Improper input sanitization leading to SQL Injection
*   Insufficient output encoding resulting in XSS
*   Lack of proper path validation leading to directory traversal
*  Insecure handling of sensitive data leading to Information Disclosure

**Impact:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:

*   **SQL Injection:** Data breaches, modification, or deletion; potential for complete database compromise.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Execution of malicious scripts within the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or website defacement.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Unauthorized access to files and directories outside the web root, potentially leading to exposure of sensitive information or system compromise.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Exploited by injecting malicious SQL code through vulnerable input fields or parameters.
*   **XSS:** Injected through vulnerable input fields or parameters.
*   **Directory Traversal:** Exploited by manipulating file paths to access unauthorized files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   An attacker needs to have access to the vulnerable TYPO3 instance and knowledge of the vulnerable extensions.
*   Ability to craft malicious payloads relevant to the vulnerability.
*  For XSS, the victim has to interact with the malicious code through the web application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory is a "Collective Security Bulletin" (CSB), grouping multiple less critical vulnerabilities to reduce the workload of the TYPO3 security team.
*   The vulnerable extensions are third-party and not part of the TYPO3 core.
*   The advisory provides specific solutions for each vulnerability, generally suggesting updates or removal of the affected extensions.
* The "Directory Listing" extension had previously been removed from TER in 2006, and reintroduced in early 2009 because of a bug in the TER.
*   The advisory recommends following the TYPO3 SECURITY Guide and subscribing to the `typo3-announce` mailing list for future security bulletins.
