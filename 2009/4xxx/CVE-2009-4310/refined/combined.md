How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Windows 2000 SP4](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/2000/default.aspx) [Windows 2003 SP2](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx) [Windows XP SP3](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-xp/) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows Media Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the Intel Indeo41 codec which is accessed by various applications through the Video Compression Manager. This codec is registered to handle IV41 streams within a container such as the AVI format. While decompressing a video stream malicious data can cause a loop to execute excessively and consequently corrupt the application's stack. By providing specific values this can lead to an exploitable condition which can be leveraged by attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user accessing the file. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/954157.mspx> |

# Microsoft Security Advisory: Vulnerabilities in the Indeo codec could allow remote code execution: December 8, 2009

Important This article contains information that shows you how to help lower security settings or how to turn off security features on a computer. You can make these changes to work around a specific problem. Before you make these changes, we recommend that you evaluate the risks that are associated with implementing this workaround in your particular environment. If you implement this workaround, take any appropriate additional steps to help protect the computer.

Microsoft has released a Microsoft security advisory about this issue for IT professionals. The security advisory contains additional security-related information. To view the security advisory, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/954157.mspx>

## INTRODUCTION

### About the Microsoft in-box Indeo codec

There are multiple ways that the Indeo codec may be used, and certain applications may require the codec. The Indeo codec may be required when you visit legitimate Web sites and in corporate environment line-of-business applications. This may be a more common scenario for customers who are running older Windows operating systems. On the other hand, customers who do not have to use the codec may want to take an additional step and unregister the codec completely. This article covers two ways that the codec can be unregistered: by using the Fix-it option provided below or by manually unregistering the codec.

#### Unregister the Microsoft in-box Indeo codec by using the Fix-it option

Click the **Fix this problem** button in the first column of the following table to unregister the Indeo codec on your computer. After you do this, the codec cannot be used by any application. This tool both unregisters the codec binaries from the system and adds ACLs to prevent their use. A second Fix-it is available that reverses this action if you decide to do so in the future.

| Use this Fix-it button to unregister the Indeo codec files automatically | Use this Fix-it button to re-register the Indeo codec files automatically |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |

#### Unregister the Microsoft in-box Indeo codec manually

There are multiple files that are associated with the Microsoft in-box Indeo codec. Depending on the Windows operating system, not all the files that are listed here may be present on the computer. Users who want to manually unregister the Microsoft in-box Indeo codec files must verify that these files exist on the computer, locate the directory in which the files exist, and then run the sample script that is included with this article.

To remove the Microsoft in-box codec from the system manually, we suggest renaming the Microsoft in-box codec binaries to something like ‘binaryname.old’. This allows you to reverse the process in the future should you ever want to regain Indeo functionality. This article includes a sample script that can be used to do this in your environment in a more automated manner.

Note Unregistering Indeo codecs from the system may cause application compatibility issues if you try to play content that requires these codecs.

Note This table lists the binary name and the version of the Microsoft Indeo in-box codecs that you can unregister. It does not include any third-party codecs.

#### Re-enable the Indeo functionality after this security update is installed

Warning This workaround may make a computer or a network more vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such as viruses. We do not recommend this workaround but are providing this information so that you can implement this workaround at your own discretion. Use this workaround at your own risk.

This security update disables some Indeo functionality by not letting Windows Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player use the codec. Certain users may require this functionality and can re-enable this functionality of the Indeo codec by reverting the registry key changes that are made by this security update. The registry key changes are different on the different versions of the Windows operating system.

Note Reverting the registry key changes may expose the user to security issues and weaken the security profile of the computer.

To revert the APPCOMPAT mitigation without uninstalling the security update, please see the following Windows operating system specific directions that are appropriate for your computer.

### Known issues

#### The Quartz.dll file is listed as an unsigned binary

Consider the following scenario:

* You install this update on a computer that is running Microsoft Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 and that has DirectX 7 or DirectX 8 installed.
* You upgrade the system to DirectX 8 or DirectX 9.
* You try to update the system again with this update.

In this scenario, the Quartz.dll file is successfully updated to the secured version. However, the file may be listed as an unsigned binary.

To avoid this issue, follow these steps:

1. Uninstall the update for the earlier version of Microsoft DirectShow.
2. Manually delete the following catalog file:

   %systemroot%\system32\catroot\{F750E6C3-38EE-11D1-85E5-00C04FC295EE}\KB971633.cat
3. Upgrade to the newer version of DirectShow.
4. Install the security update that is appropriate for the new version of DirectX.
