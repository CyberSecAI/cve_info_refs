Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2009-4052.

The provided documents reference two separate vulnerabilities, but neither of them has an official CVE assignment of CVE-2009-4052.

**1. Vulnerability in JSF Tree Control (APAR PK90616):**

*   **Root Cause:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the JSF Tree Control.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The JSF Tree Control is vulnerable to XSS.
*  **Impact:** A malicious user can inject client-side scripts into the web page, which can lead to the following:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Executing arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation via malicious code injection in the JSF Tree Control.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script, which often occurs through user-controlled input to the vulnerable component.

**2. Vulnerability in JavaScript Resource Servlet (APAR PK94324):**

*   **Root Cause:** JavaScript injection vulnerability due to lack of input validation in the JavaScript Resource Servlet when acquiring the locale identifier from the request parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The JavaScript Resource Servlet does not validate the locale name received in the request parameter, allowing arbitrary JavaScript injection.
*   **Impact:** A malicious user can inject arbitrary JavaScript onto the page, potentially leading to the same consequences as the JSF Tree Control XSS vulnerability (stealing cookies, redirection, website defacement, arbitrary JS execution).
*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a lack of input validation via the locale parameter in the request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the locale parameter within a request to the server.

Both vulnerabilities were fixed in Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software Version 7.0.0.10.

Given that neither APAR has the specified CVE, I will respond with **NOINFO**.
