{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `editpage-2.php` script, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code due to insufficient input validation in the 'filename' and 'text' parameters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote command execution",
      "Unrestricted file upload",
        "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker sends a specially crafted POST request to `editpage-2.php` with a payload to create a PHP shell.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and the ability to send HTTP requests. The script is exploited remotely."
  },
  "exploit_details": {
    "exploit_code": "The provided Perl script automates the exploitation process:\n\n1. It checks if a shell already exists at `/content/shell_vup.php`.\n2. If the shell does not exist, it sends a POST request to `editpage-2.php` to inject a PHP shell into `/content/shell_vup.php`.\n3. Once the shell is uploaded, the script provides an interactive shell interface to execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
    "parameters": [
        "Target host",
        "Path to Agoko CMS installation"
