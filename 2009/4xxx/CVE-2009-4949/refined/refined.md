The content is related to CVE-2009-4949.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in insecure coding practices within various third-party TYPO3 extensions. These include SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Information Disclosure, and Directory Traversal vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The following vulnerabilities are present:

*   **SQL Injection:** Allows attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages, which can compromise user sessions or redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposes sensitive information to unauthorized parties.
*  **Directory Traversal:** Allows attackers to access files and directories outside the intended web root, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:

*   Data breaches through SQL injection.
*   Compromised user sessions and malicious redirects through XSS.
*   Exposure of sensitive information.
*   Access to files outside the web root.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are through web requests targeting the vulnerable third-party TYPO3 extensions. Specifically:
*   SQL injection is exploited by injecting malicious SQL code via input parameters.
*   XSS is exploited by injecting malicious javascript via input parameters or data stored within the website.
*   Information disclosure is exploited through insecure configuration of the software.
*   Directory traversal is exploited by manipulating file paths.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected web application. They do not need privileged access but would need to be able to identify the specific vulnerable extensions being used and how to exploit them.
