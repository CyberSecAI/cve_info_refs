Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-4696:

**Summary:**

*   The provided content indicates that RadNICS Gold v5 has multiple vulnerabilities including SQL Injection, Blind SQL Injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS). 
*   The exploit-db entry lists both CVE-2009-4697 and CVE-2009-4696.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `fid` parameter of the `index.php` script when accessing the `view_forum` action. This allows an attacker to inject SQL queries into the database.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and sanitization.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or even take control of the database server.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `fid` parameter in the URL, specifically when `a=view_forum`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests with modified parameters.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Similar to SQL injection, user controlled input in the `fid` parameter is not properly sanitized. The application doesn't directly output the results of the query, however an attacker can infer results based on the application's response (true/false).
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input validation and sanitization.
    *    **Impact:** Allows an attacker to infer data from the database via a true/false query evaluation.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `fid` parameter in the URL, specifically when `a=view_forum`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests with modified parameters.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application does not properly encode user-supplied input when displaying it on the page.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding/sanitization.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the page, which can be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, redirection, phishing, or other malicious activities.
        *   An attacker can execute javascript when viewing user lists through `index.php?a=ulist&mode=9&order=[XSS]&cat=1`
        *   An attacker can execute javascript when viewing a forum thread through  `index.php?a=view_forum&fid=[XSS]&admin=0`.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `order` parameter when `a=ulist` and the `fid` parameter when `a=view_forum`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests with modified parameters.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Application:** RadNICS Gold v5
*   **Programming Language:** PHP
*   **Dorks**
