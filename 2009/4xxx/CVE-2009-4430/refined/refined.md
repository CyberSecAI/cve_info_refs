Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query. Specifically, the `product_id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

*   **Weakness:** Input Validation Error. The application fails to sanitize the `product_id` parameter, leading to a SQL Injection vulnerability.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of the application
    *   Access or modification of data
    *   Exploitation of latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database

*   **Attack Vector:**  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious SQL code into the `product_id` parameter of the URL.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.

**URL Example:**
```
http://server/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=shop.flypage&product_id=[SOA injection]
```
The "[SOA injection]" would be replaced with malicious SQL code.

The provided content gives more details than the official CVE description by pinpointing the vulnerable parameter (`product_id`) and providing an example of a vulnerable URL.
