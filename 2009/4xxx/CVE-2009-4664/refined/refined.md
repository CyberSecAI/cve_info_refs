Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insecure temporary file handling within the `fwbuilder` application's generated iptables scripts. Specifically, the scripts created temporary files in a predictable location (`/tmp/.fwbuilder.out` or `/tmp/.fwbuilder.tempdir.$$/fwbuilder.out`), making them susceptible to symlink attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The scripts were creating temporary files in a shared directory (`/tmp`) with predictable names.
*   **Race Condition:** The method of generating the temporary file name based on the process ID (`$$`) and then creating a directory, and a file inside, still leaves a small window of opportunity where a local attacker could create the directory and symlink the file, causing the script to write to an arbitrary location.
*   **Symlink Vulnerability:** A local attacker could exploit this by creating a symbolic link with the same name as the temporary file before the script executes, causing the script to write to a location controlled by the attacker instead of the intended temporary file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A successful symlink attack would allow a local attacker to overwrite any file that the script user had write access to. This could lead to:
    *   **Data corruption:** Overwriting configuration files, log files, or other critical system files.
    *   **Privilege escalation:** Potentially overwriting executable files to execute malicious code with the permissions of the vulnerable script.
    *  **Denial of Service:** Overwriting important files and render a system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker must be able to execute commands on the system where the vulnerable `fwbuilder` script is run.
*   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a symbolic link in `/tmp` before the vulnerable script creates its temporary file.
*   **Race condition exploitation:** The attacker exploits the time window between the script generating the temporary filename, creating the directory, and the file inside, to place their symlink to a target file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the machine where the vulnerable `fwbuilder` script is being executed.
*   **User with Write access:**  The attacker must be able to execute the vulnerable script either directly or indirectly through a process that does.

**Additional details:**

* The vulnerability was present in `fwbuilder-3.0.5-2.fc12` as shipped with Fedora Rawhide, and was addressed in `fwbuilder-3.0.7` by creating a directory, and then a file inside, with a new method.
* The initial fix using process IDs to create directories was deemed insufficient by the reporter, who suggested using `mktemp` to create unique and safer temporary files and directories.
