The provided content relates to CVE-2009-4339.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities stem from flaws in third-party TYPO3 extensions, specifically SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in multiple extensions, including:
  - car
  - xds_staff
  - danp_documentdirs
  - ste_prayer2
  - pd_resources
  - hs_religiousartgallery
  - ste_parish_admin
  - pd_calendar
  - slideshow
  - mf_subscription
  - no_indexed_search
  - jobexchange

- XSS vulnerabilities are present in multiple extensions, including:
  - dr_blob
  - nl_listman
  - ste_prayer2
  - pd_resources
  - hs_religiousartgallery
  - ste_parish_admin
  - pd_calendar
  - no_indexed_search
  - trainincdb
  - zid_linklist
  - vshoutbox
  - fe_rtenews
- Information disclosure vulnerability in aba_watchdog

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially manipulate database queries to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, or even take control of the database server.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Information disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors vary depending on the vulnerability type.
- **SQL Injection:** Exploiting SQL injection flaws typically involves manipulating user input fields or other parameters to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript or other scripts into web pages, which are then executed by the browsers of unsuspecting users when they visit those pages.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information stored by the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For SQL injection, attackers would need to be able to interact with vulnerable components of the application where they can manipulate input parameters or directly interact with the database.
- For XSS, attackers need to be able to inject malicious scripts into the application, which could be done by manipulating inputs or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to inject into the application.
- For Information Disclosure, an attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable component, allowing them to extract the sensitive information.
