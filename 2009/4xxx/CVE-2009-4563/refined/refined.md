  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The exploit takes advantage of two vulnerabilities: a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the admin login page and a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows changing the administrator's password.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the admin login page and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in the password reset functionality.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain administrative access to the ZenPhoto gallery. The XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to log the admin's password if the admin is not logged in, while the CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to change the admin's password if the admin is already logged in.",
    "Attack vectors": "The XSS vulnerability requires tricking the admin into clicking a specially crafted link. The CSRF vulnerability requires the admin to click a link to a malicious page that will automatically submit a form to change the password.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious links and trick the administrator into clicking them. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger either of the vulnerabilities."
