{
  "CVE-2009-4567": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Viscacha application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the instant messenger fields within the user profile settings.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "A regular user can inject malicious JavaScript code into their profile. When an administrator views the user's profile, this injected script will execute in the administrator's browser. This could allow the attacker to steal the admin's session cookie, leading to privilege escalation and complete administrative access.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A user must first inject malicious code into their profile's instant messenger fields via the editprofile.php page.",
          "The attacker must then trick an administrator into clicking a crafted link that will lead them to the vulnerable user's profile page using the profile.php?action=ims page. Specifically, the crafted link will trigger the injected code to execute when the admin views the user profile."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a regular user account on the vulnerable Viscacha forum. They need the ability to edit their user profile."
    },
      "technical_details": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of the instant messenger fields in the user profile. The attacker modifies these fields to contain malicious JavaScript code like `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`. When the administrator visits a link such as `http://[server]/viscacha/profile.php?action=ims&type=msn&id=1`, the injected JavaScript is executed within the administrator's browser session."
