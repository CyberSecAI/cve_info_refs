  "CVE-2009-4734": {
    "Description": "The provided content details a blind SQL injection vulnerability in Allomani Movies & Clips v2.7.0.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the 'login.php' script, specifically the 'username' parameter, before using it in an SQL query.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Blind SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to unsanitized user input.",
      "Lack of Input Sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize the username parameter, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to extract sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, from the database. In this specific exploit the attacker extracts the first 8 characters of the username and the first 13 characters of the password.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to 'login.php' with a manipulated 'username' parameter.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. They need to know the target URL and path to the login.php file. No authentication is needed."
