The provided content relates to CVE-2009-4636.

Root cause of vulnerability:
Multiple programming errors exist in the implementations of various container formats and codecs in ffmpeg.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Out-of-bounds array index read in vorbis_dec.c.
- Off-by-one indexing error in vp3.c.
- Pointer arithmetic bug in oggparsevorbis.c.
- Assignment vs. comparison operator mix-up in vorbis_dec.c.
- Integer underflow leading to stack pointer wrap-around in vorbis_dec.c.
- Integer underflow by 1 in mov.c.
- Type confusion bug in mov.c / utils.c
- Other issues such as divide by zero, infinite looping, stack-based buffer overflow due to missing bounds check, classic integer overflow.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of service.
- Execution of arbitrary code.
- Memory corruption.
- Heap overflow.
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Stack pointer wrap around.

Attack vectors:
- Opening a malformed media file.
- Opening a malformed media stream.
- Specific sequence of tags in MOV container

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to provide a malformed media file or stream.
- For specific issues, ability to manipulate tag ordering in MOV containers.
