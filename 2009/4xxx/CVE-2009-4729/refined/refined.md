Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-4729:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The x10 media adult script 1.7 has multiple vulnerabilities stemming from insufficient input sanitization in various script files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `report.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter. Both standard and blind SQL injection are possible.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple files are vulnerable to XSS via various parameters:
    *   `includes/video_ad.php` via the `pic_id` parameter.
    *   `linkvideos_listing.php` via the `category` parameter.
    *   `templates/header1.php` via the `id` parameter.
    *   `video_listing.php` via the `key` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or deletion.
    *   The attacker can retrieve sensitive information, potentially including user credentials.
    *   The attacker can gain control over database operations, which could lead to complete server compromise.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   An attacker could inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to:
        *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
        *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
        *   Defacement of the website
        *   Phishing attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   HTTP GET request with a crafted `id` parameter to `report.php`

*   **XSS:**
    *   HTTP GET requests with crafted parameters (`pic_id`, `category`, `id`, `key`) to the specified files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, meaning anyone who can access the website can attempt exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit information includes specific vulnerable files and parameters.
*   The provided examples show how to exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting SQL code and JavaScript code.
*   The exploit mentions other vulnerabilities that are associated with CVE-2009-4730
