Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4456

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `news_detail.php` file of Green Desktiny Customer Support Helpdesk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Specifically, the `id` parameter in `news_detail.php` is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:**  An attacker can extract sensitive information (like email and passwords) from the `gd_staff` database table.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to potentially modify data, add new data, or even gain control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `news_detail.php`.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries to be injected into the vulnerable parameter.

**Technical Details:**
*   The exploit uses the following injection string in the `id` parameter: `-666/**/union/**/select/**/666,666,666,666,666,666,666,666,666,concat_ws(0x3a,email,password),@@version,666/**/from/**/gd_staff--`
* This string leverages a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the `email` and `password` fields from the `gd_staff` table, along with the database version, effectively dumping user credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects Green Desktiny Customer Support Helpdesk version 2.3.1 and possibly earlier versions.
* The software is described as a commercial product priced at $68.
* The exploit was discovered by kaMtiEz.
