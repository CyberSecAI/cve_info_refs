{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying visit logs, and also discloses sensitive file paths.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Full Path Disclosure"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the statistics. Additionally, attackers can gain sensitive information about the server's file structure due to full path disclosure vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Malicious JavaScript code injected via the URL parameter used for the visited page, which will be stored in the logs and executed when viewing logs.",
    "Manipulated URL parameters can inject XSS code",
    "Direct access to include files reveals server's internal file paths."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can inject malicious script through the 'site' URL parameter that is logged by Power Phlogger. No special privileges are needed for XSS attacks. Full path disclosure vulnerability requires only network access to the vulnerable URLs."
