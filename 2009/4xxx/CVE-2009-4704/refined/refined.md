     "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can result in various consequences, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of website content, redirection to malicious websites, and potential compromise of the server itself. This can lead to loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the website and its associated data.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attackers need to have a basic understanding of web application vulnerabilities and the specific weaknesses present in the affected TYPO3 extensions. They would also need to be able to craft malicious payloads such as SQL injection queries, javascript code or path traversal sequences. Access to the affected TYPO3 instances is also required."
