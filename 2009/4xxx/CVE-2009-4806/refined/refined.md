Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4806:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content does not contain the description.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `save_user.asp` file within Document Library version 1.0.1. This allows an attacker to modify admin account information by directly accessing and submitting data to the `save_user.asp` file, bypassing intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `save_user.asp` file can be accessed directly, without proper authorization checks.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The script does not properly validate or sanitize user-provided data when updating the admin account details.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Change of Admin Credentials:** Attackers can modify the administrator's username and password.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Once the admin credentials have been changed, the attacker gains full control of the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker can send a crafted HTTP POST request directly to `admin/save_user.asp`.
- **Web Interface:** An attacker can directly access the `admin/save_user.asp` page and submit the form to update the admin credentials

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the web server hosting the application.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the path to `admin/save_user.asp`.
- **No prior authentication required** to access vulnerable endpoint.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability in Document Library 1.0.1 allows an attacker to change the administrator credentials by directly accessing `admin/save_user.asp` due to lack of access control and input validation. This would give the attacker full control of the application.
