- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the URL.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, in this case, usernames and passwords.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploitable through a crafted URL. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and must have knowledge of SQL syntax.
