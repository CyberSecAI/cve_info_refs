{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses insecure cookie handling for authentication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The application relies on cookie values ('cookid' and 'cookgid') for authentication, which can be easily manipulated by an attacker.",
       "The application checks only if 'usergid' is equal to 1 for admin access, without proper session validation."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain administrative access by setting a cookie with the value 'cookgid=1'.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker can manipulate the cookie values directly using browser developer tools or other means."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with manipulated cookies to the vulnerable application."
    ],
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists in the 'admin/header.php' file. The application attempts to get the user ID and group ID from the session. If the session values are not present or are empty, it retrieves the user ID and group ID from the 'cookid' and 'cookgid' cookies. The authentication check only verifies if the 'usergid' is equal to '1' to grant admin access."
