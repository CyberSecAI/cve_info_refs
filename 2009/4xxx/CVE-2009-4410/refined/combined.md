How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  fuse-2.8.1-1.fc11.i586 kernel-2.6.30.9-102.fc11.i586  How reproducible:  Run the attached program on a fuse filesystem.  The kernel should panic.  Additional info:  This seems to have been fixed upstream already: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=0bd87182d3ab18a32a8e9175d3f68754c58e3432>  I've checked the 'security' bugzilla bit as it's easy for a regular user to bring the machine down with this.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=549400#c1)  Daphne Shaw    2009-12-21 15:35:27 UTC  ``` Here's the output.  kernel BUG at mm/highmem.c:260! invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP  last sysfs file: /sys/devices/virtual/block/dm-0/range Modules linked in: fuse ipv6 ppdev floppy parport_pc parport i2c_piix4 pcnet32 i2c_core pcspkr mii BusLogic mptspi mptscsih mptbase aic7xxx sym53c8xx scsi_transport_spi [last unloaded: scsi_wait_scan]  Pid: 1597, comm: a.out Not tainted (2.6.30.9-96.fc11.i586 #1) VMware Virtual Platform EIP: 0060:[<c0491dbd>] EFLAGS: 00010246 CPU: 0 EIP is at kunmap_high+0x20/0x8f EAX: 00000000 EBX: ff6c0000 ECX: c0a3f100 EDX: 00000a02 ESI: 00000004 EDI: ff6c0004 EBP: f61b5e3c ESP: f61b5e38 DS: 007b ES: 007b FS: 00d8 GS: 0033 SS: 0068 Process a.out (pid: 1597, ti=f61b4000 task=f619f1a0 task.ti=f61b4000) Stack: 00000000 f61b5e44 c041fd3e f61b5e74 f80badbb 01000206 ff6c0000 f654a480 f60d8000 00000001 00000004 00000000 f60b25e0 00000000 00000004 f61b5ef8 f80bc7c5 00000004 00000001 00000000 f605b380 f654a480 00000000 f60dbe00 Call Trace: [<c041fd3e>] ? kunmap+0x52/0x54 [<f80badbb>] ? fuse_ioctl_copy_user+0xb8/0xd1 [fuse] [<f80bc7c5>] ? fuse_file_do_ioctl+0x3c1/0x42b [fuse] [<f80bc840>] ? fuse_file_ioctl+0x0/0x14 [fuse] [<f80bc84f>] ? fuse_file_ioctl+0xf/0x14 [fuse] [<c04b5689>] ? vfs_ioctl+0x1d/0x74 [<c04b5b55>] ? do_vfs_ioctl+0x475/0x4af [<c0540e67>] ? selinux_file_ioctl+0x3f/0x42 [<c04b5bd5>] ? sys_ioctl+0x46/0x66 [<c0403535>] ? syscall_call+0x7/0xb Code: c1 e3 0c 81 eb 00 00 00 40 eb e2 55 89 e5 53 0f 1f 44 00 00 89 c3 b8 a0 ba 92 c0 e8 33 a7 29 00 89 d8 e8 2f ff ff ff 85 c0 75 04 <0f> 0b eb fe 8b 15 e0 9a 8c c0 81 ea 00 20 90 00 81 e2 00 00 c0  EIP: [<c0491dbd>] kunmap_high+0x20/0x8f SS:ESP 0068:f61b5e38 ---[ end trace 3ae2055baeb31d7d ]--- Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception Pid: 1597, comm: a.out Tainted: G      D    2.6.30.9-96.fc11.i586 #1 Call Trace: [<c072a586>] ? printk+0x14/0x16 [<c072a4d0>] panic+0x3e/0xe0 [<c072d183>] oops_end+0x92/0xa1 [<c0405e14>] die+0x58/0x5e [<c072ca43>] do_trap+0x89/0xa2 [<c040465f>] ? do_invalid_op+0x0/0x85 [<c04046da>] do_invalid_op+0x7b/0x85 [<c0491dbd>] ? kunmap_high+0x20/0x8f [<c0423803>] ? set_next_entity+0xa0/0x10c [<c0402286>] ? __switch_to+0x78/0xfb [<c042428b>] ? pick_next_task_fair+0x87/0x8e [<c072adfe>] ? __schedule+0x761/0x7ab [<c072c7ed>] error_code+0x6d/0x80 [<c040465f>] ? do_invalid_op+0x0/0x85 [<c0491dbd>] ? kunmap_high+0x20/0x8f [<c041fd3e>] kunmap+0x52/0x54 [<f80badbb>] fuse_ioctl_copy_user+0xb8/0xd1 [fuse] [<f80bc7c5>] fuse_file_do_ioctl+0x3c1/0x42b [fuse] [<f80bc840>] ? fuse_file_ioctl+0x0/0x14 [fuse] [<f80bc84f>] fuse_file_ioctl+0xf/0x14 [fuse] [<c04b5689>] vfs_ioctl+0x1d/0x74 [<c04b5b55>] do_vfs_ioctl+0x475/0x4af [<c0540e67>] ? selinux_file_ioctl+0x3f/0x42 [<c04b5bd5>] sys_ioctl+0x46/0x66 [<c0403535>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=549400#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-12-21 15:47:05 UTC  ``` Thanks for the report, David.

So only distros using 2.6.30.y are affected. I am going to request a CVE name for this, and ping gregkh to get the fix in for 2.6.30.y. Since this fix is public, I will make the bug public but keep the reproducer private.

So, to fix this, we will need to add the patch in our Fedora kernel ourselves. Kyle, are we still supporting 2.6.30.y in F11?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=549400#c6)  Vincent Danen    2009-12-23 22:17:51 UTC  ``` This has been assigned [CVE-2009-4410](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4410).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=549400#c7)  Kyle McMartin    2009-12-24 16:10:10 UTC  ``` Yeah, I'll be updating it and F-12 to 2.6.32 this week while most people are away though so I don't step on any toes.

This patch does appear to be already applied to the latest F-11 kernel.  Can you confirm it's still vulnerable? I'm quite confused, looks like we're missing some upstream commits needed on top of the stable kernel to fix it then.

Where can I find 2.6.32-10-47 ?  In my test, kernel-2.6.30.10-105.fc11 was okay, but the PAE version of the same kernel (kernel-PAE-2.6.30.10-105.2.23.fc11.i686) was not.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=549400#c16)  Kyle McMartin    2010-06-23 07:27:44 UTC  ``` Weird, both those kernels contain that commit (2.6.30.10-105 and 2.6.30.10-105.2.23) since  * Thu Dec 24 2009 Kyle McMartin <kyle> 2.6.30.10-105 - fuse: fix kunmap in fuse_ioctl_copy_user, #549400  Not sure off hand what might be missing.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=549400#c17)  Daphne Shaw    2010-06-23 15:09:07 UTC  ``` Just to sanity check myself, I reproduced this again.  kernel-2.6.30.10-105.fc11 fails the ioctl with ENOSYS.  kernel-PAE-2.6.30.10-105.2.23.fc11.i686 panics.

Subject: CVE request - kernel: fuse_ioctl_copy_user() dos

Reported by David Shaw. There is a problem in the ioctl handler in the
fuse kernel code that causes a panic under some circumstances.

fuse_ioctl_copy_user() was introduced in 59efec7b (v2.6.29-rc1,
2008-11-26). This was fixed upstream but was missed in 2.6.30.y. The
most recent 2.6.31/32.y kernels already have this fix. So this only
affects distros that are still using 2.6.30.y.
