Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4614:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to **multiple Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** flaws present in Moa Gallery version 1.2.0 and earlier. This means that the application does not properly validate user-supplied input, which is then used in file inclusion operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes files based on the value provided through the `MOA_PATH` parameter in the URL.  This parameter is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to include malicious files from a remote server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This allows for complete compromise of the affected system, leading to data theft, modification, or system unavailability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the `MOA_PATH` parameter and points to an external file containing malicious code. The vulnerable scripts in the application include the provided URL without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Moa Gallery instance.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs access to a server that hosts a malicious file that will be included by the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know to use the `MOA_PATH` parameter to inject the remote file path.

**Vulnerable Files:**

The following files in the `sources/` directory are vulnerable:

*   `_error_funcs.php`
*   `_integrity_funcs.php`
*   `_template_component_admin.php`
*   `_template_component_gallery.php`
*   `_template_parser.php`
*   `mod_gallery_funcs.php`
*   `mod_image_funcs.php`
*   `mod_tag_funcs.php`
*   `mod_tag_view.php`
*   `mod_upgrade_funcs.php`
*   `mod_user_funcs.php`
*   `page_admin.php`
*   `page_gallery_add.php`
*   `page_gallery_view.php`
*   `page_image_add.php`
*   `page_image_view_full.php`
*    `page_login.php`
*   `page_sitemap.php`

**Additional Details**
*   The exploit-db content provides specific examples of how to exploit this vulnerability using the `MOA_PATH` parameter.
