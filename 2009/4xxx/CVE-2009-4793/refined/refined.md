Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4793 (as referenced in the exploit description)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `member_content.php` file of BandSite CMS 1.1.4. The code directly uses the `$_REQUEST['memid']` parameter in an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly includes user-supplied input (`$_REQUEST['memid']`) into an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
* **Insecure File Upload**: Another vulnerability mentioned is the ability to upload a shell through the admin panel. This allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially extracting sensitive information (e.g., usernames, passwords, emails).
    *   An attacker could potentially modify or delete database content.
    *   An attacker can potentially use this vulnerability to escalate privileges if the database user has sufficient access.
*   **File Upload:**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   An attacker can potentially gain full control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The attack vector is through the `members.php` script, by manipulating the `memid` parameter in the URL with malicious SQL code.
*   **File Upload:** Requires prior authentication as administrator. After login, the attacker can upload a malicious PHP script using the photo upload feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `members.php` page and manipulate the `memid` parameter.
*   **File Upload:** The attacker needs administrator access.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
    ```php
    $memid = $_REQUEST['memid'];
    if(isset($memid)){
        $query = "
            SELECT
                *
            FROM
                memberbios
            WHERE
                rec_id=$memid";
    }
    ```
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC) Examples:**
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1/members.php?memid=1 union all select 1,2,concat_ws(0x3a,admin_username,admin_password,admin_email),4,5,6,7 from config--
    http://127.0.0.1/members.php?memid=1 union all select 1,2,concat_ws(0x3a,db_username,db_password,db_name,db_host),4,5,6,7 from config--
    ```

**Additional Notes:**
* The exploit also mentions a file upload vulnerability in the admin panel, requiring administrator access.
