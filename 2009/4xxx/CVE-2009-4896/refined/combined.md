# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 [Gentoo Handbook (Official installation documentation)](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page")

 **Important**
Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

when I reported the bug I had no time to further investigate and I think I
did not report upstream because of lack of time at that point and later
forgot - which is sad.

The php webinterface is a third-party development for mlmmj but part of the
official release.

The last official release is 1.2.16 from 2009-Sep-05.

On <http://mlmmj.mmj.dk/files/> there is a newer version that is not linked
to on the official download page. This new version differs only in another
template-class beeing used, so all flaws should still be there.

Reported Upstream today: <http://mlmmj.org/node/84>

Package        : mlmmj
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-4896

Florian Streibelt reported a a directory traversal flaw in the way the
Mailing List Managing Made Joyful mailing list manager processed
users' requests originating from the administrator web interface
without enough input validation. A remote, authenticated attacker could
use these flaws to write and / or delete arbitrary files.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.15-1.1+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.17-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mlmmj package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I haven't looked at it yet, but if you and Morten are both happy with
it, I'm sure it'll be good enough for me. I will commit it shortly and

This should only need one ID. The flaw is unchecked input. Steve, if I'
mistaken, just yell.

CVE-2009-4896

Yeah, well, things like that happen. Would you agree that the attached
patch fixes the vulnerability?

Using a list of known-good-characters would be nice, but dot happens to
be a valid character in a list name.

I know that this is just semantics, but... While it is true that the
mlmmj-php-admin web interface is distributed along with mlmmj, it is not
a part of mlmmj itself, but is located in the contribs directory.

Best regards,
Morten

Thanks for bringing this up. I haven't used the mlmmj-php-admin in years,
but from looking at the patch that was proposed by Morten, I think it fixes
the issues and should be shipped!

Who is taking care of commiting this to mlmmj? Is there any embargo
involved?

Best
Christoph

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

 **Processor compatibility**

PowerPC CPUs can operate in two modes: *big-endian* and *little-endian*.

* The **ppc** and **ppc64** stages are *big-endian* stages and can be used with *any PowerPC* CPU, including some old Apple™ hardware.
* The **ppc64le** stages are *little-endian* stages and are created for running on *POWER8 and newer* CPUs.
* The **power9le** stages are *little-endian* stages optimized exclusively for *POWER9* CPUs.

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

Subject: CVE Request -- mlmmj -- Directory traversal flaw by editing and saving
 list entries via php-admin web interface

Hi Steve, vendors,

   Florian Streibelt (yet in 2009) reported:
   [1] <http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=259968#c0>

   a directory traversal flaw in the way mlmmj (Mailing List Managing Made
   Joyful), mailing list manager, processed users requests to edit and save
   list entries, originating from php-admin web interface. A remote,
   authenticated attacker could use these flaws to alter integrity of the system
   (write and / or delete arbitrary files) by providing a specially-crafted list
   variable content to the edit or save request.

   Florian, please correct me, if I mangled the attack scenario, and it's slightly
   different.

   Martin, Morten, are these two issues known upstream yet? Is there a patch for them already?

   Steve, could you please allocate two CVE-2009-XXXX CVE ids?
   (One for 1, 'edit' case, second for 2, 'save' case.) [Searching "Master Copy of CVE" for "mlmmj"
    keyword returned nothing for me.]

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
