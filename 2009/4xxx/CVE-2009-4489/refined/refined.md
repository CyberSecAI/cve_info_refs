      "is_related": true,
      "description": "Cherokee is vulnerable to log escape sequence injection. When the webserver is executed in foreground in a pty or when the logfiles are viewed with tools like \"cat\" or \"tail\" such control chars reach the terminal and are executed.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the web server's failure to sanitize terminal escape sequences within log files.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Log escape sequence injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject escape sequences into log files. When these logs are viewed in a terminal, the escape sequences can be interpreted and executed, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution or other terminal-based manipulations.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending specially crafted HTTP requests containing escape sequences"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability."
