Yes, it's a dupe. Sorry for the confusion.

Betreff: XSS Weakness in strip_tags
Antworten | Antwort an Autor | Weiterleiten | Drucken | Einzelne Nachricht | Original anzeigen | Diese Nachricht melden | Nachrichten dieses Autors suchen

There is a weakness in the strip_tags function in ruby on rails.  Due to
a bug in the parsing code inside HTML::Tokenizer regarding non-printable
ascii characters, an attacker can include values which certain browsers
will then evaluate.

Versions Affected:  All versions prior to 2.3.4 or 2.2.s
Not affected:       Applications which do not use strip_tags
Fixed Versions:     2.3.5

Impact
------

Applications relying on strip_tags for XSS protection may be vulnerable
to attacks on Internet Explorer users.

Releases
--------

The 2.3.5 releases is available at the normal locations now.

Workarounds
-----------

Users using strip_tags can pass the resulting output to the regular
escaping functionality:

  <%= h(strip_tag(...)) %>

Patches
-------

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided
patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format
and consist of a single changeset updating the parser and providing an
additional unit test.

* 2-2-strip_tags.patch - Patch for 2.2 series
* 2-3-strip_tags.patch - Patch for 2.3 series

Please note that only the  2.2.x and 2.3.x series are supported at
present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade
at their earliest convenience.

Credits
-------
Thanks to Gabe da Silveira for reporting the vulnerability to us and
providing the fix.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# XSS Weakness in strip\_tags

Due to

a bug in the parsing code inside HTML::Tokenizer regarding non-printable

ascii characters, an attacker can include values which certain browsers

will then evaluate.

Versions Affected: All versions prior to 2.3.4 or 2.2.s

Not affected: Applications which do not use strip\_tags

Fixed Versions: 2.3.5

Impact

------

Applications relying on strip\_tags for XSS protection may be vulnerable

to attacks on Internet Explorer users.

Releases

--------

The 2.3.5 releases is available at the normal locations now.

Workarounds

-----------

Users using strip\_tags can pass the resulting output to the regular

escaping functionality:

 <%= h(strip\_tag(...)) %>

Patches

-------

To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided

patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format

and consist of a single changeset updating the parser and providing an

additional unit test.

\* 2-2-strip\_tags.patch - Patch for 2.2 series

\* 2-3-strip\_tags.patch - Patch for 2.3 series

Please note that only the 2.2.x and 2.3.x series are supported at

present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade

at their earliest convenience.

Credits

-------

Thanks to Gabe da Silveira for reporting the vulnerability to us and

providing the fix.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with

CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2930 CVE-2011-2931 CVE-2011-3186 CVE-2009-4214

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web
application framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-4214

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
    strip_tags function. An attacker may inject non-printable characters
    that certain browsers will then evaluate. This vulnerability only
    affects the oldstable distribution (lenny).

CVE-2011-2930

    A SQL injection vulnerability had been found in the quote_table_name
    method could allow malicious users to inject arbitrary SQL into a
    query.

CVE-2011-2931

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
    strip_tags  helper. An parsing error can be exploited by an attacker,
    who can confuse the parser and may inject HTML tags into the output
    document.

CVE-2011-3186

    A newline (CRLF) injection vulnerability had been found in
    response.rb. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary
    HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via the
    Content-Type header.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-7+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.14.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
