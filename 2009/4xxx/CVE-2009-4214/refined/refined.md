  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A bug in the parsing code of HTML::Tokenizer within the strip_tags function in Ruby on Rails allows an attacker to inject non-printable ASCII characters that some browsers will evaluate as HTML tags.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
       "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Applications relying on `strip_tags` for XSS protection are vulnerable to attacks, particularly affecting Internet Explorer users.",
    "attack_vectors": "By including non-printable ASCII characters within HTML tags, an attacker can inject malicious scripts or HTML code that bypasses the intended sanitization.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to insert crafted input strings containing non-printable ASCII characters into a field that is processed by the `strip_tags` function."

  "affected_versions": {
    "ruby_on_rails": "All versions prior to 2.3.5 or 2.2.s",

  "fixes": {
     "fixed_versions": "2.3.5",
