Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4906:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the Acc PHP eMail application. Specifically, the application allows password change requests without proper validation or CSRF tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks due to the absence of CSRF tokens or other protections to ensure that requests to change the user's password are legitimately made by the user themselves.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can force a logged-in user to unknowingly change their password. This results in a complete loss of access to the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a crafted malicious website or email that contains HTML form that, when rendered in the user's browser, submits the crafted password change request to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting the crafted malicious website or opening a specially crafted email with the malicious form.
* The attacker does not need direct access to the server or the application itself.

**Summary of Exploit:**

The provided exploit HTML form demonstrates how to change the admin password by crafting an HTML form with hidden fields, targeting the vulnerable password change functionality, and tricking the logged-in user to submit the crafted form. This exploit effectively changes the password of the user without their knowledge or consent.
