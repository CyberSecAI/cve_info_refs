{
  "CVE-2009-4723": {
    "Description": "Netpet CMS 1.9 is vulnerable to local file inclusion via the 'language' parameter in confirm.php. The application directly includes the file specified in the 'language' parameter without proper sanitization, leading to the vulnerability.",
    "Root cause": "The application includes a file based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or executing malicious code if PHP code is included and processed.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a specific URL with a manipulated 'language' parameter, an attacker can force the application to include local files.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They also need knowledge of the file structure on the server to specify the path to the file they want to include. "
