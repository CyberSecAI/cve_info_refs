Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-4982:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `select()` function of the Irokez CMS.
*   Insufficient processing of user-supplied input passed to the `select()` function. This leads to the construction of a vulnerable SQL query. Specifically, the `$id` variable is directly inserted into the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `id` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize the input provided to the `select()` function which is then used in the SQL query.
*   **Magic Quotes Dependency:**  The exploitability depends on whether the `magic_quotes_gpc` PHP setting is turned off. If it is on, the exploit would not be easily executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries. This could include user credentials, personal information, or any other data stored in the database. In the provided example, an attacker extracts user login and password information from the `icm_users` table
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** The attacker might also modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, successful SQL injection can lead to complete control over the application and potentially the server depending on the application's level of permission to the database and server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
*   **Direct Injection into SQL Query:** User-supplied input (the `$id` variable) is directly incorporated into a database query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL to formulate effective SQL injection payloads.
*   **Vulnerability Awareness:** An attacker needs to know of the vulnerable `select()` function and the injection point.
*   **`magic_quotes_gpc` setting disabled:** The server hosting the CMS must have `magic_quotes_gpc` setting disabled for the exploit to function without more advanced payloads.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit example given is a `UNION SELECT` statement that is commonly used to retrieve data from different tables by a malicious user.
*   The provided code snippet shows the vulnerable code in the `select()` function and is very helpful in understanding the vulnerability.
*   The exploit provided shows how to obtain the login and password from the table `icm_users`.
