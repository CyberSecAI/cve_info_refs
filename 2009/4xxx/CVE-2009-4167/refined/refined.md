**Vulnerabilities Summary:**

This security advisory details multiple vulnerabilities found in several third-party TYPO3 extensions. These vulnerabilities include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Information Disclosure, TYPO3 Cache Spoofing, SQL Injection, and Local Command Execution.

**Specific Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Extension: `[AN] Search it! (an_searchit)`**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   **Affected Versions:** 2.4.1 and below
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *  **Root cause:**  Improper sanitization of user input.
    *   **Resolution:** Extension removed from TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER). Users are advised to uninstall and remove the extension.

2.  **Extension: `Simple download-system with counter and categories (kk_downloader)`**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Information Disclosure
    *   **Affected Versions:** 1.2.1 and below
    *   **Impact:** Potential exposure of sensitive data.
    *   **Root cause:**  Unspecified, but likely insecure handling of data access or permissions.
    *   **Resolution:** Updated to version 1.2.2.

3.  **Extension: `Automatic Base Tags for RealUrl (lt_basetag)`**
    *   **Vulnerability:** TYPO3 Cache Spoofing
    *   **Affected Versions:** 1.0.0
    *    **Impact:** Could allow an attacker to manipulate the base URL, potentially leading to redirects to malicious sites or other cache-related exploits.
    *   **Root cause:** Improper manipulation of the base URL within the TYPO3 caching mechanism.
    *   **Resolution:** Extension removed from TER. Users advised to use TypoScript with conditions to set base URL.

4.  **Extension: `Trips (mchtrips)`**
    *   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
    *   **Affected Versions:** 2.0.0
    *  **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into the database.
    *   **Root cause:**  Improperly sanitized user-provided input used in SQL queries.
    *   **Resolution:** Updated to version 2.0.1.

5.  **Extension: `simple Glossar (simple_glossar)`**
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection
    *   **Affected Versions:** 1.0.3 and below
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts and/or manipulate the database.
    *   **Root cause:** Improper input sanitization leading to both XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Resolution:** Extension removed from TER. Users advised to uninstall and remove the extension.

6.  **Extension: `TW Productfinder (tw_productfinder)`**
    *   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
    *   **Affected Versions:** 0.0.2 and below
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into the database.
    *   **Root cause:**  Improperly sanitized user input in SQL queries.
    *   **Resolution:** Extension removed from TER. Users are advised to uninstall and remove the extension.

7.  **Extension: `DB Integration (wfqbe)`**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Local Command Execution
    *   **Affected Versions:** 1.3.1 and below
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Root cause:** Likely due to the use of unsanitized input in system calls or shell commands.
    *   **Resolution:** Updated to version 1.3.2 (and later 1.3.4).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Through malicious input embedded in URLs, forms, or other user-provided data.
*   **SQL Injection:** Through crafted input parameters that are used in database queries without proper sanitization.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Through vulnerabilities in how the application handles or restricts access to data.
*   **TYPO3 Cache Spoofing:** By manipulating parameters used to generate or retrieve cached content.
*   **Local Command Execution:** Through crafted input that's improperly handled by system or shell execution functions on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   Ability to interact with the web application via HTTP requests.
*   For SQL Injection: knowledge of the application's database schema may help, but is not always required.
*   For Command Execution: In-depth understanding of server-side command execution flows.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory emphasizes that these are third-party extensions and not part of the TYPO3 core.
*   The advisory recommends subscribing to the `typo3-announce` mailing list for future security bulletins.
*  It also refers to the TYPO3 Security Cookbook for best practices.
