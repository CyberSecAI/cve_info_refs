Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4966:

**Verification:**
The provided content directly relates to CVE-2009-4966, as it details a security advisory (TYPO3-SA-2009-013) which includes multiple vulnerabilities in third-party TYPO3 extensions, which is consistent with the CVE description.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerabilities is SQL injection within several different third-party TYPO3 extensions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Specifically, some of the extensions were vulnerable to "Blind SQL Injection".
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
    *   Potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   Modify or extract sensitive data.
    *   Possibly compromise the entire web application, depending on the database permissions and the nature of the queries executed.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable parameters and user inputs that are not properly sanitized or validated in the affected TYPO3 extensions. This could be achieved by submitting malicious crafted queries via web requests to the vulnerable extension features.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to send web requests to a TYPO3 instance with any of the vulnerable extensions installed. No prior access to the server would be required, they would just have to be able to reach the web server.

**Affected Extensions and Versions:**

The advisory lists the following vulnerable extensions and affected versions:

*   **AIRware Lexicon (air\_lexicon):** Version 0.0.1
*   **AST ZipCodeSearch (ast\_addresszipsearch):** Version 0.5.4
*   **Car (car):** Version 0.1.0 and all versions below
*   **Event Registration (event\_registr):** Version 1.0.0 and all versions below
*   **Solidbase Bannermanagement (SBbanner):** Version 1.0.1
*   **t3m\_affiliate (t3m\_affiliate):** Version 0.5.0
*   **AJAX Chat (vjchat):** Version 0.3.2 and all versions below

**Remediation:**

*   **AIRware Lexicon, AST ZipCodeSearch, Event Registration, Solidbase Bannermanagement, and t3m\_affiliate:** The recommendation is to uninstall these extensions and delete all associated files as no fixes are available.
*   **Car and AJAX Chat:** Updates are available. Users should update to version 0.1.1 for "car" and version 0.3.3 for "vjchat."

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory clearly indicates that the vulnerabilities affect *third-party* extensions, not the TYPO3 core itself.
* The advisory also mentions that the vulnerable extensions have been removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository, making them no longer available for download.
* This advisory is a "Collective Security Bulletin" (CSB), which is used for less critical vulnerabilities in third-party extensions, in order to reduce workload of the security team.
