Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the Joomla! Component FacileForms. Specifically, the `Itemid` parameter in the URL is not being filtered, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code into the webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Cookie theft: Successful exploitation can lead to the theft of administrator and user cookies, which could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user accounts or administrative control of the Joomla site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- URL parameter injection: The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious code into the `Itemid` parameter of the URL.
  - Example: `http://server/index.php?option=com_facileforms&Itemid=[XSS CODE]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- No special privileges are needed to inject the payload.
