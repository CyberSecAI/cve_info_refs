Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2009-4545:

**Vulnerability 1: File Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The application directly exposes the `globepersonnel.mdb` database file through a direct URL.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Information Exposure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can directly access and download the database file, potentially containing sensitive information.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Direct access via web browser by navigating to `http://www.logoshows.com/bbs/database/globepersonnel.mdb`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No special capabilities required, the attacker simply needs network access to the vulnerable server.

**Vulnerability 2: Insecure Cookie Handling**

*   **Root Cause:** The application relies on client-side cookies for authentication and authorization, specifically the `pb_username` and `level` cookies.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Insecure Authentication and Authorization. The application doesn't properly validate the cookies set by the user, and trusts that user supplied values to determine the user permissions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   By setting the `pb_username` cookie to `admin`, an attacker can potentially bypass authentication.
    *   By setting the `level` cookie to `3`, an attacker can potentially gain administrative privileges.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By using JavaScript or browser extensions to set cookies via `document.cookie = "pb%5Fusername=admin; path=/";` and `document.cookie = "level=3; path=/";` before visiting `http://www.logoshows.com/bbs/globepersonnel_reply.asp?id=6&topic=6&recordnum=0`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker requires the ability to execute client-side JavaScript, typically in their own browser.
