Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4927

**Vulnerable Software:** WB News 2.1.2

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Insecure cookie handling. The application does not properly secure or validate the cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application uses a cookie named `WBNEWS` for what appears to be session management. The cookie's value is not validated or secured properly, which allows an attacker to arbitrarily set it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By setting the `WBNEWS` cookie to a valid ID (e.g., "1"), an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel of WB News.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Client-Side Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the cookie using Javascript, setting the `WBNEWS` cookie to a desired value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute Javascript in the context of the victim's browser session when accessing the vulnerable site. This could be achieved via the browser's Javascript console or by injecting it into a page.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit code demonstrates setting the `WBNEWS` cookie using Javascript:
```javascript
javascript:document.cookie="WBNEWS=[id];path=/";
```
This allows the attacker to arbitrarily set the cookie value and gain administrative access without proper authentication.

The example provided within the exploit details setting `WBNEWS=1;path=/;` to bypass the login and access the administrative panel.
