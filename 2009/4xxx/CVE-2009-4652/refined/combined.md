 -- ChangeLog --
ngIRCd 27 (2024-04-26)
 - Update ChangeLog, NEWS, AUTHORS.md & doc/Platforms.txt for ngIRCd 27. - Clarify in the sample configuration file and the ngircd.conf(5) manual page that the "CAFile" option is unset by default. - Fix channel symbol returned in the RPL\_NAMREPLY(353) numeric of NAMES commands for secret (mode +s) channels: this should be "@", not "=". Thanks Val Lorentz <progval+git@progval.net> for the patch! Closes #313. - Add an example filter file for "Fail2Ban": contrib/ngircd-fail2ban.conf. - Don't abort startup when setgid/setuid() fails with EINVAL: Both setgid(2) as well as setuid(2) can fail with EINVAL in addition to EPERM, their manual pages state "EINVAL: The user/group ID specified in uid/gid is not valid in this user namespace ". So not only treat EPERM as an "acceptable error" and continue with logging the error, but do the same for EINVAL. This was triggered by the Void Linux xbps-uunshare(1) tool used for building "XBPS source packages" and reported by luca in #ngircd. Thanks! - Test suite: Don't use "pgrep -u" when LOGNAME and USER are not set Thanks for reporting this on IRC, luca!
 ngIRCd 27~rc1 (2024-04-13) - Validate certificates on server links. Up to now, ngIRCd optionally used SSL/TLS encrypted server-server links but never checked and validated any certificates. Now ngIRCd validates SSL/TLS certificates on outgoing server-server links by default and drops(!) connections when the remote certificate is invalid (for example self-signed, expired, not matching the host name, ...). Therefore you have to make sure that all relevant \*certificates are valid\* (or to disable certificate validation on this connection using the new `SSLVerify = false` setting in the affected `[Server]` block, where the remote certificate is not valid and you can not fix this issue). The original patch for OpenSSL dates back to 2009 and was written by Florian Westphal and was extended for GnuTLS in 2014 by Christoph Biedl. But it took us another 10 years to bring it to life ... oh my! Many thanks to both Florian and Christoph! Closes #120. - Add support for the "sd\_notify" protocol of systemd(8): Periodically "ping" the service manager (every 3 seconds) and set a status message showing current connection statistics which then is included in "systemctl status ngircd.service" output. In addition, this enables using the systemd(8) watchdog functionality ("WatchdogSec") for the "ngircd.service" unit and allows it to use the "notify" service type, which results in better status tracking by the service manager. - Try to set file descriptor limit to its maximum and show info on startup: The number of possible parallel connections is limited by the file descriptor limit of the process (among other things). Therefore try to upgrade the current "soft" limit to its "hard" maximum (but limited to 100000 instead of "infinite"), and show an information or even warning when the limit is still less than the configured "MaxConnections" setting. Please note that ngIRCd and its linked libraries (like PAM) need file descriptors not only for incoming and outgoing IRC connections, but for reading files and inter-process communication, too! Therefore the actual connection limit is less(!) than the file descriptor limit! - Update and fix the logcheck(8) rules file. - METADATA: Fix unsetting the "cloakhost" hostname, which did not result in the original hostname being restored, but actually resulted in an empty string being used as the client hostname -- which is a protocol violation. - Update the "rpm" make target to use the rpmbuild(8) command. - Add a "Docker file" (contrib/Dockerfile) and corresponding documentation (doc/Container.md) to the project. The resulting container is based on the latest Debian "stable-slim" container and built using a "build container". - Remove outdated, unsupported and broken support for splint(1). - Don't show the default config file name on config errors: The configuration can be set in drop-in files in the include directory, too, so it is not clear in which file it is actually missing. - No longer use a default built-in value for the "IncludeDir" directive when a configuration file was explicitly specified on the command line using "--config"/"-f": This way no default include directory is scanned when a possibly non-default configuration file is used which (intentionally) did not specify an "IncludeDir" directive. So now you can use "-f /dev/null" for checking all built-in defaults, regardless of any local configuration files in the default drop-in directory (which would have been read in until this change). - No longer log channel keys ("passwords") for predefined channels. - The server "Name" in the "[Global]" section of the configuration file no longer needs to be set: When not set (or empty), ngIRCd now tries to deduce a valid IRC server name from the local host name ("node name"), possibly adding a ".host" extension when the host name does not contain a dot (".") which is required in an IRC server name ("ID"). This new behavior, with all configuration parameters now being optional, allows running ngIRCd without any configuration file at all. - Silence some compiler warnings. - autogen.sh: Prefer automake 1.11 over other releases because this is the last release supporting "de-ANSI-fication" using the included ansi2knr tool. And because we \_want\_ to support old K&R platforms, we try hard to use this release of automake when available to generate our build system. Note: This is only relevant for you if you are building from Git sources. - Autodetect support for IPv6 by default: Until now, IPv6 support was disabled by default, which seems a bit outdated in 2024. Note: You still can pass "--enable-ipv6"/"--disable-ipv6" to the ./configure script to forcefully activate or deactivate IPv6 support. - Do IDENT requests even when DNS lookups are disabled: Up to now disabling DNS in the configuration disabled IDENT lookups as well (for no good reason). Now you can activate/deactivate DNS lookups and IDENT requests completely separately. Thanks for reporting this, Miniontoby! Closes #291. - Update config.guess (2023-08-22) and config.sub (2023-09-19) files. - Fix Channel Admins being able to to set Channel Owner status! "Sarah" reported this back in April 2021 and proposed a patch, thanks a lot! - Test suite: Update for OpenSSL 3.x, some command outputs changed, clean up shell scripts and make the getpid.sh script more robust. - Allow SSL client-only configurations without keys/certificates: You don't need to configure certificates/keys as long as you don't configure SSL-enabled listening ports. This can make sense when you want to only link your local daemon to an uplink server using SSL and only have clients on your local host or in your fully trusted network, where SSL is not required. - Remove the unmaintained contrib/MacOSX/ folder: this includes the Xcode project as well as the outdated macOS "Package Maker" configuration. The sample launchd(8) configuration properties list file was moved to "contrib/de.barton.ngircd.plist" and kept. - Fix showing the "Ident" option in "--configtest" output which was never shown because of a coding error. Whoops! - Change GnuTLS "slot handling" messages to debug level: Those messages are about an internal implementation detail, not relevant for an administrator of ngIRCd. - Enlarge buffer for log messages: For example, SSL/TLS certificate information can easily get longer than 256 characters. So enlarge the log buffer to 1 KB to avoid cutting off relevant information. - Respect "SSLConnect" option for incoming connections and do not accept incoming plain-text ("non SSL") server connections for servers configured with "SSLConnect" enabled. This change prevents an authenticated client-server being able to force the server-server to send its password on a plain-text connection when SSL/TLS was intended. - Always try to close a connection with errors immediately, but try hard to avoid too much recursion. Without this patch, an outgoing server connection could get stuck in an "endless" state trying to write out data over and over again. - Add "hopm.service" to "Wants" and "Before" dependencies in the sample systemd unit file (Hopm is the successor of Bopm). - Update Debian package configuration using current "dh\_make", package dependencies and build rules. And no longer build 3 different versions, only build "ngircd" which now includes support for IDENT, PAM (disabled in the ngircd.conf installed by the package), SSL (OpenSSL), ZLib and IPv6. - Return ERR\_NOTEXTTOSEND on empty PRIVMSG content, which matches the behavior of other servers. - Add a new option "Autojoin" to [Channel] blocks: When it is set, ngIRCd automatically joins all local users to this channel on connect. Note: The users must have permissions to access the channel, otherwise joining them will fail! Thanks Ivan Agarkov <i\_agarkov@wargaming.net> for the initial patch! - Hide invisible (+i) users on "WHOIS <pattern>": Let's behave like most(?) other IRC daemons (at least ircd2.11) and hide all +i users when WHOIS is used with a pattern. Otherwise privacy of this users is not guaranteed and the +i mode a bit useless ... Reported by Cahata on #ngircd, thanks! - Update the final "closing connection" message: Add some more information like nick name, user name, host name and bring it in line with some other implementations (at least ircd2.11 and Hybrid). - Fix RPL\_INVITING message: All numeric replies must originate from an IRC server, never from a client. Thanks "tommyrot" for reporting this! Closes #307. - Enhance some log messages, for example for errors when accepting new connections. - Make the debug log level ("--debug"/-"d" command line option) always available, not only when ./configure'd with "--enable-debug": the latter now only enables additional checks (like the tests done using assert(2)) and is signalled by adding "+DEBUG" to the version "feature string". This change enables everyone to get even more detailed logging when required. - Always report an error when a parameter is missing in a channel "MODE +k" or "MODE +l" command, and better validate their parameters: return the new numeric ERR\_INVALIDMODEPARAM\_MSG(696) on errors. Thanks Val Lorentz for reporting this! Closes #290. - Allow IRC Operators to use the WHO command on any channel. - Add configuration for "ngIRCd CI" GitHub Action, no longer use Travis-CI. - Send the NAMES list and channel topic to users "forcefully" joined to a channel using NJOIN, like they joined on their own using JOIN, and streamline the order of NAMES list and channel topic messages. Closes #288. - Fix (invalid) error messages when setting modes on local channels which are defined in the configuration file. - Fix handling of G-Lines/K-Lines with cloaked host names. - Streamline logging of debug messages. - Added a new command line option "-y"/"--syslog", with which logging to syslog can be activated/deactivated separately from running on the console (using "--nodaemon") or in the background. Thanks Katherine Peeters for the patch and pull request! Closes #294. - Fix a possible race condition while introducing new clients in the network. - Update, enhance and extend our documentation in README.md, INSTALL.md, doc/HowToRelease.txt and the manual pages ngircd(8) and ngircd.conf(5), add a new doc/QuickStart.md document, and convert some more documentation files to Markdown (AUTHORS.md, contrib/README.md, doc/FAQ.md, doc/SSL.md).
ngIRCd 26.1 (2021-01-02)
 - Fix a "format string" compiler warning (detected on OpenBSD). - No longer set "AI\_ADDRCONFIG" when resolving host names, even when it exists: with this option set, on an IPv6-only host, we prevent 127.0.0.1 to get translated properly, even when the loopback interface has this address configured! And as the test suite uses 127.0.0.1, it was broken on IPv6-only hosts. The drawback is that the resolver possibly returns more addresses now, even of an unsupported/not connected address family; but this shouldn't do much harm in practice, as ngIRCd iterates over all returned addresses while trying to establish an outgoing connection. Closes #281. - Revert "Show allowed channel types in ISUPPORT(005) numeric only", which was introduced in 26~rc1: This lead to some IRC clients assuming "oh, no channel prefix characters at all, so no channels at all, so no PRIVMSG can go to any channel" when "AllowedChannelTypes" was set to the empty string ("") -- which is not the case when there are pre-defined channel set up or other servers still having channels! So "allowed channel types" != "supported channel types", and we always have to list all supported ones in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric! Closes #285. - Test suite: Wait 2 seconds after reloading the daemon, which is required because on reload, all listening ports are closed, configuration updated, and then opened again. This lead to subsequent tests running while the daemon isn't listening on any ports, and that's why some tests could fail. Closes #280. - platformtest.sh: Try to mangle CLang name more intelligently. - Documentation: Fixed URLs of Atheme IRC services, updated all mentions from CVS to Git, and updated Platforms.txt -- Oh, and it is 2021 now! ;-)
ngIRCd 26 (2020-06-20)
 ngIRCd 26~rc2 (2020-06-11) - Add AppStream metadata file (contrib/de.barton.ngircd.metainfo.xml). - Don't send invalid CHANINFO commands when a channel has mode +k set but no key is known to the server. This can happen with a misconfigured predefined channel, for example, and looked like this: "CHANINFO #test +Pk 0 :" -- note the unset key represented by the two spaces. Fix this by sending a "\*" in this case and update the CHANINFO documentation, too. - ngircd.spec: Fix names of README.md and INSTALL.md, add ".md" extension. - Update description texts in the README.md file, the RPM and Debian package files and the manual page: bring them in line with the updated homepage. - Server-Server protocol: Fix use-after-free when unregistering a directly connected server sending a SQUIT for itself. - Server-Server protocol: Detect bogus SERVER commands lacking a prefix. Thanks Hilko Bengen (hillu) for finding & reporting this as well for the patch & pull request (even if fixed differently). Closes #275. - Fix the PING-PONG logic: In ngIRCd 26~rc1 this was completely broken (while trying to fix timeouts during server handshakes in bigger networks): the daemon never disconnected any stale peers but kept sending out PINGs over and over again ... - Test suite: Add missing files needed to test SSL support to "EXTRA\_DIST", so that they are included in distribution archives: in rc1, "make check" fails when using sources from an archive and enabling SSL support. Thanks to Hilko Bengen <bengen@hilluzination.de> for the patch!
 ngIRCd 26~rc1 (2020-05-10) - Tweak & update doc/HowToRelease.txt, .mailmap and AUTHORS files. - Allow up to 512 characters per line in MOTD and help text files (but keep in mind that lines can't get that long, because they have to be prefixed before being sent to the client). But this allows for more fancy MOTDs :-) Closes #271. - Show the actually allowed channel types in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric which are configured by the "AllowedChannelTypes" configuration variable. Closes #273. - Handle commands in the read buffer before reading more data and don't wait for the network in this case: If there are more bytes in the read buffer already than a single valid IRC command can get long (513 bytes), wait for this/those command(s) to be handled first and don't try to read even more data from the network (which most probably would overflow the read buffer of this connection soon). - Update Travis-CI configuration, "sudo" is deprecated. - Log G-/K-Line changes only when not initiated by a server: this prevents the log from becoming spammed during "net bursts". - Update test suite to include SSL tests, including checking for reloading certificates during runtime. - Makefile.am: Replace "make" with "${MAKE}". This fixes warnings like this: "warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1. Add `+' to parent make rule." Thanks to Sam James (sam\_c) <sam@cmpct.info>! Closes #270. - Add support for GnuTLS certificate reload, which is quite handy when using Let's Encrypt, for example. Until now this was only supported when linked with OpenSSL. Thanks a lot, Hilko Bengen <bengen@hilluzination.de>! - Remove deprecated legacy configuration options and related functions that have been marked for removal for quite some time: - PredefChannelsOnly (v22) - NoticeAuth (v24) - NoXXX (v19) - Old '[GLOBAL]' section handling (v19) Thanks to Michi <michi+ngircd@dataswamp.org> for the patch! - Fix recursion bug on write errors: Depending on the stack size, too many clients on the same channel quitting at the same time would trigger a crash due to too many recursive calls to Conn\_Close(). Thanks to Michi <michi+ngircd@dataswamp.org> for the patch! - Fix builds using GCC option -fno-common, which is the default starting with GCC 10. Thanks to Michi <michi+ngircd@dataswamp.org> for the patch! Closes #266. - Convert INSTALL and README files to Markdown. - Allow setting arbitrary channel modes in the configuration file by handling them like in MODE commands, and allow multiple "Modes =" lines per [Channel] section. Thanks to Michi <michi+ngircd@dataswamp.org>! Closes #55. - Add "FNC" (forced nick changes) to ISUPPORT(005) numeric. Most probably this doesn't make any difference to any client, but it seems correct. See <http://www.irc.org/tech\_docs/005.html> for details. - Reuse old SSL key if loading a new one failed. - Remove outdated OpenBSD/NetBSD systrace.policy. - Enhance handling of command line errors, and return with exit code 0 ("no error") when "--help" or "--version" is used (which resulted in exit code 1, "error" before). Exit with code 2 ("command line error") for all other invalid command line options, and show the error message itself on stderr (instead of stdout and exit code 1, "generic error", as before). This new behavior is more in line with the GNU "coding standards", see <https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html\_node/\_002d\_002dhelp.html>. - Fix and update Xcode project: Reference correct contrib/Makefile.am file, correctly sort contrib/nglog.sh and add "ORGANIZATIONNAME" setting. - contrib/ngindent.sh: Add more GNU indent options for better results, and add the ".sh" suffix to bring this script in line with the others in the contrib/ folder. - Add ./contrib/nglog.sh: This script parses the log output of ngircd(8), and colorizes the messages according to their log level. Example usage: ngircd -f $PWD/doc/sample-ngircd.conf -np | ./contrib/nglog.sh - Log received signals with their names using strsignal(3), when available. - Make test suite compatible with Haiku OS. - Fix host mask cloaking bug, don't cloak multiple times: Previously, each server would cloak every user's host mask. The problem is that if a network has more than one server, then a user's host mask would get cloaked twice. This patch ensures that a server only cloaks the host mask if it has not yet been cloaked (the period indicates it's still an IP address). Thanks to JRMU <jrmu@lecturify.com> for the patch! Closes #228. - Enlarge buffers of info texts to 128 bytes. This includes: - "Real name" of a client (4th filed of the USER command). - Server info text ("Info" configuration option). - Admin info texts and email address ("AdminInfo1", "AdminInfo2" and "AdminEmail" configuration options). - Network name ("Network" configuration option). The limit was 64 bytes before ... Closes #258. - Streamline handling of invalid and unset server name: Don't exit during runtime (REHASH command, HUP signal), because the server name can't be changed in this case anyway and the new invalid name will be ignored. - Fix and extend documentation: Fix some typos, fix syntax of LINKS and LIST commands, whitespace and spelling fixes, update dependencies and add some more information about IRCv3 support. Thanks to Thanks Windree, Étienne Mollier <etienne.mollier@mailoo.org> and Christoph Biedl <debian.axhn@manchmal.in-ulm.de>. Closes #264. - Slightly reorder startup steps, and enhance logging: - Show name of configuration file at the beginning of start up. - Add a message when ngIRCd is ready, including its host name. - Show name of configuration file on REHASH (SIGHUP), too. - Change level of "done message" to NOTICE, like "starting" & "ready". - Initialize IO functions before channels, connections, clients, ... - configure.ng: OpenSSL can depends on lz or latomic so use pkg-config to find those dependencies and fallback to existing mechanism. Closes #256. - ngircd.conf.5: Fix wording as suggested by lintian.
ngIRCd 25 (2019-01-23)
 - Fix documentation of MotdPhrase length, which actually is 126 characters: update sample configuration file as well as the man page. Thanks to shankari <shankari@eecs.berkeley.edu>. Closes #254. - Implement new configuration option "MaxPenaltyTime", which configures the maximum penalty time increase in seconds, per penalty event. Set to -1 for no limit (the default), 0 to disable penalties altogether. ngIRCd doesn't use penalty increases higher than 2 seconds during normal operation, so values higher than 1 rarely make sense. Disabling (or reducing) penalties can greatly speed up "make check" runs for example, see below, but are mostly a debugging feature and normally not meant to be used on production systems! Some example timings running "make check" from my macOS workstation: - MaxPenaltyTime not set: 4:41,79s - "MaxPenaltyTime = 1": 3:14,71s - "MaxPenaltyTime = 0": 25,46s Closes #249 and #251. - Fix compilation without deprecated OpenSSL APIs. Thanks to Rosen Penev <rosenp@gmail.com> for the patch! Closes #252. - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (10.0) - Fix some compiler warnings of Apple Xcode/Clang - Allow a 5th parameter in WEBIRC. Thanks to "ItsOnlyBinary". Closes #247. - Update some more documentation files and source code comments. - Platforms.txt: Add and update systems.
 ngIRCd 25~rc1 (2018-08-11) - Update config.guess (2018-03-08) and config.sub (2018-03-08) files. - Correctly retry to establish an outgoing connections when forking of the resolver sub-process failed (for example because of lack of free memory). Until now, such a connection was never retried once this error was hit. Thanks to Robert Obermeier for reporting this bug! Closes #243. - Fix a "use after free" bug which can be triggered on a newly established connection when the daemon handles an ERROR command received from the peer during client login. Thanks a lot to Joseph Bisch <joseph.bisch@gmail.com> for discovering and reporting this issue! - Only send TOPIC updates to a channel when the topic actually changed: This prevents the channel from becoming flooded by unnecessary TOPIC update messages, that can happen when IRC services try to enforce a certain topic but which is already set (at least on the local server), for example. Therefore still forward it to all servers, but don't inform local clients (still update setter and timestamp information, though). - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (9.2). This includes adding missing and deleting obsolete file references. - Handle user mode "C" ("Only users that share a channel are allowed to send messages") like user mode "b" ("block private messages and notices"): allow messages from servers, services, and IRC Operators, too. Change proposed by "wowaname" back in 2015 in #ngircd, thanks! - Fix some compiler warnings. - Add contrib/ngircd.logcheck: Some sample logcheck(8) rules. - Allow IRC Ops and remote servers to KILL service clients: such clients behave like regular users, therefore IRC operators and servers should be able to KILL them: for example to resolve nick collisions. Closes #242. - Don't forward KILLs to other servers if they've been blocked locally: This prevents clients from killing IRC services, for example. Closes #238 and #239. - Fix a cross-compiler issue related to the Get\_Error() function. Closes #240 and #241. - Update ./doc/Services.txt, enhance configuration examples.
ngIRCd 24 (2017-01-20)
 - Make sure that ./contrib/platformtest.sh aborts when ./autogen.sh fails. - Update config.guess (2016-10-02) and config.sub (2016-11-04) files. - Build Debian packages with OpenSSL instead of GnuTLS: OpenSSL allows to reload used certificates on runtime for example (which is very useful when using Let's Encrypt), and therefore is preferred. And explicitly specify the "source format". - Fix handling of connection pool allocation and enlargement: up to now, the daemon only enlarged its connection pool when accepting new incoming client or server connections, not when establishing new outgoing server links, which could lead to problems when hitting the configured limit, see "MaxConnections". Thanks to Lukas Braun (k00mi) for reporting this! Closes #231.
 ngIRCd 24~rc1 (2017-01-07) - Enhance systemd service file, and install it in Debian package. - Update configuration of Debian package. - Log privilege violations and failed OPER request with log level "error" and send it to the "&SERVER" channel, too. - Immediately shut down connection when receiving an "ERROR" command, don't wait for the peer to close the connection. This allows the daemon to forward the received "ERROR" message in the network, instead of the very generic "client closed connection" message. - Fix sending of entry duration (no negative values!) when synchronizing "x-lines" (G-LINES). - List expiration (G-LINES): use same log level as when setting, and log this event to the &SERVER channel, too. - Explicitly forbid remote servers to modify "x-lines" (G-LINES) when the "AllowRemoteOper" configuration option isn't set, even when the command seems to originate from the remote server itself: this prevents GLINE's to become set during server handshake in this case (what wouldn't be possible during regular runtime when a remote IRC Op sends the command) and what can't be undone by IRC Ops later on (because of the missing "AllowRemoteOper" option) ... - Make scripts and init-files in ./contrib executable. - Fix building ngIRCd with OpenSSL 1.1. Thanks to Christoph Biedl <ngircd.anoy@manchmal.in-ulm.de> for the patch! - Fix code indentation warnings of gcc 6.2. - Update config.guess (2016-04-02) and config.sub (2016-03-30) files. - Fix warnings of the "shellcheck" linter in autogen.sh, contrib/ngindent and contrib/platformtest.sh. - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (8.0), and fix "duplicate symbols" error messages when building (linking) the binary. - Add "Documentation" variables to systemd configuration files. - Make sure that SYSCONFDIR is always set, which can be handy when using source code linters when ./configure hasn't been run already. - Add the new "PAMServiceName" configuration option to specify the name used as PAM service name. This setting allows to run multiple ngIRCd instances with different PAM configurations for each instance. Thanks to Christian Aistleitner <christian@quelltextlich.at> for the patch, closes #226. - Add an ".editorconfig" file to the project. - Travis-CI: use "container-based infrastructure". - Limit the number of message targets, and suppress duplicates: This prevents an user from flooding the server using commands like this: "PRIVMSG nick1,nick1,nick1,...". Duplicate targets are suppressed silently (channels and clients). In addition, the maximum number of targets per PRIVMSG, NOTICE, ... command are limited to MAX\_HNDL\_TARGETS (25). If there are more, the daemon sends the new 407 (ERR\_TOOMANYTARGETS\_MSG) numeric, containing the first target that hasn't been handled any more. Closes #187. - Test suite: Add new test for server-server logins. - contrib/ngindent: Fix shebang line. - Make contrib/platformtest.sh script more portable, and only show "runs=Y" when the test suite really has been passed successfully. - Code cleanup in the NJOIN handler and the function killing clients as well as the function sending messages to a "mask" (cleaner code, more fault tolerant, better code comments). - Update and enhance documentation: README file, doc/Platforms.txt, doc/Modes.txt, doc/Commands.txt, doc/PAM.txt. - Fix NJOIN not propagating "half ops" status: ngIRCd tested for the wrong prefix of "half ops" when processing NJOIN commands and therefore never classified a remote user as "half op". Thanks to wowaname for pointing this out on #ngircd!
ngIRCd 23 (2015-11-16)
 - Explicitly cast time\_t to long when printing it out: this prevents wrong sized data types on platforms where time\_t doesn't equal a long any more, for example on OpenBSD (which would result in garbled output on those platforms). - contrib/Debian/changelog: Fix email address. - Documentation: Spelling fixes; update doc/Platforms.txt.
 ngIRCd 23~rc1 (2015-09-06) - Add ".clang\_complete" file, which is used by the "linter-clang" package of the Atom editor, for example. - Make server-to-server protocol more robust: ngIRCd now catches more errors on the server-to-server (S2S) protocol that could crash the daemon before. This hasn't been a real problem because the IRC S2S protocol is "trusted" by design, but the behavior is much better now. Thanks to wowaname on #ngircd for pointing this out! - Make platformtest.sh, autogen.sh, and ngircd.init more portable. - Enables "reproducible builds" for ngIRCd: Use the optional BIRTHTIME constant while building ngIRCd, which contains a time stamp for the "Birth Date" information, in seconds since the epoch. See <https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds>. - Update "contrib/ngircd.service" file for systemd. - INSTALL: Add deprecation notice for "PredefChannelsOnly" variable. - Use "NOTICE \*" before registration instead of "NOTICE AUTH". "AUTH" is a valid nickname so sending notices to it is probably not a good idea. Use "\*" as the target instead as done with numerics when the nick is not available. This mimics the behavior in Charybdis, IRCD-Hybrid, InspIRCd 2.2, Plexus 4, etc. Closes #217. The "NoticeAuth" configuration variable (ngircd.conf) has been renamed to "NoticeBeforeRegistration" accordingly, but the old name is still supported for compatibility reasons. - Implement new channel mode "N" (regular users can't change their nick name while on this channel). Closes #214. - README, AUTHORS: Update mailing list and issue tracker URLs. - Remove doc/GIT.txt (it is outdated), update doc/Contributing.txt: ngIRCd uses GitHub, and Git itself is quite common today. So don't include an own Git "mini HowTo" any longer. - Specify session context for OpenSSL clients. This enables some OpenSSL clients, including Pidgin and stunnel 5.06, to reuse a session. Patch by Tom Ryder <tom@sanctum.geek.nz>, thanks! Closes #182. - Keep track of who placed bans, invites, and excepts. Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #203. - Make setgroups(3) function optional: For example, Interix is missing this function, which prevented ngIRCd to build on this platform. When setgroups(3) isn't available, a warning message is issued on startup. - Implement numeric RPL\_LISTSTART(321). lightIRC and other clients expecting RPL\_LISTSTART should now behave correctly. Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #207. - Update ngircd.conf.5: "CloakUserToNick" hides user \_and\_ real name. This closes #208. - Fix case insensitive pattern matching: Up to now, only the input string became lowercased and was then compared to the pattern -- which failed when the pattern itself wasn't all lowercase! - Streamline the effect of "MorePrivacy" option: Update documentation in ngircd.conf(5); don't hide channels for IRC Ops on LIST and don't hide IP addresses/hostnames on WHOIS when "MorePrivacy" is in effect. This closes #198. - IRC operators now can kick anyone when "OperCanMode" is set. Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #202. - Implement user mode "I": Hide channels on WHOIS: this mode prevents ngIRCd from showing channels on WHOIS (IRC Operators can always see the channel list). Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #197. - INVITE command: Implement ERR\_USERNOTONSERV(504) numeric and make sure that the target user is on the same server when inviting other users to local ("&") channels. Idea by Cahata, thanks! Closes #183. - INVITE command: Enforce 1 second penalty time, which prevents flooding of the target client. This closes #186. Reported by Cahata, thanks! - MODE command: Always report channel creation time. Up to now when receiving a MODE command, ngIRCd only reported the channel creation time to clients that were members of the channel. This patch reports the channel creation time to all clients, regardless if they are joined to that channel or not. At least ircd-seven behaves like this. This closes #188. Reported by Cahata, thanks! - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (6.3).
ngIRCd 22.1 (2015-04-06)
 - Update doc/Platforms.txt and doc/FAQ.txt. - Fix spelling of RPL\_WHOISBOT message text. - Don't send nick name as default PART reason: No other IRC daemon seems to do this (today?). Closes #185. Reported by Cahata in #ngircd, thanks! - Fix "WHO #<chan>" showing invisible users and hiding all visible, the logic was reversed! This bug has been introduced by commit c74115f2, "Simplify mode checking on channels and users within a channel", ngIRCd releases 21, 21.1, and 22 are affected :-( Problem reported by Cahata in #ngircd, Thanks! - Fix typo in src/testsuite/README - Auth PING: Fix our information text for manual sending of "PONG". Up to now, ngIRCd doesn't send a valid IRC command at all, oops! - Auth PING: Fix internal time stamp conversion and don't send a prefix in our PING command. The prefix confuses WeeChat, at least, which doesn't send an appropriate PONG in the case ... Debugging and patch by "wowaname" on #ngircd, thanks! - Fix syntax of ERR\_LISTFULL\_MSG(478) numeric. Pointed out by "wowaname" in #ngircd, thanks! - Enhance debug messages while sending CHANINFO commands. - Reset "last try" timer when enabling a passive server. This results in a new connection attempt as soon as possible. - Change log message for "Can't resolve address" and for IP address forgeries. - doc/HowToRelease.txt: Add note about the bug tracker. - Update "CipherList" to not enable SSLv3 by default. Idea, initial patch, and testing by Christoph Biedl <ngircd.anoy@manchmal.in-ulm.de>. - Change ngIRCd test suite not to use DNS lookups: Different operating systems do behave quite differently when doing DNS lookups, for example "127.0.0.1" sometimes resolves to "localhost" and sometimes to "localhost.localdomain" (for example OpenBSD). And other OS resolve "localhost" to the real host name (for example Cygwin). So not using DNS at all makes the test site much more portable.
ngIRCd 22 (2014-10-11)
 - Match all list patterns case-insensitive: this affects the invite-, ban-, and except lists, as well as G-Lines an K-Lines. Problem pointed out by "wowaname" on #ngircd, thanks!
 ngIRCd 22~rc1 (2014-09-29) - Sync "except lists" between servers: Up to now, ban, invite, and G-Line lists have been synced between servers while linking -- but obviously nobody noticed that except list have been missing ever since. Until now. Thanks to "j4jackj", who reported this issue in #ngircd. - Allow longer user names (up to 63 characters) for authentication. - Correctly check that a server has a valid hostname and port, thanks to David Binderman <dcb314@hotmail.com> who reported this bug. - Fix the function which generates complete "IRC masks" from user input, don't destroy the source buffer and use all provided parts (nick, user, host name). This fixes GLINEs/KLINEs from not working in some situations. - Increase MAX\_SERVERS from 16 to 64: There are installations out there that would like to configure more than 16 links per server, so increase this limit. Best would be to get rid of MAX\_SERVERS altogether and make if fully dynamic, but start with this quick and dirty hack ... - Debian: Don't adjust path names that are correct by default and correctly set and use "docdir". - Update config.guess and config.sub to recent versions. - Test suite/platformtest.sh: Detect when tests have been skipped. - doc/Bopm.txt: Update "connregex" and "kline" for current ngIRCd. - Allow "DefaultUserModes" to set all possible modes, including modes only settable by IRC Operators. - Spoofed prefixes: Really kill connection on non-server links. - Implement user mode "F": "relaxed flood protection". Clients with mode "F" set are allowed to rapidly send data to the daemon. This mode is only settable by IRC Operators and can cause problems in the network -- so be careful and only set it on "trusted" clients! User mode "F" is used by Bahamut for this purpose, for example. - Handle "throttling" in a single function: ngIRCd implements "command throttling" and "bps throttling" (bytes per second). The states are detected in different functions, Conn\_Handler() and Read\_Request(), but handle the actual "throttling" in a common function: this enables us to guarantee consistent behavior and to disable throttling for special connections in only one place - Use server password when PAM is compiled in but disabled. - Streamline punctuation of log messages. - Return ISUPPORT(005) numerics on "VERSION". This is how ircd-seven, Charybdis, Hybrid, and InspIRCd behave, for example. - configure: Only link "contrib/Debian" if it exists, which isn't the case on "VPATH builds", for example. - Show the account name in WHOIS. This uses the same numeric as Charybdis and ircu families: WHOISLOGGEDIN(330). - Pattern matching: Remove "range matching" in our pattern matching code using the "[...]" syntax, because [ and ] are valid characters in nick names and one has to quote them currently using the "\" character, which is quite unexpected for users. - platformtest.sh: New option "-x", don't regenerate build system and allow using separate source and build trees. - Test suite: explicitly enable glibc memory checking. - Make "MODE -k" handling more robust and compatible, send "fake '\*' key" in all replies. - Update configure.ng: ngIRCd requires GNU autoconf 2.61 for generating its build system, so update the build system accordingly and implement all changes that autoupdate(1) suggests: Update AC\_PREREQ and AC\_INIT, use AC\_LINK\_IFELSE, AC\_RUN\_IFELSE, and AC\_COMPILE\_IFELSE, and remove AC\_TYPE\_SIGNAL (we don't use RETSIGTYPE). - portabtest: Actually test the functions snprintf(), strlcpy(), strlcat(), and vsnprintf() for correctness, not only existence (which was quite useless, because if they weren't available, the program could not have been linked at all ...). - Implement new configuration option "Network": it is used to set the (completely optional) "network name", to which this instance of the daemon belongs. When set, this name is used in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric which is sent to all clients connecting to the server after logging in. - Update doc/Platforms.txt. - Various code cleanups, remove unused code, streamline error handling. Remove all imp.h and exp.h header files, support non-standard vsnprintf() return codes, and fix some K&R C portability issues. Streamline DEBUG\_ARRAY, DEBUG\_BUFFER, DEBUG\_IO, DEBUG\_ZIP definitions. - Increase penalty time to 10 seconds when handling OPER commands with an invalid password.
ngIRCd 21.1 (2014-03-25)
 - Don't ignore but use the server password when PAM is compiled in but disabled. Thanks to Roy Sindre Norangshol <roy.sindre@norangshol.no>! - doc/Platforms.txt: Update from master branch. - Really kill connections that send "spoofed prefixes" on non-server links. This fixes commit 6cbe1308 which only killed the connection when the spoofed prefix itself belonged to a non-server client. - CHARCONV command: Fix handling conversion errors, don't overwrite already converted text! - doc/Services.txt: Update information for Anope 2.x. - Correctly use cloaked IRC masks on "INVITE nickname": The cloaked IRC mask of a user is his visible mask, so the daemon has to use it for generating the "one time" entries for the invite list of the given channel, and not the "real" mask which will never match while the target client is "+x", and even worse, will disclose the real mask on "MODE #channel +I" commands :-/ Bug reported by Cahata on #ngircd, thanks! - configure: Only link "contrib/Debian" if it exists. This isn't the case on "VPATH builds", for example. - Use $(MKDIR\_P) instead of $(mkinstalldirs) in Makefile's and test for "mkdir -p" using AC\_PROG\_MKDIR\_P in "configure". - Fix configure script and "make check" for TCP Wrappers (problems spotted on OpenBSD): add missing #include's and static variables, and add libwrap at the end of the configure run because if libwrap becomes added earlier, other tests may fail. - configure: add support for the LDFLAGS\_END and LIBS\_END variables to add linker flags and libraries at the end of the configure run (CFLAGS\_END has been implemented already). - platformtest.sh and Makefile.am: Don't use "test -e", it isn't portable. - Update Copyright notices for 2014 :-) - Fix permanent {G|K}LINES (with a timeout of 0 seconds). - WEBIRC: Don't set the hostname received by the WEBIRC command when DNS lookups are disabled, but use the IP address instead. Reported by Toni Spets <toni.spets@iki.fi>, thanks! - Check for working getaddrinfo() function: At least AIX 4.3.3 and 5.1 have a broken implementation of getaddrinfo() which doesn't handle "0" as numeric service correctly. This patch adds a configure check for this case and changes all calling functions to only use getaddrinfo() if it "works". See <http://www.stacken.kth.se/lists/heimdal-discuss/2004-05/msg00059.html> - Only use the unsetenv() function when it is available (AIX 4.3 doesn't support it, for example). - Make sure that the source code is still compatible with the "ansi2knr" tool and builds using non-ANSI K&R C compilers. Tested with Apple C on A/UX. - Fix building ngIRCd without support for ZLIB compression. Reported by "der\_baer" on #ngircd, thanks!
ngIRCd 21 (2013-10-30)
 - ./contrib/Debian/ngircd.init: Make sure no stale PID file is left over when (re-)starting ngIRCd. - Change ./contrib/platformtest.sh and update ./doc/Platforms.txt to allow user names up to 8 characters. - Call arc4random\_stir() in forked subprocesses, when available. This is required by FreeBSD <10 and current NetBSD at least to correctly initialize the "arc4" random number generator on these platforms. - Update our own Debian package configuration and fix the default path of the "HelpFile" of the "full" package variants.
 ngIRCd 21~rc2 (2013-10-20) - Report the correct configuration file name on configuration errors, support longer configuration lines, and warn when lines are truncated. - Use arc4random() function to generate "random" numbers, when available. - platformtest.sh: Detect clang compiler, and clean up GIT source tree before building (when possible). - Update (date of) manual pages. - Update "Upgrade Information" in INSTALL file, add more systems to doc/Platforms.txt, and fix spelling in NEWS and ChangeLog files =:) - Fix remaining compiler warnings on OpenBSD.
 ngIRCd 21~rc1 (2013-10-05) - Actually KILL clients on GLINE/KLINE. (Closes bug #156) - Adjust log messages for invalid and spoofed prefixes, which cleans up logging of commands related to already KILL'ed clients. And don't forward KILL commands for (already) unknown clients any more to prevent unnecessary duplicates. - Add support to show all user links using the "STATS L" (uppercase) command (restricted to IRC Operators). - Fixed blocking of server reconnects in some error configurations. - Don't ignore SSL-related errors during startup any more: abort startup when SSL is requested by the configuration but can't be initialized and don't continue only listening on plain text communication ports. (Closes bug #163) - Implement configurable SSL cipher list selection for GnuTLS and OpenSSL using the new configuration option "CipherList". In addition, this changes the defaults to more secure values: "HIGH:!aNULL:@STRENGTH" for OpenSSL, and "SECURE128" for GnuTLS. - Fix "TRACE": Correctly return ERR\_NEEDMOREPARAMS(461) (which basically is "syntax error") when there are too many parameters. - Clean up lots of permission and parameter checks in functions handling IRC commands; and more consistently add penalty times on errors. - Fix error numeric of WHOIS when no nick name has been provided: as per RFC it should be ERR\_NONICKNAMEGIVEN(431). - Only log "IDENT ... no result" messages when an IDENT looked took place and didn't return any data, not when IDENT has been disabled. - Show connection flag "s" (SSL) in RPL\_TRACE{LINK|SERVER} messages: now you can check if a server-to-server link is SSL-encrypted or not using the IRC "TRACE" command. - Correctly discard supplementary groups on server startup. - Save client IP address text for "WebIRC" users and correctly display it on WHOIS, for example. (Closes bug #159) - Implement the new configuration option "DefaultUserModes" which lists user modes that become automatically set on new local clients right after login. Please note that only modes can be set that the client could set on itself, so you can't set "a" (away) or "o" (IRC Op), for example! User modes "i" (invisible) or "x" (cloaked) etc. are "interesting", though. (Closes bug #160) - Add support for the new METADATA "account" property, which allows services to automatically identify users after netsplits and across service restarts. - Enforce "penalty times" on error conditions more consistently and in more places. Now most error codes sent back from the IRC server to the client should result in a 2 second "penalty". - Implement a new configuration option "AllowedChannelTypes" that lists all allowed channel types (channel prefixes) for newly created channels on the local server. By default, all supported channel types are allowed. If set to the empty string, local clients can't create new channels at all, which equals the old "PredefChannelsOnly = yes" setting. This change deprecates the "PredefChannelsOnly" variable, too, but it is still supported and translated to the appropriate "AllowedChannelTypes" setting. When the old "PredefChannelsOnly" variable is processed, a warning message is logged. (Closes bug #152) - Add support for "client certificate fingerprinting". When a client passes an SSL certificate to the server, the "fingerprint" will be forwarded in the network which enables IRC services to identify the user using this certificate and not using passwords. - IRC Operator names, as defined in ngircd.conf, are logged now when handling successful OPER commands. - Some error conditions while handling IRC commands, like "permission denied" or "need more parameters", result in more penalty times. - The numeric replies of some commands became split too early which resulted in more numeric reply lines than necessary. - Implement a new configuration option "IncludeDir" in the "[Options]" section that can be used to specify a directory which can contain further configuration files and configuration file snippets matching the pattern "\*.conf". These files are read in after the main server configuration file ("ngircd.conf" by default) has been read in and parsed. The default is "$SYSCONFDIR/ngircd.conf.d", so that it is possible to adjust the configuration only by placing additional files into this directory. (Closes bug #157) - Fix use-after-free in the Lists\_CheckReason() function, which is used to check if a client is a member of a particular ban/invite/... list. - Xcode: fix detection of host OS, vendor, and CPU type, and update project settings for Xcode 5. - OS X PackageMaker: use relative path names in project files and package with correct file permissions (requires root privileges on "make"). - Add Travis-CI configuration file (".travis.yml") to project. - Look for possible cloaked Masks in Lists. Users with +x user mode can be banned with their cloaked hostname now. - Don't read SSL client data before DNS resolver is finished which could have resulted in discarding the resolved client hostname and IDENT reply afterwards, because in some situations (timing dependent) the NICK and USER commands could have already been read in from the client, stored in the buffer, and been processed. Thanks to Julian Brost for reporting the issue and testing, and to Federico G. Schwindt <fgsch@lodoss.net> for helping to debug it! - Increase password length limit to 64 characters. (Closes bug #154) - doc/Services.txt: Update Anope status and URL. - Clean up Xcode project file, remove outdated files, add missing ones. - Update Doxygen configuration file. - configure: search for iconv\_open as well as libiconv\_open, because on some installations iconv\_open() is actually libiconv\_open(). iconv\_open() is the glibc version while libiconv\_open() is the libiconv version, now both variants are supported. (Closes bug #151) - ngIRCd now accepts user names including "@" characters, saves the unmodified name for authentication but stores only the part in front of the "@" character as "IRC user name". And the latter is how ircd2.11, Bahamut, and irc-seven behave as well. (Closes bug #155) - Lots of IRC "information functions" like ADMIN, INFO, ... now accept server masks and names of connected users (in addition to server names) for specifying the target server of the command. (Closes bug #153) - Implement a new configuration option "IdleTimeout" in the "[Limits]" section of the configuration file which can be used to set a timeout in seconds after which the whole daemon will shutdown when no more connections are left active after handling at least one client. The default is 0, "never". This can be useful for testing or when ngIRCd is started using "socket activation" with systemd(8), for example. - Implement support for systemd(8) "socket activation". - contrib/README: add description for more files. - Enable WHOIS to display information about IRC Services using the new numeric 310(RPL\_WHOISSERVICE) This numeric is used for this purpose by InspIRCd, for example -- but as usual, other numerics are in use, too, like 613 in UltimateIRCd ... Please note that neither the Operator (+o) not the "bot status" (+B) of an IRC service is displayed in the output. - Exit message: use singular & plural :-) - autogen.sh: Check for autoconf/automake wrapper scripts - Add missing punctuation marks in log messages, adjust some severity levels, and make SSL-related messages more readable. - AUTHORS file: Update list of contributors. - Update systemd(8) example configuration files in ./contrib/ directory: the "ngircd.service" file now uses the "forking" service type which enhances the log messages shown by "systemctl status ngircd.service", and the new "ngircd.socket" file configures a systemd socket that configures a socket for ngIRCd and launches the daemon on demand. - Enhance help system and the HELP command: now a "help text file" can be set using the new configuration option "HelpFile" ("global" section), which is read in and parsed on server startup and configuration reload, and then is used to output individual help texts to specific topics. Please see the file ./doc/Commands.txt for details.
ngIRCd 20.3 (2013-08-23)
 - Security: Fix a denial of service bug (server crash) which could happen when the configuration option "NoticeAuth" is enabled (which is NOT the default) and ngIRCd failed to send the "notice auth" messages to new clients connecting to the server (CVE-2013-5580).
ngIRCd 20.2 (2013-02-15)
 - Security: Fix a denial of service bug in the function handling KICK commands that could be used by arbitrary users to crash the daemon (CVE-2013-1747). - WHO command: Use the currently "displayed hostname" (which can be cloaked!) for hostname matching, not the real one. In other words: don't display all the cloaked users on a specific real hostname! - configure: The header file "netinet/in\_systm.h" already is optional in ngIRCd, so don't require it in the configure script. Now ngIRCd can be built on Minix 3 again :-) - Return better "Connection not registered as server link" errors: Now ngIRCd returns a more specific error message for numeric ERR\_NOTREGISTERED(451) when a regular user tries to use a command that isn't allowed for users but for servers. - Don't report ERR\_NEEDMOREPARAMS(461) when a MDOE command with more modes than nicknames is handled, as well as for channel limit and key changes without specifying the limit or key parameters. This is how a lot (all?) other IRC servers behave, including ircd2.11, InspIRCd, and ircd-seven. And because of clients (tested with Textual and mIRC) sending bogus MODE commands like "MODE -ooo nick", end-users got the expected result as well as correct but misleading error messages ... - Correctly detect when SSL subsystem must be initialized and take outgoing connections (server links!) into account, too. - autogen.sh: Enforce serial test harness on GNU automake >=1.13. The new parallel test harness which is enabled by default starting with automake 1.13 isn't compatible with our test suite. And don't use "egrep -o", instead use "sed", because it isn't portable and not available on OpenBSD, for example.
ngIRCd 20.1 (2013-01-02)
 - Allow ERROR command on server and service links only, ignore them and add a penalty time on all other link types. - Enforced mode setting by IRC Operators: Only check the channel user modes of the initiator if he is joined to the channel and not an IRC operator enforcing modes (which requires the configuration option "OperCanUseMode" to be enabled), because trying to check channel user modes of a non-member results in an assertion when running with debug code or could crash the daemon otherwise. This closes bug #147, thanks to James Kirwill <james.kirwill@bk.ru> for tracking this down! - Fix build system to cope with spaces in path names. - Code cleanups, mostly to fix build warnings on Cygwin.
ngIRCd 20 (2012-12-17)
 - Allow user names ("INDENT") up to 20 characters when ngIRCd has not been configured for "strict RFC mode". This is useful if you are using external (PAM) authentication mechanisms that require longer user names. Patch suggested by Brett Smith <brett@w3.org>, see <http://arthur.barton.de/pipermail/ngircd-ml/2012-October/000579.html>.
 ngIRCd 20~rc2 (2012-12-02) - Rework cloaked hostname handling and implement the "METADATA cloakhost" subcommand: Now ngIRCd uses two fields internally, one to store the "real" hostname and one to save the "cloaked" hostname. This allows "foreign servers" (aka "IRC services") to alter the real and cloaked hostnames of clients without problems, even when the user itself issues additional "MODE +x" and "MODE -x" commands. - RPL\_UMODEIS: send correct target name, even on server links. - Update platformtest.sh to follow autoconf changes and only generate the "configure" script when it is missing. - Fix the test suite to correctly execute test scripts even when stdout is redirected. - Fix some compiler warnings on NetBSD and OpenBSD.
 ngIRCd 20~rc1 (2012-11-11) - Update doc/Services.txt: describe the upcoming version of Anope 1.9.8, then including a protocol module for ngIRCd. And remove our own patches in ./contrib/Anope because they aren't supported any more ... - Implement new "METADATA" command which can be used by remote servers and IRC services to update client metadata like the client info text ("real name"), user name, and hostname, and use this command to configure an cloaked hostname (user mode "+x") on remote servers: This prevents "double cloaking" of hostnames and even cloaked hostnames are in sync on all servers supporting "METADATA" now. - Fix error message when trying to join non-predefined channels and the "PredefChannelsOnly" configuration option is set. - Implement new IRC "SVSNICK" command to allow remote servers (and IRC services) to change nicknames of already registered users. The SVSNICK command itself doesn't change the nickname, but it becomes forwarded to the server to which the user is connected to. And then this server initiates the real nickname changing using regular NICK commands. This allows to run mixed networks with old servers not supporting the SVSNICK command, because SVSNICK commands for nicknames on such servers are silently ignored and don't cause a desynchronization of the network. - Make server reconnect time a little bit more random, so that two servers trying to connect to each other asynchronously don't try this in exactly the same time periods and kick each other off ... - Don't accept connections for servers already being linked: there was a time frame that could result in one connection overwriting the other, e. g. the incoming connection overwriting the status of the outgoing one. And this could lead to all kind of weirdness (even crashes!) later on: now such incoming connections are dropped. - New configuration option "MaxListSize" to configure the maximum number of channels returned by a LIST command. The default is 100, as before. - Implement user mode "b", "block messages": when a user has set mode "b", all private messages and notices to this user are blocked if they don't originate from a registered user, an IRC Op, server or service. The originator gets an error numeric sent back in this case, ERR\_NONONREG\_MSG (486), which is used by UnrealIRCd, too. (Closes #144) - WHOIS: Not only show RPL\_WHOISHOST\_MSG to local IRC operators, but show it to all IRC operators in the network. And don't show it to anybody if[View remainder of file in raw view](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/raw/refs/heads/master/ChangeLog)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

 ngIRCd - Next Generation IRC Server http://ngircd.barton.de/
 (c)2001-2024 Alexander Barton and Contributors. ngIRCd is free software and published under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
 -- NEWS --
ngIRCd 27 (2024-04-26)
 - Add an example filter file for "Fail2Ban": contrib/ngircd-fail2ban.conf.
 ngIRCd 27~rc1 (2024-04-13) - Validate certificates on server links. Up to now, ngIRCd optionally used SSL/TLS encrypted server-server links but never checked and validated any certificates. Now ngIRCd validates SSL/TLS certificates on outgoing server-server links by default and drops(!) connections when the remote certificate is invalid (for example self-signed, expired, not matching the host name, ...). Therefore you have to make sure that all relevant \*certificates are valid\* (or to disable certificate validation on this connection using the new `SSLVerify = false` setting in the affected `[Server]` block, where the remote certificate is not valid and you can not fix this issue). The original patch for OpenSSL dates back to 2009 and was written by Florian Westphal and was extended for GnuTLS in 2014 by Christoph Biedl. But it took us another 10 years to bring it to life ... oh my! Many thanks to both Florian and Christoph! Closes #120. - Add support for the "sd\_notify" protocol of systemd(8): Periodically "ping" the service manager (every 3 seconds) and set a status message showing current connection statistics which then is included in "systemctl status ngircd.service" output. In addition, this enables using the systemd(8) watchdog functionality ("WatchdogSec") for the "ngircd.service" unit and allows it to use the "notify" service type, which results in better status tracking by the service manager. - Try to set file descriptor limit to its maximum and show info on startup: The number of possible parallel connections is limited by the file descriptor limit of the process (among other things). Therefore try to upgrade the current "soft" limit to its "hard" maximum (but limited to 100000 instead of "infinite"), and show an information or even warning when the limit is still less than the configured "MaxConnections" setting. Please note that ngIRCd and its linked libraries (like PAM) need file descriptors not only for incoming and outgoing IRC connections, but for reading files and inter-process communication, too! Therefore the actual connection limit is less(!) than the file descriptor limit! - Add a "Docker file" (contrib/Dockerfile) and corresponding documentation (doc/Container.md) to the project. The resulting container is based on the latest Debian "stable-slim" container and built using a "build container". - No longer use a default built-in value for the "IncludeDir" directive when a configuration file was explicitly specified on the command line using "--config"/"-f": This way no default include directory is scanned when a possibly non-default configuration file is used which (intentionally) did not specify an "IncludeDir" directive. So now you can use "-f /dev/null" for checking all built-in defaults, regardless of any local configuration files in the default drop-in directory (which would have been read in until this change). - The server "Name" in the "[Global]" section of the configuration file no longer needs to be set: When not set (or empty), ngIRCd now tries to deduce a valid IRC server name from the local host name ("node name"), possibly adding a ".host" extension when the host name does not contain a dot (".") which is required in an IRC server name ("ID"). This new behavior, with all configuration parameters now being optional, allows running ngIRCd without any configuration file at all. - Autodetect support for IPv6 by default: Until now, IPv6 support was disabled by default, which seems a bit outdated in 2024. Note: You still can pass "--enable-ipv6"/"--disable-ipv6" to the ./configure script to forcefully activate or deactivate IPv6 support. - Do IDENT requests even when DNS lookups are disabled: Up to now disabling DNS in the configuration disabled IDENT lookups as well (for no good reason). Now you can activate/deactivate DNS lookups and IDENT requests completely separately. Thanks for reporting this, Miniontoby! Closes #291. - Allow SSL client-only configurations without keys/certificates: You don't need to configure certificates/keys as long as you don't configure SSL-enabled listening ports. This can make sense when you want to only link your local daemon to an uplink server using SSL and only have clients on your local host or in your fully trusted network, where SSL is not required. - Respect "SSLConnect" option for incoming connections and do not accept incoming plain-text ("non SSL") server connections for servers configured with "SSLConnect" enabled. This change prevents an authenticated client-server being able to force the server-server to send its password on a plain-text connection when SSL/TLS was intended. - Add a new option "Autojoin" to [Channel] blocks: When it is set, ngIRCd automatically joins all local users to this channel on connect. Note: The users must have permissions to access the channel, otherwise joining them will fail! Thanks Ivan Agarkov <i\_agarkov@wargaming.net> for the initial patch! - Hide invisible (+i) users on "WHOIS <pattern>": Let's behave like most(?) other IRC daemons (at least ircd2.11) and hide all +i users when WHOIS is used with a pattern. Otherwise privacy of this users is not guaranteed and the +i mode a bit useless ... Reported by Cahata on #ngircd, thanks! - Make the debug log level ("--debug"/-"d" command line option) always available, not only when ./configure'd with "--enable-debug": the latter now only enables additional checks (like the tests done using assert(2)) and is signalled by adding "+DEBUG" to the version "feature string". This change enables everyone to get even more detailed logging when required. - Allow IRC Operators to use the WHO command on any channel. - Send the NAMES list and channel topic to users "forcefully" joined to a channel using NJOIN, like they joined on their own using JOIN, and streamline the order of NAMES list and channel topic messages. Closes #288. - Added a new command line option "-y"/"--syslog", with which logging to syslog can be activated/deactivated separately from running on the console (using "--nodaemon") or in the background. Thanks Katherine Peeters for the patch and pull request! Closes #294. - Update, enhance and extend our documentation in README.md, INSTALL.md, doc/HowToRelease.txt and the manual pages ngircd(8) and ngircd.conf(5), add a new doc/QuickStart.md document, and convert some more documentation files to Markdown (AUTHORS.md, contrib/README.md, doc/FAQ.md, doc/SSL.md).
ngIRCd 26.1 (2021-01-02)
 - This release is a bugfix release only, without new features.
ngIRCd 26 (2020-06-20)
 ngIRCd 26~rc2 (2020-06-11) - Add AppStream metadata file (contrib/de.barton.ngircd.metainfo.xml). - Various bug fixes, see the ChangeLog. No new or changed functionality.
 ngIRCd 26~rc1 (2020-05-10) - Allow up to 512 characters per line in MOTD and help text files (but keep in mind that lines can't get that long, because they have to be prefixed before being sent to the client). But this allows for more fancy MOTDs :-) Closes #271. - Show the actually allowed channel types in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric which are configured by the "AllowedChannelTypes" configuration variable. Closes #273. - Handle commands in the read buffer before reading more data and don't wait for the network in this case: If there are more bytes in the read buffer already than a single valid IRC command can get long (513 bytes), wait for this/those command(s) to be handled first and don't try to read even more data from the network (which most probably would overflow the read buffer of this connection soon). - Log G-/K-Line changes only when not initiated by a server: this prevents the log from becoming spammed during "net bursts". - Update test suite to include SSL tests, including checking for reloading certificates during runtime. - Add support for GnuTLS certificate reload, which is quite handy when using Let's Encrypt, for example. Until now this was only supported when linked with OpenSSL. Thanks a lot, Hilko Bengen <bengen@hilluzination.de>! - Allow setting arbitrary channel modes in the configuration file by handling them like in MODE commands, and allow multiple "Modes =" lines per [Channel] section. Thanks to Michi <michi+ngircd@dataswamp.org>! Closes #55. - Add "FNC" (forced nick changes) to ISUPPORT(005) numeric. Most probably this doesn't make any difference to any client, but it seems correct. See <http://www.irc.org/tech\_docs/005.html> for details. - Enhance handling of command line errors, and return with exit code 0 ("no error") when "--help" or "--version" is used (which resulted in exit code 1, "error" before). Exit with code 2 ("command line error") for all other invalid command line options, and show the error message itself on stderr (instead of stdout and exit code 1, "generic error", as before). This new behavior is more in line with the GNU "coding standards", see <https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html\_node/\_002d\_002dhelp.html>. - Add ./contrib/nglog.sh: This script parses the log output of ngircd(8), and colorizes the messages according to their log level. Example usage: ngircd -f $PWD/doc/sample-ngircd.conf -np | ./contrib/nglog.sh - Enlarge buffers of info texts to 128 bytes. This includes: - "Real name" of a client (4th filed of the USER command). - Server info text ("Info" configuration option). - Admin info texts and email address ("AdminInfo1", "AdminInfo2" and "AdminEmail" configuration options). - Network name ("Network" configuration option). The limit was 64 bytes before ... Closes #258. - Streamline handling of invalid and unset server name: Don't exit during runtime (REHASH command, HUP signal), because the server name can't be changed in this case anyway and the new invalid name will be ignored. - Slightly reorder startup steps, and enhance logging: - Show name of configuration file at the beginning of start up. - Add a message when ngIRCd is ready, including its host name. - Show name of configuration file on REHASH (SIGHUP), too. - Change level of "done message" to NOTICE, like "starting" & "ready". - Initialize IO functions before channels, connections, clients, ... - configure.ng: OpenSSL can depends on lz or latomic so use pkg-config to find those dependencies and fallback to existing mechanism. Closes #256.
ngIRCd 25 (2019-01-23)
 - Implement new configuration option "MaxPenaltyTime", which configures the maximum penalty time increase in seconds, per penalty event. Set to -1 for no limit (the default), 0 to disable penalties altogether. ngIRCd doesn't use penalty increases higher than 2 seconds during normal operation, so values higher than 1 rarely make sense. Disabling (or reducing) penalties can greatly speed up "make check" runs for example, see below, but are mostly a debugging feature and normally not meant to be used on production systems! Some example timings running "make check" from my macOS workstation: - MaxPenaltyTime not set: 4:41,79s - "MaxPenaltyTime = 1": 3:14,71s - "MaxPenaltyTime = 0": 25,46s Closes #249 and #251. - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (10.0) - Allow a 5th parameter in WEBIRC. Thanks to "ItsOnlyBinary". Closes #247.
 ngIRCd 25~rc1 (2018-08-11) - Only send TOPIC updates to a channel when the topic actually changed: This prevents the channel from becoming flooded by unnecessary TOPIC update messages, that can happen when IRC services try to enforce a certain topic but which is already set (at least on the local server), for example. Therefore still forward it to all servers, but don't inform local clients (still update setter and timestamp information, though!). - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (9.2). This includes adding missing and deleting obsolete file references. - Handle user mode "C" ("Only users that share a channel are allowed to send messages") like user mode "b" ("block private messages and notices"): allow messages from servers, services, and IRC Operators, too. Change proposed by "wowaname" back in 2015 in #ngircd, thanks! - Allow IRC Ops and remote servers to KILL service clients: such clients behave like regular users, therefore IRC operators and servers should be able to KILL them: for example to resolve nick collisions. Closes #242.
ngIRCd 24 (2017-01-20)
 ngIRCd 24~rc1 (2017-01-07) - Log privilege violations and failed OPER request with log level "error" and send it to the "&SERVER" channel, too. - Immediately shut down connection when receiving an "ERROR" command, don't wait for the peer to close the connection. This allows the daemon to forward the received "ERROR" message in the network, instead of the very generic "client closed connection" message. - Explicitly forbid remote servers to modify "x-lines" (G-LINES) when the "AllowRemoteOper" configuration option isn't set, even when the command seems to originate from the remote server itself: this prevents GLINE's to become set during server handshake in this case (what wouldn't be possible during regular runtime when a remote IRC Op sends the command) and what can't be undone by IRC Ops later on (because of the missing "AllowRemoteOper" option) ... - Update Xcode project for latest Xcode version (8.0), and fix "duplicate symbols" error messages when building (linking) the binary. - Add "Documentation" variables to systemd configuration files. - Make sure that SYSCONFDIR is always set, which can be handy when using source code linters when ./configure hasn't been run already. - Add the new "PAMServiceName" configuration option to specify the name used as PAM service name. This setting allows to run multiple ngIRCd instances with different PAM configurations for each instance. Thanks to Christian Aistleitner <christian@quelltextlich.at> for the patch, closes #226. - Add an ".editorconfig" file to the project. - Limit the number of message target, and suppress duplicates: This prevents an user from flooding the server using commands like this: "PRIVMSG nick1,nick1,nick1,...". Duplicate targets are suppressed silently (channels and clients). In addition, the maximum number of targets per PRIVMSG, NOTICE, ... command are limited to MAX\_HNDL\_TARGETS (25). If there are more, the daemon sends the new 407 (ERR\_TOOMANYTARGETS\_MSG) numeric, containing the first target that hasn't been handled any more. Closes #187. - Make contrib/platformtest.sh script more portable, and only show "runs=Y" when the test suite really has been passed successfully.
ngIRCd 23 (2015-11-16)
 ngIRCd 23~rc1 (2015-09-06) - Use "NOTICE \*" before registration instead of "NOTICE AUTH". "AUTH" is a valid nickname so sending notices to it is probably not a good idea. Use "\*" as the target instead as done with numerics when the nick is not available. This mimics the behavior in Charybdis, IRCD-Hybrid, InspIRCd 2.2, Plexus 4, etc. Closes #217. The "NoticeAuth" configuration variable (ngircd.conf) has been renamed to "NoticeBeforeRegistration" accordingly, but the old name is still supported for compatibility reasons. - Implement new channel mode "N" (regular users can't change their nick name while on this channel). Closes #214. - Keep track of who placed bans, invites, and excepts. Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #203. - Implement numeric RPL\_LISTSTART(321). lightIRC and other clients expecting RPL\_LISTSTART should now behave correctly. Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #207. - Streamline the effect of "MorePrivacy" option: Update documentation in ngircd.conf(5); don't hide channels for IRC Ops on LIST and don't hide IP addresses/hostnames on WHOIS when "MorePrivacy" is in effect. This closes #198. - IRC operators now can kick anyone when "OperCanMode" is set. Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #202. - Implement user mode "I": Hide channels on WHOIS: this mode prevents ngIRCd from showing channels on WHOIS (IRC Operators can always see the channel list). Idea and implementation by LucentW, Thanks! Closes #197. - INVITE command: Implement ERR\_USERNOTONSERV(504) numeric and make sure that the target user is on the same server when inviting other users to local ("&") channels. Idea by Cahata, thanks! Closes #183. - MODE command: Always report channel creation time. Up to now when receiving a MODE command, ngIRCd only reported the channel creation time to clients that were members of the channel. This patch reports the channel creation time to all clients, regardless if they are joined to that channel or not. At least ircd-seven behaves like this. This closes #188. Reported by Cahata, thanks!
ngIRCd 22.1 (2015-04-06)
 - Update "CipherList" to not enable SSLv3 by default. Idea, initial patch, and testing by Christoph Biedl <ngircd.anoy@manchmal.in-ulm.de>. - Change ngIRCd test suite not to use DNS lookups: Different operating systems do behave quite differently when doing DNS lookups, for example "127.0.0.1" sometimes resolves to "localhost" and sometimes to "localhost.localdomain" (for example OpenBSD). And other OS resolve "localhost" to the real host name (for example Cygwin). So not using DNS at all makes the test site much more portable.
ngIRCd 22 (2014-10-11)
 - Match all list patterns case-insensitive: this affects the invite-, ban-, and except lists, as well as G-Lines an K-Lines. Problem pointed out by "wowaname" on #ngircd, thanks!
 ngIRCd 22~rc1 (2014-09-29) - Sync "except lists" between servers: Up to now, ban, invite, and G-Line lists have been synced between servers while linking -- but obviously nobody noticed that except list have been missing ever since. Until now. Thanks to "j4jackj", who reported this issue in #ngircd. - Allow longer user names (up to 63 characters) for authentication. - Increase MAX\_SERVERS from 16 to 64: There are installations out there that would like to configure more than 16 links per server, so increase this limit. Best would be to get rid of MAX\_SERVERS altogether and make if fully dynamic, but start with this quick and dirty hack ... - Test suite/platformtest.sh: Detect when tests have been skipped. - Allow "DefaultUserModes" to set all possible modes, including modes only settable by IRC Operators. - Implement user mode "F": "relaxed flood protection". Clients with mode "F" set are allowed to rapidly send data to the daemon. This mode is only settable by IRC Operators and can cause problems in the network -- so be careful and only set it on "trusted" clients! User mode "F" is used by Bahamut for this purpose, for example. - Use server password when PAM is compiled in but disabled. - Streamline punctuation of log messages. - Return ISUPPORT(005) numerics on "VERSION". This is how ircd-seven, Charybdis, Hybrid, and InspIRCd behave, for example. - configure: Only link "contrib/Debian" if it exists, which isn't the case on "VPATH builds", for example. - Show the account name in WHOIS. This uses the same numeric as Charybdis and ircu families: WHOISLOGGEDIN(330). - Pattern matching: Remove "range matching" in our pattern matching code using the "[...]" syntax, because [ and ] are valid characters in nick names and one has to quote them currently using the "\" character, which is quite unexpected for users. - platformtest.sh: New option "-x", don't regenerate build system and allow using separate source and build trees. - Test suite: explicitly enable glibc memory checking. - Make "MODE -k" handling more robust and compatible, send "fake '\*' key" in all replies. - portabtest: Actually test the functions snprintf(), strlcpy(), strlcat(), and vsnprintf() for correctness, not only existence (which was quite useless, because if they weren't available, the program could not have been linked at all ...). - Implement new configuration option "Network": it is used to set the (completely optional) "network name", to which this instance of the daemon belongs. When set, this name is used in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric which is sent to all clients connecting to the server after logging in. - Update doc/Platforms.txt. - Various code cleanups, remove unused code, streamline error handling. Remove all imp.h and exp.h header files, support non-standard vsnprintf() return codes, and fix some K&R C portability issues. Streamline DEBUG\_ARRAY, DEBUG\_BUFFER, DEBUG\_IO, DEBUG\_ZIP definitions. - Increase penalty time to 10 seconds when handling OPER commands with an invalid password.
ngIRCd 21.1 (2014-03-25)
 - Don't ignore but use the server password when PAM is compiled in but disabled. Thanks to Roy Sindre Norangshol <roy.sindre@norangshol.no>! - doc/Platforms.txt: Update from master branch. - doc/Services.txt: Update information for Anope 2.x. - configure: add support for the LDFLAGS\_END and LIBS\_END variables to add linker flags and libraries at the end of the configure run (CFLAGS\_END has been implemented already). - Update Copyright notices for 2014 :-)
ngIRCd 21 (2013-10-30)
 - Call arc4random\_stir() in forked subprocesses, when available. This is required by FreeBSD <10 and current NetBSD at least to correctly initialize the "arc4" random number generator on these platforms.
 ngIRCd 21~rc2 (2013-10-20) - Report the correct configuration file name on configuration errors, support longer configuration lines, and warn when lines are truncated.
 ngIRCd 21~rc1 (2013-10-05) - Actually KILL clients on GLINE/KLINE. (Closes bug #156) - Add support to show all user links using the "STATS L" (uppercase) command (restricted to IRC Operators). - Implement configurable SSL cipher list selection for GnuTLS and OpenSSL using the new configuration option "CipherList". In addition, this changes the defaults to more secure values: "HIGH:!aNULL:@STRENGTH" for OpenSSL, and "SECURE128" for GnuTLS. - Show connection flag "s" (SSL) in RPL\_TRACE{LINK|SERVER} messages: now you can check if a server-to-server link is SSL-encrypted or not using the IRC "TRACE" command. - Implement the new configuration option "DefaultUserModes" which lists user modes that become automatically set on new local clients right after login. Please note that only modes can be set that the client could set on itself, so you can't set "a" (away) or "o" (IRC Op), for example! User modes "i" (invisible) or "x" (cloaked) etc. are "interesting", though. (Closes bug #160) - Add support for the new METADATA "account" property, which allows services to automatically identify users after netsplits and across service restarts. - Implement a new configuration option "AllowedChannelTypes" that lists all allowed channel types (channel prefixes) for newly created channels on the local server. By default, all supported channel types are allowed. If set to the empty string, local clients can't create new channels at all, which equals the old "PredefChannelsOnly = yes" setting. This change deprecates the "PredefChannelsOnly" variable, too, but it is still supported and translated to the appropriate "AllowedChannelTypes" setting. When the old "PredefChannelsOnly" variable is processed, a warning message is logged. (Closes bug #152) - Add support for "client certificate fingerprinting". When a client passes an SSL certificate to the server, the "fingerprint" will be forwarded in the network which enables IRC services to identify the user using this certificate and not using passwords. - Implement a new configuration option "IncludeDir" in the "[Options]" section that can be used to specify a directory which can contain further configuration files and configuration file snippets matching the pattern "\*.conf". These files are read in after the main server configuration file ("ngircd.conf" by default) has been read in and parsed. The default is "$SYSCONFDIR/ngircd.conf.d", so that it is possible to adjust the configuration only by placing additional files into this directory. (Closes bug #157) - Add Travis-CI configuration file (".travis.yml") to project. - ngIRCd now accepts user names including "@" characters, saves the unmodified name for authentication but stores only the part in front of the "@" character as "IRC user name". And the latter is how ircd2.11, Bahamut, and irc-seven behave as well. (Closes bug #155) - Lots of IRC "information functions" like ADMIN, INFO, ... now accept server masks and names of connected users (in addition to server names) for specifying the target server of the command. (Closes bug #153) - Implement a new configuration option "IdleTimeout" in the "[Limits]" section of the configuration file which can be used to set a timeout in seconds after which the whole daemon will shutdown when no more connections are left active after handling at least one client. The default is 0, "never". This can be useful for testing or when ngIRCd is started using "socket activation" with systemd(8), for example. - Implement support for systemd(8) "socket activation". - Enable WHOIS to display information about IRC Services using the new numeric 310(RPL\_WHOISSERVICE) This numeric is used for this purpose by InspIRCd, for example -- but as usual, other numerics are in use, too, like 613 in UltimateIRCd ... Please note that neither the Operator (+o) not the "bot status" (+B) of an IRC service is displayed in the output. - Update systemd(8) example configuration files in ./contrib/ directory: the "ngircd.service" file now uses the "forking" service type which enhances the log messages shown by "systemctl status ngircd.service", and the new "ngircd.socket" file configures a systemd socket that configures a socket for ngIRCd and launches the daemon on demand. - Enhance help system and the HELP command: now a "help text file" can be set using the new configuration option "HelpFile" ("global" section), which is read in and parsed on server startup and configuration reload, and then is used to output individual help texts to specific topics. Please see the file ./doc/Commands.txt for details.
ngIRCd 20.3 (2013-08-23)
 - This release is a bugfix release only, without new features. - Security: Fix a denial of service bug (server crash) which could happen when the configuration option "NoticeAuth" is enabled (which is NOT the default) and ngIRCd failed to send the "notice auth" messages to new clients connecting to the server (CVE-2013-5580).
ngIRCd 20.2 (2013-02-15)
 - This release is a bugfix release only, without new features. - Security: Fix a denial of service bug in the function handling KICK commands that could be used by arbitrary users to crash the daemon (CVE-2013-1747).
ngIRCd 20.1 (2013-01-02)
 - This release is a bugfix release only, without new features.
ngIRCd 20 (2012-12-17)
 - Allow user names ("INDENT") up to 20 characters when ngIRCd has not been configured for "strict RFC mode". This is useful if you are using external (PAM) authentication mechanisms that require longer user names. Patch suggested by Brett Smith <brett@w3.org>, see <http://arthur.barton.de/pipermail/ngircd-ml/2012-October/000579.html>.
 ngIRCd 20~rc2 (2012-12-02) - Rework cloaked hostname handling and implement the "METADATA cloakhost" subcommand: Now ngIRCd uses two fields internally, one to store the "real" hostname and one to save the "cloaked" hostname. This allows "foreign servers" (aka "IRC services") to alter the real and cloaked hostnames of clients without problems, even when the user itself issues additional "MODE +x" and "MODE -x" commands.
 ngIRCd 20~rc1 (2012-11-11) - Update doc/Services.txt: describe the upcoming version of Anope 1.9.8, then including a protocol module for ngIRCd. And remove our own patches in ./contrib/Anope because they aren't supported any more ... - Implement new "METADATA" command which can be used by remote servers and IRC services to update client metadata like the client info text ("real name"), user name, and hostname, and use this command to configure an cloaked hostname (user mode "+x") on remote servers: This prevents "double cloaking" of hostnames and even cloaked hostnames are in sync on all servers supporting "METADATA" now. - Implement new IRC "SVSNICK" command to allow remote servers (and IRC services) to change nicknames of already registered users. The SVSNICK command itself doesn't change the nickname, but it becomes forwarded to the server to which the user is connected to. And then this server initiates the real nickname changing using regular NICK commands. This allows to run mixed networks with old servers not supporting the SVSNICK command, because SVSNICK commands for nicknames on such servers are silently ignored and don't cause a desynchronization of the network. - New configuration option "MaxListSize" to configure the maximum number of channels returned by a LIST command. The default is 100, as before. - Implement user mode "b", "block messages": when a user has set mode "b", all private messages and notices to this user are blocked if they don't originate from a registered user, an IRC Op, server or service. The originator gets an error numeric sent back in this case, ERR\_NONONREG\_MSG (486), which is used by UnrealIRCd, too. (Closes #144) - Implement channel mode "V" (invite disallow): If the new channel mode "V" is set, the INVITE command becomes invalid and all clients get the new ERR\_NOINVITE\_MSG (518) reply. (Closes #143) - Implement channel mode "Q" and user mode "q": Both modes protect users from channel kicks: only IRC operators and servers can kick users having mode "q" or in channels with mode "Q". (Closes #141) - Allow users to "cloak" their hostname only when the configuration variable "CloakHostModeX" (introduced in 19.2) is set. Otherwise, only IRC operators, other servers, and services are allowed to set the user mode "+x": this prevents regular users from changing their hostmask to the name of the IRC server itself, which confused quite a few people ;-) (Closes #133) - New configuration option "OperChanPAutoOp": If disabled, IRC operators don't become channel operators in persistent channels when joining. Enabled by default, which has been the behavior of ngIRCd up to this patch. (Closes #135) - Allow IRC operators to see secret (+s) channels in LIST command as long as the "MorePrivacy" configuration option isn't enabled in the configuration file. (Closes #136) - Implement new (optional) IRC+ "CHARCONV" command to set a client character set that the server translates all messages to/from UTF-8. This feature requires the "libiconv" library and must be enabled using the new "--with-iconv" option of the ./configure script. See doc/Protocol.txt for details. (Closes #109) - Implement user mode "B" ("Bot flag"): it is settable and unsettable by every (non-restricted) client. This is how Unreal and InspIRCd do behave, and so do we :-) - Implement channel mode "M": Only the server, identified users and IRC operators are able to talk in such a channel. - Block nicknames that are reserved for services and are defined using the configuration variable "ServiceMask" in "Server" blocks; And this variable now can handle more than one mask separated by commas. - Implemented XOP channel user modes: "Half Op" ("+h", prefix "%") can set the channel modes +imntvIbek and kick all +v and normal users; "Admin" ("+a", prefix "&") can set channel modes +imntvIbekoRsz and kick all +o, +h, +v and normal users; and "Owner" ("+q", prefix "~") can set channel modes +imntvIbekoRsz and kick all +a, +o, +h, +v and normal users. - Implement hashed cloaked hostnames for both the "CloakHost" and "CloakHostModeX" configuration options: now the admin can use the new '%x' placeholder to insert a hashed version of the clients hostname, and the new configuration option "CloakHostSalt" defines the salt for the hash function. When "CloakHostSalt" is not set (the default), a random salt will be generated after each server restart.
ngIRCd 19.2 (2012-06-19)
 ngIRCd 19.2~rc1 (2012-06-13) - New configuration option "CloakHostModeX" to configure the hostname that gets used for IRC clients which have user mode "+x" enabled. Up to now, the name of the IRC server itself has been used for this, which still is the default when "CloakHostModeX" isn't set. - Add instructions for setting up Atheme IRC services. - Implement support for IRC capability handling, the new "CAP" command, and capability "multi-prefix" which allows both the NAME and WHO command handlers to return more than one "class prefix" to the client.
ngIRCd 19.1 (2012-03-19)
 - Really include \_all\_ patches to build the Anope module into the distribution archive ... ooops!
ngIRCd 19 (2012-02-29)
 ngIRCd 19~rc1 (2012-02-12) - Update preliminary ngIRCd protocol module for Anope 1.9.6, which now is the only supported version. - New numeric RPL\_WHOISHOST\_MSG(378), which returns the DNS host name (if available) and the IP address of a client in the WHOIS reply. Only the user itself and local IRC operators get this numeric. - Implement channel exception list (mode 'e'). This allows a channel operator to define exception masks that allow users to join the channel even when a "ban" would match and prevent them from joining: the exception list (e) overrides the ban list (b). - Implement user mode 'C': If the target user of a PRIVMSG or NOTICE command has the user mode 'C' set, it is required that both sender and receiver are on the same channel. This prevents private flooding by completely unknown clients. - New RPL\_WHOISREGNICK\_MSG(307) numeric in WHOIS command replies: it indicates if a nickname is registered (if user mode 'R' set). - Limit channel invite, ban, and exception lists to 50 entries and fix duplicate check and error messages when adding already listed entries or deleting no (longer) existing ones. - Limit the number of list items in the reply of LIST (100), WHO (25), WHOIS (10), and WHOWAS (25) commands. - Limit the MODE command to handle a maximum number of 5 channel modes that require an argument (+Ibkl) per call and report this number in the ISUPPORT(005) numeric: "MODES=5". - LINKS command: support <mask> parameter to limit the reply. - Add 1 second penalty for every further target on PRIVMSG/NOTICE commands: this reduces the possibility of flooding channels with commands like "PRIVMSG/NOTICE #a,#n,#c,... :message" a little bit. Problem noticed by Cahata, thanks! - New configuration option "PAMIsOptional": when set, clients not sending a password are still allowed to connect: they won't become "identified" and keep the "~" character prepended to their supplied user name. See "man 5 ngircd.conf" for details. - Fixed handling of WHO commands. This fixes two bugs: "WHO <nick>" returned nothing at all if the user was "+i" (reported by Cahata, thanks) and "WHO <nick|nickmask>" returned channel names instead of "\*" when the user was member of a (visible) channel. - LUSERS reply: only count channels that are visible to the requesting client, so the existence of secret channels is no longer revealed by using LUSERS. Reported by Cahata, thanks! - Unknown user and channel modes no longer stop the mode parser, but are simply ignored. Therefore modes after the unknown one are now handled. This is how ircd2.10/ircd2.11/ircd-seven behave, at least. Reported by Cahata, thanks! - Implement IRC commands "GLINE" and "KLINE" to ban users. G-Lines are synchronized between server on peering, K-Lines are local only. If you use "\*!<user>@<host>" or "\*!\*@<host>" masks, these connections are blocked even before the user is fully logged in (before PASS, NICK, and USER commands have been processed) and before the child processes for authentication are forked, so resource usage is smaller. - Added doc/Modes.txt: document modes supported by ngIRCd. - Implement user mode "R": indicates that the nickname of this user is "registered". This mode isn't handled by ngIRCd itself, but must be set and unset by IRC services like Anope. - Implement channel mode "R": only registered users (having the user mode "R" set) are allowed to join this channel. - Test suite: bind to loopback (127.0.0.1) interface only. - Handle unknown user and channel modes: these modes are saved and forwarded to other servers, but ignored otherwise. - Handle channel user modes 'a', 'h', and 'q' from remote servers. These channel user modes aren't used for anything at the moment, but ngIRCd knows that these three modes are "channel user modes" and not "channel modes", that is that these modes take an "nickname" argument. Like unknown user and channel modes, these modes are saved and forwarded to other servers, but ignored otherwise.
ngIRCd 18 (2011-07-10)
 - Add preliminary ngIRCd protocol module for Anope 1.9 to contrib/Anope/.
 ngIRCd 18~rc2 (2011-06-29) - GnuTLS: use 1024 bits as minimum size of the DH prime. This enables ngIRCd to accept incoming connections from other servers and clients that "only" use at least 1024 bits again, like ngIRCd 17 did (and no longer requires 2048 bits for incoming connections).
 ngIRCd 18~rc1 (2011-06-27) - New configuration option "MorePrivacy" to "censor" some user information. When enabled, signon time and idle time is left out. Part and quit messages are made to look the same. WHOWAS requests are silently dropped. All of this is useful if one wish to conceal users that access the ngircd servers from TOR or I2P. - New configuration option "ScrubCTCP" to scrub incoming CTCP commands. If activated, the server silently drops incoming CTCP requests from both other servers and from users. The server that scrubs CTCP will not forward the CTCP requests to other servers in the network either, which can spell trouble if not every oper knows about the CTCP-scrubbing. Scrubbing CTCP commands also means that it is not possible to send files between users. There is one exception to the CTCP scrubbing performed: ACTION ("/me commands") requests are not scrubbed. - Restructure ngIRCd configuration file: introduce new [Limits], [Options], and [SSL] sections. The intention of this restructuring is to make the [Global] section much cleaner, so that it only contains variables that most installations must adjust to the local requirements. All the optional variables are moved to [Limits], for configurable limits and timers of ngIRCd, and [Options], for optional features. All SSL-related variables are moved to [SSL] and the "SSL"-prefix is stripped. The old variables in the [Global] section are deprecated now, but are still recognized. => Don't forget to check your configuration, use "ngircd --configtest"! - New documentation "how to contribute": doc/Contributing.txt. - Avoid needlessly scary 'buffer overflow' messages: When the write buffer space grows too large, ngIRCd has to disconnect the client to avoid wasting too much memory, which is logged with a scary 'write buffer overflow' message. Change this to a more descriptive wording. - New configuration option "RequireAuthPing": PING-PONG on login. When enabled, this configuration option lets ngIRCd send a PING with an numeric "token" to clients logging in; and it will not become registered in the network until the client responds with the correct PONG. - New configuration option "NoticeAuth": send NOTICE AUTH on connect. When active, ngircd will send "NOTICE AUTH" messages on client connect time like e.g. snircd (QuakeNet) does. - Add support for up to 3 targets in WHOIS queries, also allow up to one wildcard query from local hosts. Follows ircd 2.10 implementation rather than RFC 2812. At most 10 entries are returned per wildcard expansion. - ngircd.conf(5) manual page: describe types of configuration variables (booleans, text strings, integer numbers) and add type information to each variable description. - Terminate incoming connections on HTTP commands "GET" and "POST". - New configuration option "CloakHost": when set, this host name is used for every client instead of the real DNS host name (or IP address). - New configuration option "CloakUserToNick": when enabled, ngIRCd sets every clients' user name to their nickname and hides the user name supplied by the IRC client. - Make write buffers bigger, but flush early. Before this change, a client got disconnected if the buffer flushing at 4k failed, now regular clients can store up to 32k and servers up 64k even if flushing is not possible at the moment. This enhances reliability on slow links. - Allow "Port = 0" in [Server] blocks. Port number 0 marks remote servers that try to connect to this daemon, but where this daemon never tries to establish a connection on its own: only incoming connections are allowed. - Enable WHOIS command to return information about services. - Implement channel mode 'O': "IRC operators only". This channel mode is used on DALnet (bahamut), for example. - Remove support for ZeroConf/Bonjour/Rendezvous service registration including the "[No]ZeroConf" configuration option. - Deprecate NoXX-Options in ngircd.conf and move new variants into our new [Options] section: 'NoDNS=no' => 'DNS=yes', 'NoIdent=no' => 'Ident=yes', 'NoPAM=no' => 'PAM=yes', and 'NoZeroConf=no' => 'ZeroConf=yes' (and vice-versa). The defaults are adjusted accordingly and the old variables in [Global] are still accepted, so there is no functional change.
ngIRCd 17.1 (2010-12-19)
 - Don't log critical (or worse) messages to stderr - Remove "error file" when compiled with debug code enabled - New numeric 329: get channel creation time on "MODE #chan" commands
ngIRCd 17 (2010-11-07)
 - doc: change path names in sample-ngircd.conf depending on sysconfdir
 ngIRCd 17~rc2 (2010-10-25) - Generate ngIRCd version number from GIT tag. - Make source code compatible with ansi2knr again. This allows to compile ngIRCd using a pre-ANSI K&R C compiler again.
 ngIRCd 17~rc1 (2010-10-11) - New configuration option "NoZeroConf" to disable service registration at runtime even if ngIRCd is compiled with support for ZeroConf (e.g. using Howl, Avahi or on Mac OS X). - New configuration option "SyslogFacility" to define the syslog "facility" (the "target"), to which ngIRCd should send its log messages. Possible values are system dependent, but most probably "auth", "daemon", "user" and "local1" through "local7" are possible values; see syslog(3). Default is "local5" for historical reasons. - Dump the "internal server state" (configured servers, established connections and known clients) to the console or syslog when receiving the SIGUSR2 signal and debug mode is enabled. - Enable the daemon to disable and enable "debug mode" on runtime using signal SIGUSR1, when debug code is compiled in, not only on startup using the command line parameters. - Implement user mode "x": host name cloaking (closes: #102). - Change MOTD file handling: ngIRCd now caches the contents of the MOTD file, so the daemon now requires a HUP signal or REHASH command to re-read the MOTD file when its content changed. - Allow IRC ops to change channel modes even without OperServerMode set. - Allow IRC operators to use MODE command on any channel (closes: #100). - New configuration option "NoPAM" to disable PAM. - Implement asynchronous user authentication using PAM, please see the file doc/PAM.txt for details. - Add some documentation for using BOPM with ngIRCd, see doc/Bopm.txt. - Implement user mode "c": receive connect/disconnect NOTICEs. Note that this new mode requires the user to be an IRC operator. - Show SSL status in WHOIS output, numeric 275.
ngIRCd 16 (2010-05-02)
 ngIRCd 16~rc2 (2010-04-25) - Enhance connection statistics counters: display total number of served connections on daemon shutdown and when a new client connects using the new numeric RPL\_STATSCONN (250).
 ngIRCd 16~rc1 (2010-03-25) - Implement WEBIRC command used by some Web-IRC frontends. The password required to secure this command must be configured using the new "WebircPassword" variable in the ngircd.conf file. - Remove limit on max number of configured irc operators. - A new channel mode "secure connections only" (+z) has been implemented: Only clients using a SSL encrypted connection to the server are allowed to join such a channel. But please note three things: a) already joined clients are not checked when setting this mode, b) IRC operators are always allowed to join every channel, and c) remote clients using a server not supporting this mode are not checked either and therefore always allowed to join.
ngIRCd 15 (2009-11-07)
 ngIRCd 15~rc1 (2009-10-15) - Do not add default listening port (6667) if SSL ports were specified, so ngIRCd can be configured to only accept SSL-encrypted connections now. - Enable IRC operators to use the IRC command SQUIT (instead of the already implemented but non-standard DISCONNECT command). - New configuration option "AllowRemoteOper" (disabled by default) that enables remote IRC operators to use the IRC commands SQUIT and CONNECT on the local server. - Enforce upper limit on maximum number of handled commands. This implements a throttling scheme: an IRC client can send up to 3 commands or 256 bytes per second before a one second pause is enforced.
ngIRCd 14.1 (2009-05-05)
 - Security: fix remotely triggerable crash in SSL/TLS code. - Debian: build ngircd-full-dbg package. - Allow ping timeout quit messages to show the timeout value.
ngIRCd 14 (2009-04-20)
 ngIRCd 14~rc1 (2009-03-29) - Allow creation of persistent modeless channels. - The INFO command reports the compile time now (if available). - Support individual channel keys for pre-defined channels: introduce new configuration variable "KeyFile" in [Channel] sections in ngircd.conf, here a file can be configured for each pre-defined channel which contains individual channel keys for different users. - Remove limit on maximum number of predefined channels in ngircd.conf.
ngIRCd 13 (2008-12-25)
 ngIRCd 13~rc1 (2008-11-21): - New version number scheme :-) - Initial support for IRC services, using a RFC1459 style interface, tested with IRCServices (http://www.ircservices.za.net/) version 5.1.13. For this to work, ngIRCd now supports server-server links conforming to RFC 1459. New ngircd.conf(5) option: ServiceMask. - Support for SSL-encrypted server-server and client-server links using OpenSSL (configure: --with-openssl) or GNUTLS (configure: --with-gnutls). New ngircd.conf(5) options: SSLPorts, SSLKeyFile, SSLKeyFilePassword, SSLCertFile, SSLDHFile, and SSLConnect. - Server local channels have been implemented, prefix "&", that are only visible to users of the same server and are not visible in the network. In addition ngIRCd creates a "special" channel &SERVER on startup and logs all the messages to it that a user with mode +s receives. - New make target "osxpkg" to build a Mac OS X installer package. - New configuration option "NoIdent" to disable IDENT lookups even if the daemon is compiled with IDENT support.
ngIRCd 0.12.1 (2008-07-09)
 - Add option aliases -V (for --version) and -h (for --help). - Make Listen parameter a comma-separated list of addresses. This also obsoletes ListenIPv4 and ListenIPv6 options. If Listen is unset, it is treated as Listen="::,0.0.0.0". Note: ListenIPv4 and ListenIPv6 options are still recognized, but ngircd will print a warning if they are used in the config file.
ngIRCd 0.12.0 (2008-05-13)
 ngIRCd 0.12.0-pre2 (2008-04-29) - IPv6: Add config options to disable ipv4/ipv6 support.
 ngIRCd 0.12.0-pre1 (2008-04-20) - Add IPv6 support. - Install a LaunchDaemon script to start/stop ngIRCd on Mac OS X. - Implemented IRC commands INFO, SUMMON (dummy), and USERS (dummy) and enhanced test suite to check these commands. (Dana Dahlstrom) - IRC\_WHO now supports search patterns and will test this against user nickname/server name/host name, etc. as required by RFC 2812, Section 3.6.1. (reported by Dana Dahlstrom) - Implement RFC 2812 handling of "0" argument to 'JOIN': must be treated as if the user had sent PART commands for all channels the user is a member of. (Dana Dahlstrom) - Allow NOTICEs to be sent to a channel. (Fabian Schlager)
ngIRCd 0.11.0 (2008-01-15)
 - Add support for /STAT u (server uptime) command. - New [Server] configuration Option "Bind" allows to specify the source IP address to use when connecting to remote server. - New configuration option "MaxNickLength" to specify the allowed maximum length of user nicknames. Note: must be unique in an IRC network! - Numeric 317: implemented "signon time" (displayed in WHOIS result). - Added new server configuration option "Passive" for "Server" blocks to disable automatic outgoing connections (similar to -p option to ngircd, but only for the specified server). (Tassilo Schweyer) - Added support for the WALLOPS command. Usage is restricted to IRC operators.
ngIRCd 0.10.2 (2007-06-08)
 - Predefined channel configuration now allows specification of channel key (mode k) and maximum user count (mode l): variables "Key" and "MaxUsers". - When using the epoll() IO interface, compile in the select() interface as well and fall back to it when epoll() isn't available on runtime. - Added support for IO APIs "poll()" and "/dev/poll".
ngIRCd 0.10.1 (2006-12-17)
 - Allow PASS syntax defined in RFC 1459 for server links, too. - New configuration option "PredefChannelsOnly": if set, clients can only join predefined channels.
ngIRCd 0.10.0 (2006-10-01)
 ngIRCd 0.10.0-pre1 (2006-08-02) - Enhanced DIE to accept a single parameter ("comment text") which is sent to all locally connected clients before the server goes down. - JOIN now supports more than one channel key at a time. - Implemented numeric "333": Time and user name who set a channel topic. - Channel topics are no longer limited to 127 characters: now the only limit is the maximum length of an IRC command, i. e. 512 bytes (in practice, this limits the topic to about 490 characters due to protocol overhead). - Reverse DNS lookup code now checks the result by doing an additional lookup to prevent spoofing. - Added new IO layer which (optionally) supports epoll() and kqueue() in addition to the select() interface.
ngIRCd 0.9.0 (2005-07-24)
 - Never run with root privileges but always switch the user ID. - Make "netsplit" messages RFC compliant. - Implemented the IRC function "WHOWAS". - New configuration option "OperServerMode" to enable a workaround needed when running an network with ircd2 servers and "OperCanUseMode" enabled to prevent the ircd2 daemon to drop mode changes of IRC operators. Patch by Florian Westphal, <westphal@foo.fh-furtwangen.de>. - Implemented support for "secret channels" (channel mode "s"). - New configuration option "Mask" for [Operator] sections to limit OPER commands to users with a specific IRC mask. Patch from Florian Westphal. - New configuration variable "PidFile", section "[Global]": if defined, the server writes its process ID (PID) to this file. Default: off. Idea of Florian Westphal, <westphal@foo.fh-furtwangen.de>. - Added support for the Howl (http://www.porchdogsoft.com/products/howl/) Rendezvous API, in addition to the API of Apple (Mac OS X). The available API will be autodetected when you call "./configure --with-rendezvous".
ngIRCd 0.8.0 (2004-06-26)
 - Two new configuration options: "ChrootDir" and "MotdPhrase", thanks to Benjamin Pineau <ben@zouh.org>. Now you can force the daemon to change its root and working directory to something "safe". MotdPhrase is used to define an "MOTD string" instead of a whole file, useful if the "real" MOTD file would be outside the "jail". - INVITE- and BAN-lists become synchronized between IRC+ servers when establishing new connections, if the peer supports this as well. - The type of service (TOS) of all sockets is set to "interactive" now. - Added short command line option "-t" as alternative to "--configtest". - Added optional support for "IDENT" lookups on incoming connections. You have to enable this function with the ./configure switch "--with-ident". The default is not to do IDENT lookups.
ngIRCd 0.7.5 (2003-07-11)
 - New configuration variable "MaxConnectionsIP" to limit the number of simultaneous connections from a single IP that the server will accept. This configuration options lowers the risk of denial of service attacks (DoS), the default is 5 connections per client IP. - Added new configuration variable "Listen" to bind all listening sockets of the server to a single IP address.
ngIRCd 0.7.1 (2003-07-18)
 - Added support for GNU/Hurd.
ngIRCd 0.7.0 (2003-05-01)
 - New command CONNECT to enable and add server links. The syntax is not RFC-compatible: use "CONNECT <name> <port>" to enable and connect an configured server and "CONNECT <name> <port> <host> <mypwd> <peerpwd>" to add a new server (ngIRCd tries to connect new servers only once!). - Added DISCONNECT command ("DISCONNECT <name>") to disable servers. - New command TRACE (you can trace only servers at the moment). - New command HELP that lists all understood commands. - ngIRCd can register itself with Rendezvous: to enable support pass the new switch "--with-rendezvous" to configure. - Added support for TCP Wrappers library: pass "--with-tcp-wrappers" to configure to enable it. - Changed some configure options to use "--with"/"--without" as prefix instead of "--enable"/"--disable": "--without-syslog", "--without-zlib", "--with-tcp-wrappers", and "--with-rendezvous". - Enhanced manual pages ngircd(8) and ngircd.conf(5). - Documentation is now installed in $(datadir)/doc/ngircd.
Older news (sorry, only available in German language):
ngIRCd 0.6.0, 24.12.2002
 - beim Schliessen einer Verbindung zeigt der Server nun vor dem ERROR noch eine Statistik ueber die empfangene und gesendete Datenmenge an. - Connection-Strukturen werden nun "pool-weise" verwaltet; der Pool wird bei Bedarf bis zu einem konfigurierten Limit vergroessert. - Mit der neuen Konfigurationsvariable "MaxConnections" (Sekion "Global") kann die maximale Anzahl gleichzeitiger Verbindungen begrenzt werden. Der Default ist -1, "unlimitiert". - der Server erkennt nun, ob bereits eine eingehende Verbindung von einem Peer-Server besteht und versucht dann nicht mehr, selber eine eigene ausgehende Verbindung zu diesem auufzubauen. Dadurch kann nun auf beiden Servern in der Konfiguration ein Port fuer den Connect konfiguriert werden (beide Server versuchen sich dann gegenseitig zu connectieren). - Server identifizieren sich nun mit asynchronen Passwoertern, d.h. das Passwort, welches A an B schickt, kann ein anderes sein als das, welches B als Antwort an A sendet. In der Konfig.-Datei, Abschnitt "Server", wurde "Password" dazu durch "MyPassword" und "PeerPassword" ersetzt. - Der Server kann nun zur Laufzeit die Konfiguration neu einlesen: dies macht er nach dem Befehl REHASH oder wenn ein HUP-Signal empfangen wird. - Server-Server-Links koennen nun komprimiert werden, dazu wird die zlib (www.zlib.org) benoetigt. Unterstuetzt die Gegenseite die Komprimierung[View remainder of file in raw view](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd/raw/refs/heads/master/NEWS)
