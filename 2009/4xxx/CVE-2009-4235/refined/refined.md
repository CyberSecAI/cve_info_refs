{
  "CVE-2009-4235": {
    "Root cause": "The acpid daemon creates its log file with weak permissions due to a missing mode argument in the open() call with the O_CREAT flag and an unrestrictive umask(0).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing mode argument in open() call when creating a log file with O_CREAT.",
      "Unrestrictive umask(0) setting."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user might be able to read sensitive information from the log file or consume all free disk space by overwriting it, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system where acpid is running.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "A local user account is required to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "Additional Details": "The issue was introduced by a Red Hat patch (acpid-1.0.4-fd.patch) in RHEL 5.3. This patch removed the mode argument from the open() call for /dev/null, which indirectly affected the subsequent open() call for the log file by not passing the mode.  The umask(0) in daemonize() function also contributes to the problem."
