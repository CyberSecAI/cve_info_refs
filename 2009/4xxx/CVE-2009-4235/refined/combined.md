Debian Security Advisory DSA-1960-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Raphael Geissert
December 19, 2009                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : acpid
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2009-4235

It was discovered that acpid, the Advanced Configuration and Power
Interface event daemon, on the oldstable distribution (etch) creates
its log file with weak permissions, which might expose sensible
information or might be abused by a local user to consume all free disk
space on the same partition of the file.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-5etch2.

The stable distribution (lenny) in version 1.0.8-1lenny2 and the
unstable distribution (sid) in version 1.0.10-5, have been updated to
fix the weak file permissions of the log file created by older
versions.

We recommend that you upgrade your acpid packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=542926#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-12-01 08:47:55 UTC  ``` It was reported that acpid version shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (1.0.4) creates its log file (/var/log/acpid) with incorrect permissions, on some platforms, even with random permissions.  Original report:    [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=515062](show_bug.cgi?id=515062 "CLOSED ERRATA - /var/log/acpid has improper permissions")  Problem was caused by the missing 3rd argument to open() when called with O_CREAT flag.  As a result, log file may end up being world writeable and with setuid / setgid bit set, possibly allowing privilege escalation.  This issue does not affect current acpid versions (1.0.6 and later), as they use syslog() logging.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=542926#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2009-12-01 08:53:08 UTC  ``` This problem is not reproducible on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (acpid 1.0.3) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 (acpid 1.0.2), log is always created with 640 permissions.  Checking the differences between 1.0.3 and 1.0.4, 1.0.3 does this in the open_logs() function:    413 	nullfd = open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY, 0640);   414 	if (nullfd < 0) {   ...   418 	}   419 	logfd = open(logfile, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND);  While 1.0.4 no longer passes mode to the first open call (where it's ignore, but it also causes second open to see that mode too):    429 	nullfd = open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY);   430 	if (nullfd < 0) {   ...   434 	}   435 	logfd = open(logfile, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND);   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=542926#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2009-12-01 15:02:52 UTC  ``` Marc Deslauriers pointed out that missing mode argument in /dev/null open call is not from upstream 1.0.4 source, but rather a change from Red Hat patch acpid-1.0.4-fd.patch.  That patch was introduced in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 update package acpid-1.0.4-7.el5:    <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2009-0091.html>  Log files created by previous version of acpid does not get random permissions.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=542926#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-07 17:11:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1642 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1642.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=542926#c6)  Stephan Wiesand    2009-12-09 08:28:45 UTC  ``` The trigger in the updated package is broken:  triggerin scriptlet (using /bin/sh) -- acpid <= 1.0.4-9.el5_4.1 [ -f /var/log/acpid ] && chmod 0644 /var/log/acpid*  If acpid is installed but never ran, /var/log/acpid does not exist, the trigger fails, the transaction is aborted, the system is left with two instances of acpid, ...   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=542926#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-12-09 09:53:17 UTC  ``` Hi Stephan,    thank you for reporting this deficiency to us.  Could you please open a new Red Hat Bugzilla entry for this acpid problem in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 against 5.5 version, so it could be addressed there?  Please note, this Bugzilla record is dedicated only for the acpid [CVE-2009-4033](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4033) security issue (assuming the above mentioned problem was present also in versions of acpid package prior to 1.0.4-9.el5_4.1).  Thanks, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=542926#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-12-09 10:17:05 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures also assigned an identifier [CVE-2009-4235](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4235) to the following acpid vulnerability:  acpid 1.0.4 sets an unrestrictive umask, which might allow local users to leverage weak permissions on /var/log/acpid, and obtain sensitive information by reading this file or cause a denial of service by overwriting this file, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2009-4033](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4033).

The new bug is #545760.  Regards,   Stephan   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=542926#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2009-12-15 12:11:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=542926#c8)) > Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures also assigned an identifier [CVE-2009-4235](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4235) > to the following acpid vulnerability: >  > acpid 1.0.4 sets an unrestrictive umask, which might allow local users > to leverage weak permissions on /var/log/acpid, and obtain sensitive > information by reading this file or cause a denial of service by > overwriting this file, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2009-4033](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4033).  It seems that this extra CVE was assigned based on the following comment:    [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=515062#c8](show_bug.cgi?id=515062#c8 "CLOSED ERRATA - /var/log/acpid has improper permissions")  However, the mentioned umask(0) does not need to be called a separate security issue, IMO.  The real problem here was a missing mode argument to open() call with O_CREAT.  More restrictive umask could have prevented it, but it's not required to fix it.  If sane mode is passed to open(), umask set by a calling process can only make file permissions more restrictive.  As noted in [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=542926#c1), umask(0) was not a problem in versions without acpid-1.0.4-fd.patch patch, as mode 0640 from previous open() call was "re-used", resulting in safe file permissions.  Therefore, I view [CVE-2009-4235](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4235) as duplicate of [CVE-2009-4033](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4033), rather than a different issue.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=515062#c0)  David Tonhofer    2009-08-01 15:21:17 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  /var/log/acpid has permissions "---------x", which seems peculiar.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  acpid-1.0.4-7.el5_3.1  How reproducible:  Seen on fresh install of RHEL 5.3   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=515062#c1)  Jim    2009-08-20 15:58:21 UTC  ``` This also effects installations upgraded from earlier releases when the acpid service recreates the log file.  If you remove /var/log/acpid, and restart the daemon, you get seemingly random modes. I got the following in 4 tests:  -r-s-wsr-x --w---s-wx -r-------t -rwS--S-wT   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=515062#c2)  Jim    2009-08-20 16:32:36 UTC  ``` On a new system (32bit), a trace of acpid shows that the log file is created withe the system call:   open("/var/log/acpid", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND, 01) which creates the '"---------x" mode seen by the OP.  On my existing 64bit system, the system call looks like the following from 4 consecutive tests:  open("/var/log/acpid", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND, 0152316360077060374) open("/var/log/acpid", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND, 0152320420362545134) open("/var/log/acpid", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND, 0152321314513500615) open("/var/log/acpid", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND, 0152325150212171456)   The open() call in acpid.c looks normal though line 445:     logfd = open(logfile, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND);   not sure what's going on here   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=515062#c3)  Jim    2009-08-20 17:37:52 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=515062#c2)) > The open() call in acpid.c looks normal though > line 445: >     logfd = open(logfile, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND); >  > not sure what's going on here    Oh, that's the answer right there. File mode *must* be specified when the O_CREATE flag is used.  test patch:  diff --git a/acpid.c b/acpid.c index c16cf0d..e35ce43 100644 --- a/acpid.c +++ b/acpid.c @@ -432,7 +432,7 @@ open_logs(void)                         "/dev/null", strerror(errno));                 return -1;         } -       logfd = open(logfile, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND); +       logfd = open(logfile, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND, S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR|S_IRGRP);         if (logfd < 0) {                 fprintf(stderr, "%s: can't open %s: %s\n", progname,                          logfile, strerror(errno));   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=515062#c7)  Vincent Danen    2009-11-04 20:57:32 UTC  ``` This looks like it might be specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  On 3/x86_64 (exclusivearch excludes x86), I get 0640 permissions each time on 25 iterations of a test, and likewise with 4 (both 32bit and 64bit).  On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 32bit, on 25 iterations, permissions were always 0001, whereas on 64bit they were all over the place as noted in #c1.  Used the following to test:  % cat acpid-test.sh  #!/bin/sh for in in `seq 1 25` do     rm -f /var/log/acpid >/dev/null 2>&1     service acpid restart >/dev/null 2>&1     ls -al /var/log/acpid done  Looking at the code, however, shows the same open() call, so it's nothing in the code that is making this difference.  Could there be a difference in the way open() is implemented between EL5 and EL4?  Perhaps some change to glibc?  At any rate, this does not seem to affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or 4, just 5.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=515062#c8)  Vincent Danen    2009-11-04 22:25:30 UTC  ``` The issue is also in the daemonize() function.  It calls umask(0) when there really is no need for it.  Removing umask(0) in addition to the permission changes noted in the patch in #c3 corrects the issue.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=515062#c10)  RHEL Program Management    2009-11-06 19:04:10 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion, but this component is not scheduled to be updated in the current Red Hat Enterprise Linux release. If you would like this request to be reviewed for the next minor release, ask your support representative to set the next rhel-x.y flag to "?".   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=515062#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-07 17:11:19 UTC  ``` An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on therefore solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.
