{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the 'detail.php' script. Specifically, the 'id' parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper escaping.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the 'detail.php' script.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure (such as user credentials), data modification, or even complete database compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the 'detail.php' script, specifically by manipulating the 'id' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges or authenticated access is required."
