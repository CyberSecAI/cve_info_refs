```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter within `portfolio_genre.php` and `news_id.php`.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data corruption, or complete system compromise.
- Attack vectors:  The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests by injecting malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter of `portfolio_genre.php` and `news_id.php` pages.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable web pages. No authentication or special privileges are explicitly mentioned.
