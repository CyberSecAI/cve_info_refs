  "cveId": "CVE-2009-4032",
  "related": true,
  "info": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in Cacti 0.8.7e and earlier. The vulnerabilities stem from a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content. Specifically, the flaws are present in (1) graph.php, (2) include/top_graph_header.php, (3) lib/html_form.php, and (4) lib/timespan_settings.php. Some specific vulnerable parameters are (a) graph.php's graph_end parameter (b) graph.php's graph_start parameter (c) graph_view.php's date1 parameter when action=tree (d) graph_settings.php's page_refresh parameter (e) graph_settings.php's default_dual_pane_width parameter. \n\nThese vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This can lead to the execution of attacker-supplied HTML and script code within the context of the affected browser. This could allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or control how the site is rendered to the user, among other potential attacks.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of exploitation includes arbitrary script execution within the user's browser, potentially leading to:\n- Stealing of cookie-based authentication credentials\n- Control over how the site is rendered to the user.\n- Other possible attacks that can be performed via script execution.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests with malicious inputs to vulnerable parameters. The vulnerable parameters are found in the following files:\n   - graph.php\n   - include/top_graph_header.php\n   - lib/html_form.php\n   - lib/timespan_settings.php"

    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Cacti application to exploit this vulnerability.",
