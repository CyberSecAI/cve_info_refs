Subject: CVE Request - Cacti - 0.8.7e

Hello vendors,

   Moritz Naumann reported multiple cross-site scripting flaws in
recent version of Cacti.

References:
-----------
<http://www.cacti.net/download_patches.php>
<http://docs.cacti.net/#cross-site_scripting_fixes>
<http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/37109/info>
<http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=294573>

Upstream patch:
---------------
<http://www.cacti.net/downloads/patches/0.8.7e/cross_site_fix.patch>

Looks like this is different issue than CVE-2008-0783, CVE-2008-0785
and CVE-2008-0786 were.

Could you allocate a CVE id?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

| [Description](#c0)  Peter Volkov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-25 11:13:22 UTC  ``` Cacti is prone to multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.  Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.  Cacti 0.8.7e is vulnerable; other versions may be affected as well.   <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/37109>  New version is in the tree. Arch teams, please, stabilize. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Brent Baude (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-25 19:33:55 UTC  ``` ppc64 done ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-26 10:46:07 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tobias Klausmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-29 14:41:39 UTC  ``` Stable on alpha. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2009-11-30 10:47:20 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Alex Legler (RETIRED)   archtester gentoo-dev Security  2009-11-30 18:58:08 UTC  ``` CVE-2009-4032 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2009-4032>):   Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Cacti 0.8.7e   allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via   vectors related to (1) graph.php, (2) include/top_graph_header.php,   (3) lib/html_form.php, and (4) lib/timespan_settings.php.   ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Alex Legler (RETIRED)   archtester gentoo-dev Security  2009-12-03 09:17:15 UTC  ``` CVE-2009-4112 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2009-4112>):   Cacti 0.8.7e and earlier allows remote authenticated administrators   to gain privileges by modifying the "Data Input Method" for the   "Linux - Get Memory Usage" setting to contain arbitrary commands.   ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-12-09 18:51:33 UTC  ``` sparc stable ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-12-20 16:59:48 UTC  ``` Stable for PPC. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2009-12-21 00:21:42 UTC  ``` All arches done.

It's 4 XSS issues (one of them persistent) and 1 priviledge escalation
issue. An advisory is coming to a full disclosure mailing list near you
any minute.

If there's a way I can make things easier for you in the future please
let me know.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# JVN#09758120 Cacti vulnerable to cross-site scripting

## Overview

Cacti contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

## Products Affected

* Cacti 0.8.7e and earlier

## Description

Cacti is a web application that graphs stored data collected from network devices. Cacti contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability ([CWE-79](//cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)) due to a flaw in processing parameters in graph\_view.php.

## Impact

If a user views a malicious page while logged in, an arbitrary script may be executed on the user's web browser.

## Solution

**Update the software**

Update to the latest version according to the information provided by the developer.

According to the developer, this issue was addressed in 0.8.7f released in 2010.

## References

## JPCERT/CC Addendum

This JVN publication was delayed to 2015/07/09 after the developer fix was developed. From the fiscal year 2011, JPCERT/CC is using a new vendor coordination procedure. This new procedure came from the recommendation of the fiscal year 2010 "Study Group on Information System Vulnerability Handling" aimed at more timely JVN publications.

## Vulnerability Analysis by JPCERT/CC

**Analyzed on 2015.07.09 (CVSS Base Metrics)**

[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | Specialized access conditions exist. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the confidentiality of the system. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
