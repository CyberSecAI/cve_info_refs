Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4437:

**Summary:**

The provided content describes a blind SQL injection vulnerability in Active Auction House version 3.6.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input within the `wishlist.asp` script, specifically the `catid` parameter. The application fails to sanitize this input, allowing attackers to inject SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not directly display the results of the injected SQL query, forcing the attacker to infer information based on the application's behavior. This makes exploitation more difficult but still possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker may be able to modify or delete data in the database depending on the database user's permissions.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** An attacker could potentially use this as a jumping off point for further compromise of the server or infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted GET request to `wishlist.asp` with a malicious `catid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious SQL injection payloads.
*   **Understanding of blind SQL injection techniques:** The attacker must be able to use techniques to extract information despite the lack of direct SQL output.
*   **No Prior Authentication Required:** The provided exploit does not require authentication

**Technical Details:**
The exploit demonstrates how to inject SQL code using the catid parameter in the wishlist.asp file:

`http://server/demoactiveauctionh/wishlist.asp?catid={bL!ND}`

The provided exploit then tests for boolean blind SQL using the following techniques:
`links.asp?linkid=1 and 1=1` (True condition)
`links.asp?linkid=1 and 1=2` (False condition)
These tests are likely being used to establish if the parameter is vulnerable.

This exploit provides specific examples, which would aid an attacker in exploiting the vulnerability.
