Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2009-4013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of control field names and values in lintian before using them in operations. This lack of sanitization also applied to patch system control files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is directory traversal. Because control field names and values are not sanitized before use, a malicious actor could inject crafted input that could traverse directories when processed by lintian. This is a classic path traversal issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** By exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability, an attacker could overwrite arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to system compromise or data loss.
*   **System Information Disclosure:** An attacker might also use the vulnerability to disclose sensitive system information by reading arbitrary files on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted control files. This means that if a user or an automated system were to use `lintian` on a specially crafted set of files containing malicious control field names or values, it would be possible to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide specially crafted input to `lintian`, specifically control files with malicious field names or values. This could be achieved by:
    *   Tricking a user into running `lintian` on a malicious package.
    *   Compromising a system or process that uses `lintian` as part of automated workflows.

**Summary**
CVE-2009-4013 involves a directory traversal vulnerability in `lintian` due to insufficient sanitization of control file fields, allowing attackers to overwrite files or disclose system information. Exploitation requires crafting malicious control files and having them processed by `lintian`.
