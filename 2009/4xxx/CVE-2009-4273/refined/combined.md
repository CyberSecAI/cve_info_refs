```
The SystemTap team announces release 1.1.

  better support for gcc 4.5 richer DWARF debuginfo, new preprocessor
  conditional for kernel 'CONFIG_*' testing, improved (experimental)
  unprivileged user support, new tapsets, better local-vs-global
  variable warnings, better return codes, bug fixes, and more...

= Where to get it

  <http://sourceware.org/systemtap/> - our project page
  <http://sourceware.org/systemtap/ftp/releases/systemtap-1.1.tar.gz>
  <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=615>
  git tag release-1.1 (commit FIXME)

= How to build it

  See the README and NEWS files at
  <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=systemtap.git;a=tree>
  Further information at <http://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/>

= SystemTap frontend (stap) changes

- Systemtap now warns about global variables being referenced from other
  script files.  This aims to protect against unintended local-vs-global
  namespace collisions such as:

     % cat some_tapset.stp
     probe baz.one = bar { foo = $foo; bar = $bar }
     % cat end_user_script.stp
     global foo # intended to be private variable
     probe timer.s(1) { foo ++ }
     probe baz.* { println(foo, pp()) }
     % stap end_user_script.stp
     WARNING: cross-file global variable reference to foo from
some_tapset.stp

- Better support for richer DWARF debuginfo output from GCC 4.5
  (variable tracking assignments). Kernel modules are now always resolved
  against all their dependencies to find any info referring to missing
  symbols. DW_AT_const_value is now supported when no DW_AT_location
  is available.

- Any diagnostic output line that starts with "ERROR", as in
  error("foo"), will promote a "Pass 5: run failed", and the return
  code is 1.

- The loading of signed modules by staprun is no longer allowed for
  ordinary, unprivileged users.  This means that only root, members of
  the group 'stapdev' and members of the group 'stapusr' can load
  systemtap modules using staprun, stap or stap-client.  The minimum
  privilege required to run arbitrary --unprivileged scripts is now
  'stapusr' membership.

- The stap-server initscript is available. This initscript allows you
  to start systemtap compile servers as a system service and to manage
  these servers as a group or individually. The stap-server initscript
  is installed by the systemtap-server rpm.  The build directory for
  the uprobes module (/usr/share/systemtap/runtime/uprobes) is made
  writable by the 'stap-server' group. All of the files generated when
  building the uprobes module, including the digital signature, are
  also writable by members of stap-server.

  See initscript/README.stap-server for details.

- Some of the of the compile server client, server and certificate
  management tools have been moved from $bindir to
  $libexecdir/systemtap.  You should use the new stap-server script or
  the stap-server initscript for server management where possible. The
  stap-server script provides the same functionality as the
  stap-server initscript except that the servers are run by the
  invoking user by default as opposed to servers started by the
  stap-server initscript which are run by the user stap-server by
  default. See stap-server(8) for more information.

  You may continue to use these tools by adding $libexecdir/systemtap
  to your path. You would need to do this, for example, if you are not
  root, you want to start a compile server and you are not running
  systemtap from a private installation. In this case you still need
  to use stap-start-server.

= SystemTap script language changes

- Preprocessor conditional for kernel configuration testing:
  %( CONFIG_foo == "y" %? ... %)

= SystemTap tapset changes

- New tracepoint based tapset for memory subsystem.
- ftrace(msg:string) tapset function to send strings to the system-wide
  ftrace ring-buffer (if any).
- Additional scsi probepoints
- Additional memory probepoints for kernel allocation and freeing.
- Additional ioblock and ioscheduler probepoints.
- Additional scheduler probepoints
- New IRQ and workqueue probepoints.
- New TTY probepoints.
- New task_time tapset to query time usage.
- New proc_mem tapset to query memory usage.

= New script examples

- interrupt/interrupts-by-dev.stp  Tracks interrupts by device
- io/mbrwatch.stp                  Monitors MBR reads/writes
- memory/vm.tracepoints.stp        Tracks memory slab/slub allocations
- network/tcp_trace.stp            Tcp connection tracing utility
- process/plimit.stp               Prints pid resource limits
- profiling/sched_switch.stp       Display scheduler task switches

= Known issues with this release

- When using the systemtap client and server udp port 5353 must be
  open in your firewall in order for the clent to find servers using
  avahi-browse.

- Some kernel crashes continue to be reported when a script probes
  broad kernel function wildcards.

  installed), you should see 1000-1100 passes and a small handful of
  failures.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=11105#c0)  Frank Ch. Eigler    2009-12-18 17:29:00 UTC  ``` stap-server is a shell script that manipulates stap command line arguments in a pretty simple way.  Trouble would occur if these incoming arguments (from a potentially hostile stap-client/user) contain space or other control goo characters that can work their way past stap-server's filtering to the later stap command line. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=11105#c1)  Frank Ch. Eigler    2009-12-22 03:33:51 UTC  ``` Lots of badness hides in the string processing.  Horror cases include   stap-client \; ... stap-client -; ... stap-client -D 'asdf ; ls /etc' ... stap-client -e 'script' -D 'asdf ; \; '  So far I haven't found additional small amounts of quoting, and/or changed eval and such constructs, to make the above not work but keep ordinary scripts (-e '{..}"..."') work.  ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=11105#c2)  Dave Brolley    2009-12-23 15:32:37 UTC  ``` It seems clear that a first and necessary step to solving this is to rework the way the command line information is presented to the server so that it no longer needs to parse and interpret the command line at all. This is true regardless of the future of the client and server as standalone scripts/programs or integrated with stap.  Perhaps something like having each relevant option and its value occupy its own line in a structured file passed to the server from the client. Perhaps something in an option:value format. Some examples:  scriptFile:script file name possibly containing spaces.stp v:2 p:3 unprivileged:  or  e:probe begin { printf ("Hello\n"); exit (); } unprivileged:  This should be easy for the server to internalize for analysis and it should be easy for the server to construct and execute the stap command line.    ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=11105#c3)  Frank Ch. Eigler    2009-12-23 16:06:33 UTC  ``` > scriptFile:script file name possibly containing spaces.stp > v:2 > p:3 > unprivileged: > e:probe begin { printf ("Hello\n"); exit (); } > unprivileged:   Right, this is a good way to start thinking about it, but you need to think even more paranoidly: consider the script containing these lines.  /* e: nothing  m: something */  roland suggested \0 separated transcriptions of stap-client argv[], which would be reliable by nature, but /bin/sh is not good at processing such strings.  ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=11105#c4)  Dave Brolley    2009-12-23 17:07:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=11105#c3))  > Right, this is a good way to start thinking about it, but you need to think > even more paranoidly: consider the script containing these lines. >  > /* > e: nothing  > m: something > */  Of course. It was an example, not a spec  :-) There would still be the required filtering. It would just be a lot easier to perform.  ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=11105#c5)  Frank Ch. Eigler    2009-12-29 20:54:02 UTC  ``` Here's another approach.  Rewrite stap-client and stap-server as small c++ programs that package the args, almost entirely unparsed, into the .zip file. (It could be done in perl, but it would add a new rpm dependency, which is undesirable.)  The new stap-server would invoke stap with a new flag, after which it would transcribe (carefully) all incoming args from the client:  --client-args -e SCRIPT -v  ... blah  Preceding these would be any extra stap flags that were given to stap-start-server (-a ARCH etc.), which we can consider trusted.  Then stap itself would look for --client-args, and proceed to parse both server-side and client-side args together, in good old main.cxx. The logic for rejecting client-side supplied --unprivileged -D / etc. would all be here, instead of stap-server/etc.   Dave, until we choose an approach, I'd like you to concentrate on writing  a good testsuite for this.  It should be in the form of a dejagnu .exp script that creates junk scripts ("fuzzing") and submits them to stap & stap-client, to assert equal outputs.  It should arrange to include special characters like ' ', '\'', '"', '\n', '*', ';', etc. in all the relevant command line options (-e, -I, ...).  ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=11105#c6)  Frank Ch.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-12-23 21:54:37 UTC  ```  A flaw was found in the "stap-server" network compilation server, an optional part of systemtap.  Part of the server is written in bash and does not adequately sanitize its inputs, which are essentially full command line parameter sets from a client.  Remote users may be able to abuse quoting/spacing/metacharacters to execute shell code on behalf of the compile server process/user (normally a fully unprivileged synthetic userid).  There is currently no fix available.  To work-around this issue, avoid running the stap-server program on a network with untrusted users.  [1] <http://sourceware.org/PR11105>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c6)  Vincent Danen    2010-01-15 19:36:23 UTC  ``` This is [CVE-2009-4273](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4273).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c9)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-16 00:31:20 UTC  ``` systemtap-1.1-1.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/systemtap-1.1-1.fc11>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c10)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-16 00:31:25 UTC  ``` systemtap-1.1-1.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/systemtap-1.1-1.fc12>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c11)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-17 02:52:50 UTC  ``` systemtap-1.1-1.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c12)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-17 02:54:58 UTC  ``` systemtap-1.1-1.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c15)  Vincent Danen    2010-01-22 22:44:24 UTC  ``` systemtap 0.6.2 in EL4 does not have server functionality at all and as a result is unaffected by this issue.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c16)  Frank Ch. Eigler    2010-02-03 20:45:43 UTC  ``` We have identified a few additional cases where the fix above is not sufficient. We are working on a workaround that involves only changes to configuration files (rather than compiled code).  Shall we handle this with a whole separate advisory or an update to this one?   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c21)  Vincent Danen    2010-02-04 21:47:21 UTC  ``` Ok, but this doesn't make the [CVE-2009-4273](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4273) fix incomplete, right?  Since this is not due to unsanitized input in a shell script, but rather due to an issue with the Makefile (or how make is run?).  This would probably be considered a separate flaw and would need another CVE if I'm understanding this correctly.  So I wouldn't say the original fix was incomplete, but rather that this is a separate, yet similar, issue (am I correct in assuming that if you fixed this, but _not_ this original issue, that the original issue would still exist?  Or would fixing this _also_ fix the original issue?  That distinction is probably what would decide whether this is a separate CVE or not).   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c22)  Frank Ch. Eigler    2010-02-04 21:52:37 UTC  ``` The 'make' invocation we are talking about is done via the chain stap-server -> stap -> make, at the server at run time.  This is not the 'make' of the software itself, but again, a 'make'  invoked at run time, as a consequence of how systemtap works.  For the original issue, we secured only the first link (stap-server -> stap) to avoid unintentional eval's.  However, this second link (stap -> make) also exists, and make is all too happy to eval just about anything, so we need to sanitize its inputs too.  So yes, it is another instance of the original issue.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c25)  Vincent Danen    2010-02-05 16:44:15 UTC  ``` I've assigned [CVE-2010-0412](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0412) for the "incomplete fix of CVE-2009-4273".  For reference, we do not need to refer to [CVE-2010-0412](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0412) in our advisories since we have not updated systemtap with the incomplete fix.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c27)  Frank Ch. Eigler    2010-02-12 18:26:16 UTC  ``` The tentative additional fixes for this problem are here:  <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=systemtap.git;a=commit;h=c0d1b5a00> <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=systemtap.git;a=commit;h=cc9e5488d>   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c28)  Vincent Danen    2010-02-25 18:28:10 UTC  ``` [CVE-2010-0412](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-0412) has been assigned for the "incomplete fix of CVE-2009-4273".  MITRE unfortunately classified it differently:  stap-server in SystemTap 1.1 does not properly restrict the value of the -B (aka BUILD) option, which allows attackers to have an unspecified impact via vectors associated with executing the make program, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2009-4273](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4273).  They picked this up from Fedora commits which, unfortunately, did not indicate that this isn't a new issue, but that the fix for [CVE-2009-4273](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4273) was incomplete.   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=550172#c29)  errata-xmlrpc    2010-03-01 19:02:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2010:0124 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0124.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- krb5
Specially crafted requests be authenticated remote attackers could
crash the KDC (CVE-2010-1320).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- clamav
Specially crafted CAB archives could crash clamav (CVE-2010-1311) or
bypass virus detection (CVE-2010-0098). clamav has been updated to
version 0.96 which fixes those issues.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- systemtap
Remote attackers could execute arbitrary commands by including shell
meta characters in commands to the stap server (CVE-2009-4273).
Commands with a long arguments list could cause a buffer overflow
and crash the system if a script tried to retrieve the argument list
(CVE-2010-0411).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- apache2
When using a multithreaded MPM apache could leak memory of requests
handled by a different thread when processing subrequests
(CVE-2010-0434).
Specially crafted requests could crash mod\_proxy\_ajp (CVE-2010-0408).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- glib2
The when copying symbolic links the g\_file\_copy function set the
target of the link to mode 0777 therefore exposing potentially
sensitive information or allowing other user to modify files they
should not have access to (CVE-2009-3289).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- mediawiki
MediaWiki was prone to a CSS validation flaw and data leakage
vulnerability (CVE-2010-1189, CVE-2010-1190).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- apache
Specially crafted requests could lead to an integer overflow in
mod\_proxy. Attackers could exploit that to crash apache or
potentially cause execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2010-0010).
The problem only affects 64bit architectures.
Affected Products: SLES9

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
