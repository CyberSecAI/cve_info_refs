- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists when processing a specially crafted .wav file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when handling the input .wav file.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Local Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application when the malformed .wav file is loaded and played in the application.
- **Attack vectors:**  Local, by having the user load the crafted .wav file using the "Select File" button in the application, and then click Play.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted .wav file and get the victim to open it with the vulnerable application.
