Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4978

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from two weaknesses in the mybackup 1.4.0 application: an arbitrary file download vulnerability and a remote file inclusion vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Download:** The `down.php` script allows an attacker to download arbitrary files from the server due to insufficient input validation of the filename parameter.
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `index.php` script allows the inclusion of remote files by manipulating the `main_content` parameter. This could allow the execution of arbitrary code hosted on a malicious server.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, potentially exposing system configuration files, credentials, or other confidential information.
    *   **Remote File Inclusion:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to a complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Download:** The attack vector is the `down.php` script, where the `filename` parameter can be manipulated to traverse directories and access sensitive files.
    *   **Remote File Inclusion:** The attack vector is the `index.php` script, where the `main_content` parameter can be manipulated to include a malicious script from a remote server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Download:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable `down.php` script. No authentication is needed.
    *   **Remote File Inclusion:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable `index.php` script and needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit-db entry references a related CVE, CVE-2009-4977, suggesting a cluster of vulnerabilities in the same application.
*   The exploit-db entry provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) for both vulnerabilities, demonstrating how to exploit them.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by SirGod.
*   The vulnerable application is mybackup 1.4.0.
