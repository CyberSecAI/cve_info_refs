Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the weenCompany application. Specifically, the `articleid` parameter in the `index.php` script is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to:
  - Read sensitive data.
  - Modify or delete existing data.
  - Potentially gain further access to the server if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` by manipulating the `articleid` parameter.
   - Example exploit URI: `http://server/index.php?moduleid=m2_news[SQL-inj]&articleid=1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server where the weenCompany application is hosted.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of web requests and SQL syntax to craft the malicious SQL payload.
