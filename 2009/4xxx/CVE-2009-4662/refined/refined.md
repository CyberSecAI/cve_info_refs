Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4662 (Note: The provided content does not explicitly state this CVE ID, but the vulnerability details match CVE-2009-4662, which is a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Novell GroupWise WebAccess)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `User.Theme.index` parameter of Novell GroupWise WebAccess. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of proper input sanitization/validation on the `User.Theme.index` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary web scripts into the user's browser when they access a crafted link.
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - Redirect users to a malicious website.
    - Steal user session cookies.
    - Perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific URL containing a malicious script within the `User.Theme.index` parameter.
- An attacker could then trick a user into clicking this malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript code.
- The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to click the crafted URL. This could be achieved via social engineering or other methods.

**Affected versions:**
- GroupWise 7.0 up to (and including) 7.03 HP3
- GroupWise 8.0 up to (and including) 8.0.0 HP2

**Resolution:**
- For GroupWise 7.x systems, apply GroupWise 7.03 Hot Patch 4 (HP4) or later.
- For GroupWise 8.0 systems, apply GroupWise 8.0 Support Pack 1 (SP1) or later.
