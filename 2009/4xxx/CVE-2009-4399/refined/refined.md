The provided content is a security advisory for TYPO3, specifically addressing CVE-2009-4399.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The identified vulnerabilities are present in various third-party TYPO3 extensions. These vulnerabilities include SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: Allows attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, possibly leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.
- Information Disclosure: Allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL injection: Could lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to the database, and potential manipulation of application data.
- XSS: Can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, cookie theft, and defacement of websites, affecting users of the site.
- Information Disclosure: Results in sensitive data exposure to unauthorized individuals.

**Attack vectors:**
- SQL injection: Exploitation is achieved through the manipulation of input fields or parameters that are used in database queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- XSS: Exploitation occurs when user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed in web pages, allowing an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts.
- Information Disclosure: Occurs through vulnerabilities that expose sensitive information unintentionally.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to identify vulnerable input fields or parameters within the affected TYPO3 extensions to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- For XSS, an attacker must inject malicious scripts via vulnerable parts of the application, which are then executed by other users' browsers.
- For information disclosure, an attacker needs to be able to access the affected endpoints.
- Generally, knowledge of web application vulnerabilities and basic understanding of HTTP requests is required.
