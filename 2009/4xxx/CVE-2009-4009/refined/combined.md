How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The other allows a (skilled) attacker to spoof domain data > for domain names he does not own. >  > The first issue is at least a DoS, but in all likelihood can be expanded > into a full compromise ('rooted'). >  > The release that will be made public is already available for distributors. > Other good news is that it is already serving over a million ISP customers, > with no apparent problems. >  > Contact me off-list for quick access to the new PowerDNS Recursor code, > patch & release notes. >  > If you need any kind of assistance in doing a smooth upgrade, also do not > hesitate to contact me.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=552285#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2010-01-04 15:20:23 UTC  ``` Bert, is -4009 for the first issue (DoS / code execution) and -4010 for the second (domain data spoofing)?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=552285#c2)  Ruben Kerkhof    2010-01-04 15:28:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=552285#c1))  Tomas, is there a way to update the package before wednesday without the details showing up in public cvs?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=552285#c3)  bert hubert    2010-01-04 15:30:03 UTC  ``` This is correct. These issues are extremely urgent - how can I get the patch/new tarball to you?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=552285#c4)  Ruben Kerkhof    2010-01-04 15:46:36 UTC  ``` I've just received the tarball from Bert via private mail.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=552285#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2010-01-04 15:52:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=552285#c2)) > Tomas, is there a way to update the package before wednesday without the > details showing up in public cvs?    No.  Fedora CVS / build system is public, so once new version is committed / built, it will be available to anyone.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=552285#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2010-01-06 14:56:43 UTC  ``` Bert, can this bug be made public now?  I don't see any announcement in announce list archives, but upstream pages already offer updated binaries (but not sources).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=552285#c7)  bert hubert    2010-01-06 15:13:34 UTC  ``` Yes, you can go live Sources are available now too.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=552285#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2010-01-06 15:19:57 UTC  ``` Thanks, making bug public.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=552285#c9)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-07 00:53:55 UTC  ``` pdns-recursor-3.1.7.2-1.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.
