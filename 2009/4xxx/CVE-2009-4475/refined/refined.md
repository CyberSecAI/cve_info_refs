Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `com_joomlub` component of Joomla. Specifically, the `aid` parameter in the URL is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries through the `aid` parameter.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:**  The exploit also demonstrates a blind SQL injection vulnerability where an attacker can infer information by observing the application's response to true/false SQL conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential information. This is demonstrated by the example using `version()` to get the database version.
*   **Data Manipulation:** It may also be possible to modify or delete data.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the database permissions, and application structure, complete system compromise is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via crafted HTTP GET requests targeting the vulnerable Joomla component.
*   **Manipulated `aid` Parameter:**  The `aid` parameter in the URL is manipulated with SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote, requiring only network access to the vulnerable Joomla installation.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Basic knowledge on how to send HTTP requests with modified parameters is required.
*   **SQL Injection knowledge:** Familiarity with SQL injection techniques is necessary for successful exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit examples include both standard SQL injection (using `UNION ALL SELECT`) and blind SQL injection (using `AND 1=1` and substring comparisons).
*   The exploit shows that an attacker can obtain information about the database version.
*   The exploit uses a specific component path and parameter: `index.php?option=com_joomlub&controller=auction&view=auction&task=edit&aid=...`
*   The exploit was verified by Exploit-DB.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-4475 and how an attacker might exploit it.
