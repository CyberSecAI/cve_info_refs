The provided content is related to CVE-2009-4542 and describes multiple vulnerabilities in IsolSoft Support Center 2.5.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of the `lang` parameter in several PHP files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows inclusion of local files through the `lang` parameter.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows inclusion of remote files through the `lang` parameter.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code through the `lang` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **LFI:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure.
*   **RFI:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file.
*  **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or further malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The `lang` parameter in the following files:
* `index.php`
* `newticket.php`
* `rempass.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the `lang` parameter. No special access or prior knowledge is required. The vulnerabilities can be triggered remotely.
