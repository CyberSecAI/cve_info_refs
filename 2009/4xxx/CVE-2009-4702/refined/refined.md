The provided content is a security advisory for multiple vulnerabilities found in several third-party TYPO3 extensions, and therefore is related to CVE-2009-4702.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

The advisory lists multiple vulnerabilities across different extensions. These include:

*   **SQL Injection:** This is the most common vulnerability type, affecting extensions like CoolURI, Reset backend password, datamints Newsticker, [Gobernalia] Front End News Submitter, Myth download, Tour Extension and Webesse Image Gallery. It involves injecting malicious SQL code into database queries, potentially allowing attackers to access, modify, or delete data. Blind SQL Injection was also found in the Myth Download extension.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Affects extensions like [Gobernalia] Front End News Submitter, Mailform and Twitter Search. XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Affects Webesse E-Card. This vulnerability can lead to the exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Path Traversal:** Affects Webesse E-Card. Allows an attacker to access files and directories that are stored outside of the intended web root folder.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** SQL injection could lead to the exposure, modification, or deletion of sensitive data stored in the database, including user information, application settings, and content.
*   **Account Hijacking:** XSS could allow attackers to steal session cookies, potentially leading to account takeover.
*   **Website Defacement:** XSS can also be used to inject malicious content on web pages, defacing the site or redirecting users to malicious pages.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data.
*   **File System Access:** Path traversal can allow an attacker to gain access to parts of the file system that would otherwise be inaccessible.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vectors for these vulnerabilities vary:

*   **SQL Injection:** Typically involves manipulating input fields or URLs to inject malicious SQL commands into database queries performed by the vulnerable extension.
*   **XSS:** Attackers inject malicious scripts through input fields that are not properly sanitized.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Unspecified how this was possible through the extension, it is likely an issue with insufficient access controls.
*  **Path Traversal:** By providing specially crafted paths to the web server, an attacker can access files outside of the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web Skills:** Attackers need to understand how websites work and how to manipulate requests to exploit SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **No privileged access needed:** In most cases, no special privileges are needed to exploit these vulnerabilities, as they are often exploitable through publicly accessible website components.
*   **Targeted Extensions:** The attacker needs to target the specific vulnerable extensions on a TYPO3 instance, as the vulnerabilities reside in these third party extensions, not the TYPO3 core.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in insecure coding practices within the third-party extensions:

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Extensions fail to properly validate and sanitize user inputs, leading to SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:** Inadequate permissions checks or other measures led to information disclosure and path traversal vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory highlights that these are third-party extensions and not part of the TYPO3 core.
*   Some of the vulnerable extensions were removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository because the developers could not be contacted to create a patch. Users of these extensions are advised to uninstall them.
*   The advisory credits the security researchers and TYPO3 security team members who reported the issues.
*   Links to the fixed versions of the extensions are provided, where available.
*   Users are advised to follow the TYPO3 SECURITY Guide and subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list to receive future security bulletins.
