The provided content is related to CVE-2009-4395.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple third-party TYPO3 extensions contain vulnerabilities due to inadequate input sanitization and/or improper handling of data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: Malicious SQL queries can be injected to extract or manipulate data from the database.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code can be injected to be executed within a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions.
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive information may be exposed due to improper access controls.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL injection can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- XSS can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or malicious redirects, affecting users of the website.
- Information Disclosure can lead to leakage of sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
Attack vectors depend on the specific vulnerability:
- SQL injection: Attackers inject malicious SQL code via user inputs or other data that is processed by the affected extension.
- XSS: Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code through user inputs or other data, which is then rendered in the victim's browser.
- Information disclosure: An attacker may gain access to sensitive information due to misconfigured access controls or other flaws.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code through user inputs or other data the extension uses.
- For information disclosure, the attacker may require a position that would grant them access to the vulnerable information such as a user of the application or someone with access to the system.
