  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2009-4543",
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when including files, allowing an attacker to include local files through the 'lng' parameter in `index.php`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
        "Improper Input Validation"

       "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, including configuration files, application source code, or other confidential data.",
       "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file with the `lng` parameter containing a path to the target file using directory traversal techniques",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required."

      "cve": "CVE-2009-4543",

        "weaknesses": [
          "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
           "Improper Input Validation"

         "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote code on the server, which can potentially lead to a complete compromise of the system.",

        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. The attacker needs to host the malicious payload remotely. No authentication is required."

      "cve": "CVE-2009-4543",
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in `kbase.php` when rendering content, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",

         "Improper Input Validation"
      ],
        "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which can be executed in the victim's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.",
        "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by including malicious javascript in the URL path to `kbase.php`",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication is required. The victim needs to access the crafted URL for the XSS payload to be triggered."
