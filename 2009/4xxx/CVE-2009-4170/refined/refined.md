The provided content details vulnerabilities found in the WP-Cumulus WordPress plugin, which aligns with the likely nature of CVE-2009-4170, given the year.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The full path to the `wp-cumulus.php` file is exposed by accessing the plugin's directory.
    *   **Attack vector**: Accessing the plugin file directly through the web browser.
    *  **Weakness**:  Insecure file handling or lack of proper access control.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `tagcloud.swf` file is vulnerable to XSS by injecting malicious JavaScript code through the `tagcloud` parameter. This is described as a "Strictly social XSS" attack where the code executes when a user clicks the injected link.
    *   **Attack vector**: Injecting malicious JavaScript into the tagcloud parameter of tagcloud.swf.
    *   **Weakness**: Insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-provided input within the flash file.
*   **HTML Injection:** The `tagcloud.swf` file is vulnerable to HTML injection via the `tagcloud` parameter. This allows embedding arbitrary HTML, even if JavaScript URIs are blocked by the flash file or a WAF.
     *  **Attack vector**: Injecting malicious HTML into the tagcloud parameter of tagcloud.swf.
     * **Weakness**: Insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-provided input within the flash file

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Exposes the server's file system structure, which could be used by an attacker to gather more information for further attacks.
*   **XSS:**  Allows attackers to execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser. This could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **HTML Injection:** Enables attackers to inject arbitrary HTML into the page, potentially leading to phishing attacks, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Versions:**

*   WP-Cumulus versions 1.22 and earlier are vulnerable.
*   Version 1.23 fixes the XSS vulnerability but not the HTML injection vulnerability.

**Attacker Capabilities:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious payload and convince a user to open it in their browser.
