Raphael Geissert discovered that lintian did not correctly validate

certain filenames when processing input. If a user or an automated system

were tricked into running lintian on a specially crafted set of files,

a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

Package        : lintian
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-4013 CVE-2009-4014 CVE-2009-4015

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in lintian,
a Debian package checker. The following Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project ids have been assigned to identify them:

CVE-2009-4013: missing control files sanitation

    Control field names and values were not sanitised before using them
    in certain operations that could lead to directory traversals.

    Patch systems' control files were not sanitised before using them
    in certain operations that could lead to directory traversals.

    An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to overwrite
    arbitrary files or disclose system information.

CVE-2009-4014: format string vulnerabilities

    Multiple check scripts and the Lintian::Schedule module were using
    user-provided input as part of the sprintf/printf format string.

CVE-2009-4015: arbitrary command execution

    File names were not properly escaped when passing them as arguments
    to certain commands, allowing the execution of other commands as
    pipes or as a set of shell commands.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.23.28+etch1.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.24.2.1+lenny1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.2

We recommend that you upgrade your lintian packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
