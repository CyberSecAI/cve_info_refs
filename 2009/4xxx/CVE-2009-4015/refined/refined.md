Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2009-4015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is improper handling of filenames by `lintian` when processing input. Specifically, filenames were not properly escaped when passed as arguments to certain commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  The lack of proper escaping allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands via crafted filenames. This could happen when `lintian` processes these filenames by passing them as arguments to system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `lintian`. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves tricking a user or automated system into running `lintian` on a specially crafted set of files that have malicious filenames.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the application passes user-controlled filenames to shell commands without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to create specially crafted files with malicious filenames.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user or automated system into running `lintian` on these crafted files.
* The attacker does not require direct access to the system, but must have the ability to influence or provide input to the system that is being inspected by `lintian`

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in `lintian`, a Debian package checker.
*   The fix involves ensuring that filenames are properly escaped before being passed to commands.
*   The vulnerability was identified by Raphael Geissert.
*   The vulnerability is also mentioned in Debian Security Advisory DSA-1979-1, which addresses multiple issues in `lintian`.

**Affected Versions and Fixes:**
*   Ubuntu 6.06, 8.04, 8.10, 9.04, and 9.10 are affected, requiring updates to specific package versions.
*   Debian oldstable (etch) required version 1.23.28+etch1
*   Debian stable (lenny) required version 1.24.2.1+lenny1
*   Debian unstable (sid) required version 2.3.2

The provided information gives a clear picture of the arbitrary command execution vulnerability in `lintian`, how it can be exploited, and what the impact of the vulnerability would be.
