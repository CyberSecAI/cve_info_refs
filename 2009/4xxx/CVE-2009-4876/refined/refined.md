Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4876

**Vulnerable Software:** Netrix CMS 1.0

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is an authentication bypass issue due to an unspecified flaw in the `cikkform.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain access to the administrative panel.
*   **Remote SQL Injection (Implied):** While not directly stated in the provided exploit, the "Remote SQL Injection Vulnerability" mentioned in the exploit description strongly suggests that this vulnerability is likely exploitable through SQL Injection, allowing further unauthorized access or data modification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Complete System Control:** An attacker could gain full control of the CMS.
*   **Content Manipulation:** Attackers can edit or modify any content on the website.
*   **Malicious Code Injection:** It's explicitly stated that the attacker can "put on your index" meaning they can inject arbitrary code or content onto the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is initiated by sending an HTTP GET request to `cikkform.php` with a specific `cid` parameter, i.e. `http://www.site.com/path/admin/cikkform.php?cid=1`. This bypasses the authentication and allows access to the administrative panel.
*  **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, and does not require local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable Netrix CMS.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests with specific query parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit details include a demo link, which may no longer be active.
*   The exploit also indicates the possibility of SQL injection, which could be a secondary vulnerability or a consequence of the authentication bypass.
*   The exploit is relatively simple, indicating a lack of proper input validation or access control in the `cikkform.php` file.
