The provided content is related to CVE-2009-4792.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `members.php` script of BandSite CMS 1.1.4. Specifically, the `memid` parameter from the `$_REQUEST` array is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`memid`), making it susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive data from the database. As demonstrated in the Proof of Concept (PoC), this includes:
  -  Administrator credentials (username, password, email)
  -  Database credentials (username, password, database name, host).
- In addition to SQL injection, the content mentions a separate vulnerability: arbitrary file upload. This allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code (e.g. PHP shell) if logged in as an administrator.

**Attack vectors:**
- SQL Injection: Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `members.php` with a malicious `memid` parameter.
- Upload Shell: Successfully authenticating as an administrator and using the `addphotos` functionality to upload and execute a PHP shell.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- SQL Injection: Requires no authentication. The attacker can directly send a crafted URL to exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability.
- Upload Shell: Requires the attacker to be logged in as an administrator.
