Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a session fixation issue in Request Tracker (RT) versions 3.0.0 to 3.8.5.
*   The core issue stems from how RT handles session identifiers before user authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The primary vulnerability is that RT does not properly regenerate session IDs after a user logs in. This allows an attacker to set a session ID, trick a user into using it, and then hijack that user's session after login.
*  **Secondary related vulnerability:** An attacker with HTTP access to the RT server could construct a similar attack without the need for a server within the same domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to take over a legitimate user's session.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Once a session is hijacked, the attacker gains the same level of access as the compromised user, potentially including access to sensitive data and the ability to modify the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Same-Domain Server Attack:** An attacker operating a server within the same domain as the RT instance can set a specific session identifier and trick the target user into using it.
*   **HTTP Access Attack:** An attacker with HTTP access to the RT server can craft an attack without needing a server in the same domain. This is related to the main vulnerability and was discovered during internal audit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Same-Domain Server:** For the primary attack vector, the attacker needs the ability to operate a server in the same domain where the RT instance is hosted.
*  **HTTP Access:** For the secondary attack vector, the attacker needs HTTP access to the RT server.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the attacker's controlled resource (e.g., a malicious link) with the manipulated session identifier.
*  The attacker needs to perform their actions *before* the victim logs into RT.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in RT version 3.8.6 and later and with patches for older versions.
*   Using external authentication sources (such as Apache) via RT's `$WebExternalAuth` setting mitigates the vulnerability, but users should still apply the patch. However, the `RT-Authen-ExternalAuth` extension does not protect from the vulnerability.
* The provided content indicates that CVE-2009-3585 was assigned to this issue.
