- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the web servers' logging mechanisms not sanitizing escape sequences present in HTTP requests. When these logs are displayed in a terminal, the escape sequences are interpreted, potentially leading to unwanted actions.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization of escape sequences in HTTP requests before writing them to log files. This allows an attacker to inject terminal control characters into the logs.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject terminal escape sequences that, when the log file is viewed in a terminal emulator (using tools like cat or tail), can execute arbitrary commands or write data to files on the viewing user's system. This allows an attacker to potentially gain control of the system where the log file is being viewed. The impact is tied to the user privileges of the account viewing the logs.
- **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through sending crafted HTTP requests containing terminal escape sequences. The web server logs these requests, and the terminal control characters are then activated when the log file is viewed in a terminal emulator.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. This typically requires network access to the web server. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated but needs to inject specific escape sequences in the request to exploit the vulnerability.
