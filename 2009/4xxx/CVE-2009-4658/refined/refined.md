- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Xerver HTTP Server crashes when the HTTP server port is set to a non-numeric value through the web-based configuration program.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of input validation on the HTTP server port configuration field. The web-based admin panel does not require authentication to change server configuration.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote denial of service (DoS). The server crashes and cannot be restarted without manual modification of the configuration file.
- **Attack vectors**:
    1. Access the web-based configuration program on port 32123.
    2. Navigate to the port configuration setting.
    3. Input a non-numeric value (e.g., "Dr_IDE") into the port field.
    4. Submit the configuration change.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the server running Xerver and its web-based configuration interface (port 32123), and does not require authentication to access the admin panel.
