This update hints there are security fixes, but I can't tell what they are.
Does someone have more information? If not I'll let MITRE assign a generic
"something is broken" sort of ID.

Thanks.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MyBB 1.4.11 Released – Minor Patch & Security Update

Posted on [December 29, 2009](https://blog.mybb.com/2009/12/29/mybb-1-4-11-released-minor-patch-security-update/ "11:38 am")  by  [Chris Boulton](https://blog.mybb.com/author/surfichris/ "View all posts by Chris Boulton")

MyBB 1.4.11 is now available on the MyBB website and is a minor patch update to 1.4.10.

This release is to ensure that all users on 1.4.10 have the latest patches, to fix a small and rare bug that with malicious intent can be used to assist a Denial-of-Service attack, and to patch a low security issue that can allow a user to check for file existence outside of the web root.

Thank you to Labrocca and Secunia (through a third party) for alerting us of these issues.

#### **What’s fixed in this version?**

* [Issue #617](http://dev.mybboard.net/issues/617)
* [Issue #603](http://dev.mybboard.net/issues/603)
* [Issue #600](http://dev.mybboard.net/issues/600)
* [Issue #584](http://dev.mybboard.net/issues/584)
* [Issue #580](http://dev.mybboard.net/issues/580)
* [Issue #581](http://dev.mybboard.net/issues/581)
* [Issue #567](http://dev.mybboard.net/issues/567)
* [Issue #563](http://dev.mybboard.net/issues/563)
* [Issue #536](http://dev.mybboard.net/issues/536)

This release has been tested by our Software Quality Assurance group.

**This update does not require running the upgrader.**

*There are **no** database schema, language string, or template changes in this version.*

#### **MyBB 1.4.10 to MyBB 1.4.11 Patch**

This patch is only for users running MyBB 1.4.10. If you are running an older version of MyBB then please download MyBB 1.4.11 from the MyBB site and update to it using the general [[Wiki: Upgrading]](http://wiki.mybboard.net/index.php/Upgrading "View the MyBB Wiki page for Upgrading") guide.

Please download the attached ZIP archive and replace the files in your forum directory with those from the ZIP archive.

[changed\_files\_1411.zip](http://mybboard.net/download/114)

If you wish to manually patch your board please download “mybb\_1410\_patches.txt” and follow the instructions in that file.

[mybb\_1410\_patches.txt](http://mybboard.net/download/115)

**The manual patch set instructions only fixes the security vulnerabilities and is only made available to temporarily secure your forum until you have time to run the complete upgrade.**

#### The following files were changed since the initial MyBB 1.4.10 release:

* admin
  + modules
    - style
      * templates.php
    - tools
      * backupdb.php
    - user
      * users.php
* inc
  + datahandlers
    - event.php
    - user.php
  + class\_core.php
  + class\_error.php
  + class\_moderation.php
  + functions\_upload.php
  + functions\_time.php
  + tasks
    - backupdb.php
* calendar.php
* usercp.php

\* Red represents files that contain security updates

\* Green represents new files added in this release

#### **Reporting MyBB security vulnerabilities**

If you think you’ve found a vulnerability in MyBB, we advise you not to publicly post it on these forums or publicly release information about it elsewhere until we’ve had time to prepare and release a patch.

As always, you can send through security related messages on the MyBB website from the [Contact Us](http://www.mybboard.net/contact/) page.

#### **MyBB 1.2.14 Patch**

Please follow step #1 in the mybb\_1410\_patches.txt file as listed above.

Please note all users of the 1.2.x series are urged to upgrade to the latest release of MyBB. (1.4.11) MyBB 1.2 is no longer being supported and security updates for the MyBB 1.2 series will only last through December 2009.

Thank you,

MyBB Team

      You must have neglected to update your forum for quite a long time Harry since there have been no vulnerabilities that could allow a hacker to drop your database for quite a while now.

    Great! Finally an update here – have been waiting for it. Our managers at essay writing service have even been thinking about switching to a different service provider because of the bug. So, great that you fixed it and launched an update!
