Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw in the TYPO3 CMS application. Specifically, the `showUid` parameter within a URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation on the `showUid` parameter, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database. This can lead to:
    - Data leakage of sensitive information, including usernames and passwords from the `be_users` table.
    - Potential modification or deletion of data within the database.
    - Possibly gaining administrative access, if the attacker is able to obtain administrator credentials.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `index.php` file. The vulnerable parameter is `showUid`, which the attacker can manipulate with SQL injection payload.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target TYPO3 instance. No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit is demonstrated through the following URL structure:

```
http://www.host.com/index.php?id=[xxx][showUid]=[SQL-injection]&cHash=[xxx]
```

Where `[SQL-injection]` is replaced with a SQL injection payload, such as:

```
-1+union+select+username,2,password,4,5,6,7+from+be_users--
```

This specific payload attempts to extract the usernames and passwords from the `be_users` table, which holds TYPO3 backend user credentials.

**Additional Information**

* The content explicitly mentions the vulnerable application as TYPO3 CMS 4.0.
* It also provides the admin panel location as `/typo3/index.php` which could be useful for attackers after successful exploitation.
* The exploit was initially disclosed on milw0rm.com.
