The provided content is related to CVE-2009-4705. It is a security advisory (TYPO3-SA-2009-010) detailing multiple vulnerabilities found in several third-party TYPO3 extensions.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

The vulnerabilities stem from insecure coding practices within the listed third-party extensions. These include:
*   **SQL Injection:** Improper handling of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Insufficient sanitization of user-provided data before displaying it on a web page, enabling attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Path Traversal:**  Vulnerability that allows an attacker to access files and directories that are located outside the web server's root directory.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Vulnerability that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The following extensions were identified as having vulnerabilities:
*   **CoolURI (cooluri):** SQL Injection
*   **Reset backend password (cwt_resetbepassword):** SQL Injection
*  **datamints Newsticker (datamints_newsticker):** SQL Injection
*   **[Gobernalia] Front End News Submitter (gb_fenewssubmit):** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection
*   **Mailform (mailform):** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Myth download (myth_download):** Blind SQL Injection
*   **Tour Extension (pm_tour):** SQL Injection
*   **Twitter Search (twittersearch):** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Webesse E-Card (ws_ecard):** Information Disclosure, Path Traversal
*   **Webesse Image Gallery (ws_gallery):** SQL Injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities varies:
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers could inject malicious scripts, leading to actions such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the website.
*   **Path Traversal:**  Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive server files.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** By injecting malicious SQL code into vulnerable input fields or parameters within the extensions.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious scripts into input fields that are displayed to other users.
*   **Path Traversal:** By manipulating file paths in the URL.
*   **Information Disclosure:** By using the path traversal vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable extensions. This could be through user-facing forms, URL parameters, or other input mechanisms exposed by the extensions.
*   For SQL injection, the attacker needs to be able to craft valid SQL queries within the context of the vulnerable application.
*   For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts.
*   For path traversal, the attacker needs to manipulate file paths in the URL.

The advisory provides specific version numbers affected and, where available, links to updated versions of the extensions. It also notes that some vulnerable extensions have been removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository because the maintainers could not be contacted. Users are advised to uninstall those extensions.
