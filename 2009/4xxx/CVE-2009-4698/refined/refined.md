Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-4698:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the XOOPS Celepar Module Qas. Specifically, the `cod_categoria` parameter in `categoria.php`, and the `codigo` parameter in `imprimir.php` and `aviso.php` are not being sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:**  The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to unsanitized input. This allows an attacker to inject SQL code through the vulnerable parameters.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is also vulnerable to XSS through multiple parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, modify data, or even take full control of the database server.
*   **XSS:**  An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or phishing attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the affected PHP files within the module.

    *   Blind SQL Injection is possible through `categoria.php?cod_categoria=[SQLi]`, `imprimir.php?codigo=[SQLi]`, and `aviso.php?codigo=[SQLi]`
    *   XSS is possible through `categoria.php?cod_categoria=[XSS]`, `index.php?opcao=[XSS]`, `categoria.php/[XSS]`, and `index.php/[XSS]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   No authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit for the SQL injection vulnerability involves injecting SQL code into the `cod_categoria` or `codigo` parameters of the listed PHP files. This can be achieved by using SQL syntax like `AND 1=1` to test for boolean results, or `UNION SELECT` to extract data.
*   The XSS vulnerabilities can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the respective parameters. Example payloads provided are:
    *   `"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>`
    *   `1>'><ScRiPt %0A%0D>alert(439286918587)%3B</ScRiPt>`
    *   `/>'><ScRiPt>alert(665068655391)</ScRiPt>`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db content provides specific vulnerable URLs and example payloads to demonstrate the vulnerabilities.
*   The `aviso.php` file is highlighted as being vulnerable to SQL injection with an example using `UNION SELECT`.
