| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=722393#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-07-15 07:38:20 UTC  ``` A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Auerswald PBX/System Telephone usb driver implementation. There's no upstream patch as the affected driver was removed from the kernel in 2.6.27.  For more information, check out the references: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4067> <http://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/files/Advisories/mwri_linux-usb-buffer-overflow_2009-10-29.pdf>  Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank Rafael Dominguez Vega for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=722393#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-07-17 15:51:27 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as the affected code has been removed. It was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1386.html>. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=722393#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-20 17:29:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:1386 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1386.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=722393#c9)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-10-25 03:48:15 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 748675](show_bug.cgi?id=748675 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2009-4067 kernel: usb: buffer overflow in auerswald_probe() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=722393#c10)  Tom    2011-11-07 22:32:19 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=722393#c8)) > This issue has been addressed in following products: >  >   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 >  > Via RHSA-2011:1386 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1386.html>  Can you please attach the content of the patch here or point to me the commit which contains this fix?  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=722393#c11)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-11-08 09:21:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=722393#c10)) > (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=722393#c8)) > > This issue has been addressed in following products: > >  > >   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 > >  > > Via RHSA-2011:1386 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1386.html> >  > Can you please attach the content of the patch here or point to me the commit > which contains this fix? >  > Thanks.  This was not fixed upstream as it was removed in 2.6.27. This issue is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 specific.
