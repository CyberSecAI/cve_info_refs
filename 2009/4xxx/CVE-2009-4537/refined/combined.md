How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes security issues and several
bugs is now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
(RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the IPv6 Extension Header (EH) handling
implementation in the Linux kernel. The skb->dst data structure was not
properly validated in the ipv6\_hop\_jumbo() function. This could possibly
lead to a remote denial of service. (CVE-2007-4567)

The Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team reported two flaws in the routing
implementation. If an attacker was able to cause a large enough number of
collisions in the routing hash table (via specially-crafted packets) for
the emergency route flush to trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if
the kernel routing cache was disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be
left behind after a route lookup, leading to a kernel panic.
(CVE-2009-4272)

A flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in
the Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using packets larger
than the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in
partial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws
could also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.
(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538)

A flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel.
Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network cards
supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of
service. (CVE-2009-4537)

The x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current
Privilege Level (CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL). A user in a guest
could leverage these flaws to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or
possibly escalate their privileges within that guest. (CVE-2010-0298,
CVE-2010-0306)

A flaw was found in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation. Access
to the internal data structure pit\_state, which represents the data state
of the emulated PIT, was not properly validated in the pit\_ioport\_read()
function. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2010-0309)

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2006-6304, CVE-2009-2910,
CVE-2009-3080, CVE-2009-3556, CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, CVE-2009-4020,
CVE-2009-4021, CVE-2009-4138, and CVE-2009-4141; ntp issue CVE-2009-3563;
dbus issue CVE-2009-1189; dnsmasq issues CVE-2009-2957 and CVE-2009-2958;
gnutls issue CVE-2009-2730; krb5 issue CVE-2009-4212; bind issue
CVE-2010-0097; gzip issue CVE-2010-0001; openssl issues CVE-2009-2409 and
CVE-2009-4355; and gcc issue CVE-2009-3736.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* on systems with a large number of disk devices, USB storage devices may

get enumerated after "/dev/sdz", for example, "/dev/sdcd". This was not
handled by the udev rules, resulting in a missing "/dev/live" symbolic
link, causing installations from USB media to fail. With this update, udev
rules correctly handle USB storage devices on systems with a large number
of disk devices, which resolves this issue. (BZ#555083)

As RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from the KVM update
RHSA-2010:0088 have been included in this update:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0088.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=550907#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-12-28 03:30:42 UTC  ``` Description of problem: This was disclosed at 26c3.  Fabian also mentioned the fix for [CVE-2009-1389](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1389) regarding the r8169 driver introduces a similar security problem as this: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/fdd7b4c3302c93f6833e338903ea77245eb510b4>  - RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, 16383); + RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, rx_buf_sz);  is actually a revert of this: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/126fa4b9ca5d9d7cb7d46f779ad3bd3631ca387c>  - /* For gigabit rtl8169, MTU + header + CRC + VLAN */ - RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, tp->rx_buf_sz); + /* Low hurts. Let's disable the filtering. */ + RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, 16383);  The accompanying comment for the original commit (126fa):  The size of the incoming frame is not correctly checked.  The RxMaxSize register (0xDA) does not work as expected and incoming frames whose size exceeds the MTU actually end spanning multiple descriptors. The first Rx descriptor contains the size of the whole frame (or some garbage in its place). The driver does not expect something above the space allocated to the current skb and crashes loudly when it issues a skb_put.  The fix contains two parts: - disable hardware Rx size filtering: so far it only proved to be able to trigger some new fancy errors; [...]  warned of issues when using hardware Rx size filtering and Fabian claimed to be able to trigger something similar to the e1000 bug when using a specific packet size.

Hey all-
	A while back Eric submitted a patch for r8169 in which the proper
allocated frame size was written to RXMaxSize to prevent the NIC from dmaing too
much data.  This was done in commit fdd7b4c3302c93f6833e338903ea77245eb510b4.  A
long time prior to that however, Francois posted
126fa4b9ca5d9d7cb7d46f779ad3bd3631ca387c, which expiclitly disabled the MaxSize
setting due to the fact that the hardware behaved in odd ways when overlong
frames were received on NIC's supported by this driver.  This was mentioned in a
security conference recently:
<http://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan//events/3596.en.html>

It seems that if we can't enable frame size filtering, then, as Eric correctly
noticed, we can find ourselves DMA-ing too much data to a buffer, causing
corruption.  As a result is seems that we are forced to allocate a frame which
is ready to handle a maximally sized receive.

I've not tested the below patch at all, and clearly it stinks to have to do.
But I thought it would be worth posting to solicit comments on it.

Thanks & Regards
Neil

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=550907#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-12-28 03:30:42 UTC  ``` Description of problem: This was disclosed at 26c3.  Fabian also mentioned the fix for [CVE-2009-1389](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1389) regarding the r8169 driver introduces a similar security problem as this: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/fdd7b4c3302c93f6833e338903ea77245eb510b4>  - RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, 16383); + RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, rx_buf_sz);  is actually a revert of this: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/126fa4b9ca5d9d7cb7d46f779ad3bd3631ca387c>  - /* For gigabit rtl8169, MTU + header + CRC + VLAN */ - RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, tp->rx_buf_sz); + /* Low hurts. Let's disable the filtering. */ + RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, 16383);  The accompanying comment for the original commit (126fa):  The size of the incoming frame is not correctly checked.  The RxMaxSize register (0xDA) does not work as expected and incoming frames whose size exceeds the MTU actually end spanning multiple descriptors. The first Rx descriptor contains the size of the whole frame (or some garbage in its place). The driver does not expect something above the space allocated to the current skb and crashes loudly when it issues a skb_put.  The fix contains two parts: - disable hardware Rx size filtering: so far it only proved to be able to trigger some new fancy errors; [...]  warned of issues when using hardware Rx size filtering and Fabian claimed to be able to trigger something similar to the e1000 bug when using a specific packet size.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 GA Kernel was updated to 2.6.27.48 fixing
various bugs and security issues.
CVE-2010-1641: The do\_gfs2\_set\_flags function in fs/gfs2/file.c in the
Linux kernel does not verify the ownership of a file, which allows
local users to bypass intended access restrictions via a SETFLAGS
ioctl request.
CVE-2010-1087: The nfs\_wait\_on\_request function in fs/nfs/pagelist.c in
the Linux kernel allows attackers to cause a denial of service (Oops)
via unknown vectors related to truncating a file and an operation
that is not interruptible.
CVE-2010-1643: mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel, when strict overcommit
is enabled, does not properly handle the export of shmemfs objects
by knfsd, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
pointer dereference and knfsd crash) or possibly have unspecified
other impact via unknown vectors.
CVE-2010-1437: Race condition in the find\_keyring\_by\_name function
in security/keys/keyring.c in the Linux kernel allows local users
to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash)
or possibly have unspecified other impact via keyctl session commands
that trigger access to a dead keyring that is undergoing deletion by
the key\_cleanup function.
CVE-2010-1446: arch/1/mm/fsl\_booke\_mmu.c in KGDB in the Linux kernel,
when running on PowerPC, does not properly perform a security check
for access to a kernel page, which allows local users to overwrite
arbitrary kernel memory, related to Fsl booke.
CVE-2010-1162: The release\_one\_tty function in drivers/char/tty\_io.c in
the Linux kernel omits certain required calls to the put\_pid function,
which has unspecified impact and local attack vectors.
CVE-2009-4537: drivers/net/r8169.c in the r8169 driver in the Linux
kernel does not properly check the size of an Ethernet frame that
exceeds the MTU, which allows remote attackers to (1) cause a denial
of service (temporary network outage) via a packet with a crafted size,
in conjunction with certain packets containing A characters and certain
packets containing E characters; or (2) cause a denial of service
(system crash) via a packet with a crafted size, in conjunction with
certain packets containing '0' characters, related to the value of the
status register and erroneous behavior associated with the RxMaxSize
register. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect
fix for CVE-2009-1389. Code execution might be possible.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please reboot the machine after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=550907#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2009-12-28 03:30:42 UTC  ``` Description of problem: This was disclosed at 26c3.  Fabian also mentioned the fix for [CVE-2009-1389](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1389) regarding the r8169 driver introduces a similar security problem as this: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/fdd7b4c3302c93f6833e338903ea77245eb510b4>  - RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, 16383); + RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, rx_buf_sz);  is actually a revert of this: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/126fa4b9ca5d9d7cb7d46f779ad3bd3631ca387c>  - /* For gigabit rtl8169, MTU + header + CRC + VLAN */ - RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, tp->rx_buf_sz); + /* Low hurts. Let's disable the filtering. */ + RTL_W16(RxMaxSize, 16383);  The accompanying comment for the original commit (126fa):  The size of the incoming frame is not correctly checked.  The RxMaxSize register (0xDA) does not work as expected and incoming frames whose size exceeds the MTU actually end spanning multiple descriptors. The first Rx descriptor contains the size of the whole frame (or some garbage in its place). The driver does not expect something above the space allocated to the current skb and crashes loudly when it issues a skb_put.  The fix contains two parts: - disable hardware Rx size filtering: so far it only proved to be able to trigger some new fancy errors; [...]  warned of issues when using hardware Rx size filtering and Fabian claimed to be able to trigger something similar to the e1000 bug when using a specific packet size.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <4B386275.6020803@redhat.com>
Date: Mon, 28 Dec 2009 15:47:01 +0800
From: Eugene Teo <eugene@...hat.com>

Subject: CVE requests - kernel security regressions for CVE-2009-1385/and
 -1389

<http://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan//events/3596.en.html>

In Fabian's talk, he describes two kernel NIC driver issues:

Issue #1
Fabian claimed that CVE-2009-1385 has an incorrect fix:
<http://git.kernel.org/linus/ea30e11970a96cfe5e32c03a29332554573b4a10>.

Which fixes a DoS when the frame spans multiple buffers and the last
buffer contains less than four bytes. However, if that last fragment is
longer than 4 bytes, it will actually be taken into account while the
previous fragments will have been ignored.

Issue #2
The fix for CVE-2009-1389 regarding the r8169 driver introduces a
similar security problem as this:
<http://git.kernel.org/linus/fdd7b4c3302c93f6833e338903ea77245eb510b4> is
a revert of this:
<http://git.kernel.org/linus/126fa4b9ca5d9d7cb7d46f779ad3bd3631ca387c>.

The accompanying comment for the original commit (126fa):

The size of the incoming frame is not correctly checked.

The RxMaxSize register (0xDA) does not work as expected and incoming
frames whose size exceeds the MTU actually end spanning multiple
descriptors. The first Rx descriptor contains the size of the whole
frame (or some garbage in its place). The driver does not expect
something above the space allocated to the current skb and crashes
loudly when it issues a skb_put.

The fix contains two parts:
- disable hardware Rx size filtering: so far it only proved to be able
to trigger some new fancy errors;
[...]

There are other issues he mentioned during his talk, regarding squid and
pidgin. You can read about it at this wonderful blog:
<http://blog.c22.cc/2009/12/27/26c3-cat-procsysnetipv4fuckups/>.

Thanks, Eugene

Issue #3
I noticed that the e1000e driver also needs a similar fix as issue #1.

Progress on the patches can be found in either of the two bugs.

## 26C3: cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/fuckups

[1 Comment](https://c22blog.wordpress.com/2009/12/27/26c3-cat-procsysnetipv4fuckups/#respond)
Posted by [ChrisJohnRiley](https://c22blog.wordpress.com/author/catchtwotwo/ "Posts by ChrisJohnRiley") on December 27, 2009

[![](https://i0.wp.com/events.ccc.de/congress/2009/Fahrplan/images/event-3596-128x128.png)](http://events.ccc.de)“Built around a fictional average company network, we will tell the story of an attack making use of subtle bugs across the layers all of which are as of yet undisclosed. This will include a bug in an Ethernet-driver, which allows an attacker to bypass MAC- and IP-based filters, bugs in TCP-implementations that are assumed to be fixed but aren’t, a web-cache which confuses itself and an instant-messenger, which was fooled by the protocol specification.

All of these bugs share a common property: They are a consequence of insecure coding-practices.”

Alone these bugs don’t achieve much, but when chaining them together and creating a jigsaw puzzle of attacks, it’s possible to construct an effective attack.

**Stage 1:** Attacking the clients

The client offers a huge variety of attack possibilities. However you need to target the attack to the specific system. What application do you want to exploit, how, what host system, what shellcode to use…. The first phase is information disclosure.

The application of choice for this demo is Pidgin emoticons. Using the MSN-SLP protocol, a client receiving an emoticon is able to request the graphic from the client by specifying the file to download. By replacing the name of the emoticon to fetch with a more interesting file (/etc/passwd springs to mind), an attacker can remotely retrieve the file. Adium suffers from the same issues as Pidgin as the issue replies on the underlying protocol and not the application itself.

This issue is less of an implementation issue, and more of a protocol issue due to the complexity of the protocol (for no reason).

**Stage 2:** Bypassing the internal packet filter

When trying to attack layer *n*, it’s always best to look at the lower layers to see if you can control or exploit them. Looking at  the link layer protocol for example, you see the typical MTU value of 1500 Bytes. Now that gigabit ethernet is coming to the enterprise, jumbo frames are supported (alongside the older 1500 MTU values). So what happens if somebody sends 2000 Bytes to a system that only supports 1500 ? Typically a controller will take the data and make it spam more than one receive buffer. However in some instances this might be the case. For example the e1000 Linux driver from earlier this year. It was fixed, but not really fixed !

When sending a frame that would normally be checked (i.e. a firewall) only the first part is checked, the second isn’t. This means that you can bypass the firewall rules, and send packets (and attacks) to systems behind it. 0-day !!!

**Stage3:** Poisoning the cache

Squid webcache, is also a DNS cache. This means that it’s vulnerable to the typical issues that standard DNS suffers from. Squid implements it’s DNS features independently of other DNS servers. Even though it randomizes the source port, the port is then statically assigned for the lifetime of the cache. Many layers of security are handed off to other systems (i.e. layer II protections).

By using NAT’s build in source-port protections it’s possible to fingerprint the port used by Squid.

When waiting for a DNS response, Squid constantly queries the next received packet. When it’s not expecting a response it caches responses until it makes a request. You can then put responses into the cache before even asking Squid to resolve. The first response wins, and you’ve given answers before the DNS server has even asked the question.

Squid is automatically setup to wait 2 minutes for a response. By performing a DoS on the firewall, you have enough time to poison the cache.

 **Stage 4:** Denial of Service the Firewall

In 2009, a fix was implemented to the RTL Linux driver to re-enable the previously disabled hardware filtering on the NIC. By scanning possible MTU lengths, you can find the exact value that triggers the NIC to throw an error saying that multiple fragmented packets have been received, both of 8000 Bytes (this isn’t really possible). This will also cause garbage to be sent up the stack, instead of the packet contents. Lucky for us, the attacker can specify this garbage and control where the crash takes place.

More than just a Denial of Service, control over the remote machine.

**Conclusion**

* The security of a network component relies on the environment
* Security issues do not live in isolation – You never know the impact of a vulnerability until you see how it can be put to work

Debian Bug(s)  : 573071

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-4537

    Fabian Yamaguchi reported a missing check for Ethernet frames larger
    than the MTU in the r8169 driver. This may allow users on the local
    network to crash a system, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-0727

    Sachin Prabhu reported an issue in the GFS2 filesystem. Local users
    can trigger a BUG() altering the permissions on a locked file,
    resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1083

    Linus Torvalds reported an issue in the USB subsystem, which may allow
    local users to obtain portions of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-1084

    Neil Brown reported an issue in the Bluetooth subsystem that may
    permit remote attackers to overwrite memory through the creation
    of large numbers of sockets, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1086

    Ang Way Chuang reported an issue in the DVB subsystem for Digital
    TV adapters. By creating a specially-encoded MPEG2-TS frame, a remote
    attacker could cause the receiver to enter an endless loop, resulting
    in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1087

    Trond Myklebust reported an issue in the NFS filesystem. A local
    user may cause an oops by sending a fatal signal during a file
    truncation operation, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1088

    Al Viro reported an issue where automount symlinks may not
    be followed when LOOKUP_FOLLOW is not set. This has an unknown
    security impact.

CVE-2010-1162

    Catalin Marinas reported an issue in the tty subsystem that allows
    local attackers to cause a kernel memory leak, possibly resulting
    in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-1173

    Chris Guo from Nokia China and Jukka Taimisto and Olli Jarva from
    Codenomicon Ltd reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that allows
    a remote attacker to cause a denial of service using a malformed init
    package.

CVE-2010-1187

    Neil Hormon reported an issue in the TIPC subsystem. Local users can
    cause a denial of service by way of a NULL pointer dereference by
    sending datagrams through AF_TIPC before entering network mode.

CVE-2010-1437

    Toshiyuki Okajima reported a race condition in the keyring subsystem.
    Local users can cause memory corruption via keyctl commands that
    access a keyring in the process of being deleted, resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2010-1446

    Wufei reported an issue with kgdb on the PowerPC architecture,
    allowing local users to write to kernel memory. Note: this issue
    does not affect binary kernels provided by Debian. The fix is
    provided for the benefit of users who build their own kernels
    from Debian source.

CVE-2010-1451

    Brad Spengler reported an issue on the SPARC architecture that allows
    local users to execute non-executable pages.

This update also includes fixes a regression introduced by a previous
update. See the referenced Debian bug page for details.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.26-22lenny1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux
packages.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were
rebuilt for compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 5.0 (lenny)

# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/fuckups

![](../images/event-3596-128x128.png)

We will be presenting a number of previously undisclosed network-related design errors, ranging from data-link-layer bugs in Ethernet-drivers across issues in TCP/IP stacks all the way up to communication infrastructure components on layer 5.
Our focus is on subtle mistakes, which do not fall into the memory-corruption category and yet in combination provide an attacker with a powerful bag of tricks.

Built around a fictional average company network, we will tell the story of an attack making use of subtle bugs across the layers all of which are as of yet undisclosed. This will include a bug in an Ethernet-driver, which allows an attacker to bypass MAC- and IP-based filters, bugs in TCP-implementations that are assumed to be fixed but aren't, a web-cache which confuses itself and an instant-messenger, which was fooled by the protocol specification.

All of these bugs share a common property: They are a consequence of insecure design and not of insecure coding-practices.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
