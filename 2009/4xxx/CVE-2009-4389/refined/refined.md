    *    `vshoutbox` (vShoutbox extension)
    *   `fe_rtenews` (Frontend news submitter with RTE extension)

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is vulnerabilities present in the code of the listed third-party TYPO3 extensions, specifically:

*   Improper handling of user inputs leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data, causing XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Configuration issues and/or flawed logic resulting in information disclosure.

**Impact:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Could allow an attacker to manipulate the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or complete system compromise.
*   **XSS:** Could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This could result in session hijacking, phishing attacks, or other malicious activities.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Could expose sensitive system information or configuration data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting vulnerable input fields within the extensions by injecting malicious SQL queries.
*   **XSS:** Injecting malicious scripts into the extensions through user input, or other means, that are not properly sanitized before being displayed to other users.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing vulnerable components or resources of the extension that reveal sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable extensions, typically through the web interface of the TYPO3 CMS.
*   For SQL Injection, the attacker needs to be able to manipulate data sent to the server in a way that introduces malicious SQL code.
*  For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   The attacker would need to target a TYPO3 system using one of the vulnerable extensions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory is a "Collective Security Bulletin" (CSB) intended for less significant or widely used extensions.
*   For some extensions, updates are available via the TYPO3 Extension Manager, while others were removed from the repository and users were advised to uninstall them. This was done because the maintainers of the extensions were either unreachable or unresponsive.
* The severity is rated as "High" for SQL injection and "Medium" for XSS.
* The provided content gives more specific details on the affected extensions and types of vulnerabilities than the official CVE description.
