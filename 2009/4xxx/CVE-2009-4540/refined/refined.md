```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient filtering of user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter of the page.php script. This parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can read arbitrary data from the database, including sensitive information. Specifically, they can use `load_file()` to read files from the server. The exploit example given shows how to read the config.php file, which could contain database credentials or other sensitive information.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted GET request to the `page.php` script, by manipulating the `id` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have some knowledge of SQL. magic_quotes_gpc must be off on the server, and the attacker needs the full path to config.php file.
