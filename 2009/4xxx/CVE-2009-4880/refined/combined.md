# USN-944-1: GNU C Library vulnerabilities

25 May 2010

The GNU C library did not correctly handle certain mnt entries, strfmon
arguments, and ELF program headers.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [eglibc](/security/cves?package=eglibc) - Shared system libraries
* [glibc](/security/cves?package=glibc) - Shared system libraries

## Details

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the GNU C library did not

correctly handle integer overflows in the strfmon function. If a user

or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted

format string, a remote attacker could crash applications, leading to

a denial of service. (Ubuntu 10.04 was not affected.) ([CVE-2008-1391](/security/CVE-2008-1391))

Jeff Layton and Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did not

correctly handle newlines in the mntent family of functions. If a local

attacker were able to inject newlines into a mount entry through other

vulnerable mount helpers, they could disrupt the system or possibly gain

root privileges. ([CVE-2010-0296](/security/CVE-2010-0296))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did not correctly validate

certain ELF program headers. If a user or automated system were tricked

into verifying a specially crafted ELF program, a remote attacker could

execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2010-0830](/security/CVE-2010-0830))

Debian Bug     : 583908

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNU C Library (aka
glibc) and its derivatives. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-1391, CVE-2009-4880, CVE-2009-4881

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the GNU C library did not
correctly handle integer overflows in the strfmon family of
functions. If a user or automated system were tricked into
processing a specially crafted format string, a remote attacker
could crash applications, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2010-0296

Jeff Layton and Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did
not correctly handle newlines in the mntent family of functions. If
a local attacker were able to inject newlines into a mount entry
through other vulnerable mount helpers, they could disrupt the
system or possibly gain root privileges.

CVE-2010-0830

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did not correctly
validate certain ELF program headers.  If a user or automated system
were tricked into verifying a specially crafted ELF program, a
remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7-18lenny4 of the glibc package.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems has been fixed in
version 2.1.11-1 of the eglibc package.

We recommend that you upgrade your glibc or eglibc packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# GNU C library: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201011-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in glibc, the worst of which allowing
local attackers to execute arbitrary code as root.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/glibc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.11.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.11.2-r3** |

### Background

The GNU C library is the standard C library used by Gentoo Linux
systems.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in glibc, amongst others the
widely-known recent LD\_AUDIT and $ORIGIN issues. For further
information please consult the CVE entries referenced below.

### Impact

A local attacker could execute arbitrary code as root, cause a Denial
of Service, or gain privileges. Additionally, a user-assisted remote
attacker could cause the execution of arbitrary code, and a
context-dependent attacker could cause a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GNU C library users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/glibc-2.11.2-r3"
```

[ glibc x<=2.10.1 stdio/strfmon.c Multiple vulnerabilities ]
Author: Maksymilian Arciemowicz
Date:
- - Dis.: 10.03.2008
- - Pub.: 17.09.2009
CVE: CVE-2008-1391
Risk: High
Affected Software (tested 27.08.2009):
- - Fedora 11
- - Slackware 12.2
- - Ubuntu 9.04
- - others linux distributions
- --- 0.Description ---
strfmon -- convert monetary value to string
The strfmon() function places characters into the array pointed to by s as controlled by the string pointed to by format. No more than maxsize bytes are placed into the array.
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the % character.
SYNOPSIS:
#include <monetary.h>
ssize\_t
strfmon(char \* restrict s, size\_t maxsize, const char \* restrict format,
...);
- --- 1. glibc x<=2.10.1 stdio/strfmon.c Multiple vulnerabilities ---
In March 2008, our team has published a security note (SREASONRES:20080325) about vulnerabilities in strfmon(3) function. Issue has been officially diagnosed in NetBSD, FreeBSD and MacOSX. However, from the source code we can see that glibc is also vulnerable. We have informed glibc team. However, the description of the issue and fix was not enough for gnu team. They has changed status for BOGUS and response was:
- ---
And what exactly does an BSD implementation has to do with glibc?
- ---
Today we now, only NetBSD is secure for this. And all systems uses glibc are affected. Despite the differences in the code NetBSD libc and glibc, issue is the same but the exploit differs from that presented in (SREASONRES:20080325).
Description of the vulnerabalitie:

Description of the fix:

To present this issue in Fedora 11, we will use php client. money\_format() use strfmon(3) function so this program will be perfect.
[cx@localhost ~]$ php -r 'money\_format("%.1073741821i",1);'
Segmentation fault
for 'money\_format("%.1073741821i",1);' we will get
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

Interesting is that the PHP memory\_limit has no control over what will happens in the level of the libc. Function strfmon(3) can allocate a lot of data in memory without control by PHP memory\_limit.
For example:
php -r 'money\_format("%.1343741821i",1);'
will allocate ~1049MB real memory.
memory\_limit can be less that 1049M
Strange is the fact that nobody checked the code of glibc. The algorithm used in BSD libc and glibc is very similar. Funy.
Let's see libc/stdlib/strfmon\_l.c (glibc rev-1.5.2.4)
- ---
if (isdigit (\*fmt))
{
/\* Parse field width. \*/
width = to\_digit (\*fmt);
while (isdigit (\*++fmt))
{
int val = to\_digit (\*fmt);
if (width > LONG\_MAX / 10
|| (width == LONG\_MAX && val > LONG\_MAX % 10))
{
\_\_set\_errno (E2BIG);
return -1;
}
width = width \* 10 + val;
}
/\* If we don't have enough room for the demanded width we
can stop now and return an error. \*/
if (width >= maxsize - (dest - s))
{
\_\_set\_errno (E2BIG);
return -1;
}
}
- ---
Perfect. The above code protects us. Very funy is this comment
/\* If we don't have enough room for the demanded width we
can stop now and return an error. \*/
But what is below, is a mistake already
- ---
/\* Recognize left precision. \*/
if (\*fmt == '#')
{
if (!isdigit (\*++fmt))
{
\_\_set\_errno (EINVAL);
return -1;
}
left\_prec = to\_digit (\*fmt);
while (isdigit (\*++fmt))
{
left\_prec \*= 10;
left\_prec += to\_digit (\*fmt);
}
}
/\* Recognize right precision. \*/
if (\*fmt == '.')
{
if (!isdigit (\*++fmt))
{
\_\_set\_errno (EINVAL);
return -1;
}
right\_prec = to\_digit (\*fmt);
while (isdigit (\*++fmt))
{
right\_prec \*= 10;
right\_prec += to\_digit (\*fmt);
}
}
- ---
To overflow the left\_prec, we need only give # ( if (\*fmt == '#') ) before digits.
So, any uses like
- ---
info.prec = right\_prec;
info.width = left\_prec + (right\_prec ? (right\_prec + 1) : 0);
info.spec = 'f';
info.is\_long\_double = is\_long\_double;
info.group = group;
info.pad = pad;
info.extra = 1; /\* This means use values from LC\_MONETARY. \*/
ptr = &fpnum;
done = \_\_printf\_fp (&f.\_sbf.\_f, &info, &ptr);
- ---
are vulnerable.
