  "CVE-2009-4536": {
    "description": "drivers/net/e1000/e1000_main.c in the e1000 driver in the Linux kernel handles Ethernet frames that exceed the MTU by processing certain trailing payload data as if it were a complete frame, which allows remote attackers to bypass packet filters via a large packet with a crafted payload.",
    "root_cause": "The e1000 driver processes trailing payload data of oversized Ethernet frames as if they were a complete frame.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of oversized Ethernet frames",
      "Missing check on the validity of the full packet when processing fragments."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can bypass packet filters by sending large, crafted Ethernet packets, potentially leading to further exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted oversized Ethernet frames"
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system using the e1000 driver interface."
