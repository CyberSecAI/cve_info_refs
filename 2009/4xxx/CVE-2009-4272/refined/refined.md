{
  "CVE-2009-4272": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to a flaw in the emergency route cache flushing mechanism. When a large number of collisions occur in the routing hash table due to specially crafted packets, the emergency route flush is triggered, leading to a deadlock.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper locking during route cache flushing",
        "Uninitialized pointer in route lookup when routing cache is disabled"
      ],
      "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The deadlock caused by the emergency route flushing will freeze the node. In addition, when the kernel routing cache is disabled, an uninitialized pointer may result in a NULL pointer dereference and a kernel panic.",
      "Attack vector": "Remote attacker can send specially crafted packets to cause a large number of collisions in the routing hash table, triggering the emergency route flush.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "Ability to send network packets.",
       "Affected Component": "Linux kernel routing implementation"
    },
    "additional_details": {
      "Affected versions": "2.6.18-164.x kernels",

        "RHSA-2010:0095"
      ],
    "notes": "The vulnerability was originally reported by the Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team. The issue occurs because the spin_lock_bh is called on a disabled bottom-half context in rt_run_flush()."
