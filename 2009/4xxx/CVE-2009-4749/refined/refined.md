- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `x` parameter of the `message_box.php` and `request.php` files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Blind SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and emails, from the `chat_admin` table, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `x` parameter in `message_box.php` and `request.php` URLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They do not need prior authentication.

The provided exploit details include example URLs for testing the blind SQL injection, such as:
```
http://chat.apolloservers.com/phplive/request.php?l=admin&x=1 AND 1=1    --> True
http://chat.apolloservers.com/phplive/request.php?l=admin&x=1 AND 1=2    --> False
```
and an example of using the ASCII function to extract data:
```
http://chat.apolloservers.com/phplive/request.php?l=admin&x=1/**/and/**/ascii(substring((select/**/concat(login,0x3a,password)/**/from/**/chat_admin/**/limit/**/1,1),1,1))>48
```
The exploit also specifies the vulnerable versions: v3.2.1 & v3.2.2.
