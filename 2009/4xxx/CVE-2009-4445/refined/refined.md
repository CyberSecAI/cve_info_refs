Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2009-4445:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft IIS handles filenames containing a semicolon (;). IIS incorrectly parses filenames, specifically when a semicolon is present, treating the portion before the semicolon as the actual extension to be executed, disregarding the characters after the semicolon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect File Extension Parsing:** IIS improperly parses filenames containing semicolons, leading to the execution of unintended file types.
- **File Upload Bypass:** This weakness allows attackers to bypass file upload restrictions based on extension checks. By appending a semicolon followed by a fake extension (e.g., `.jpg`) to a malicious executable file (e.g., `.asp`), the attacker can trick the web application into accepting the file while IIS executes it as a server-side script.
- **NTFS Alternate Data Streams:** The use of a colon (:) allows for the creation of empty files with arbitrary extensions. This is due to NTFS Alternate Data Streams, and is separate from the semicolon vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Web Application Takeover:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to gain control of the vulnerable web application.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Compromised servers can be used to steal or manipulate sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Functionality:** The primary attack vector is through file upload forms or other file submission mechanisms in web applications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs the ability to upload files to a vulnerable server. This could be through a publicly accessible upload form or another entry point.
- **Basic Understanding of Web Technologies:** The attacker should understand how file extensions and web servers work, particularly regarding IIS.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects IIS versions prior to IIS 7.5, specifically IIS 6 and earlier. IIS7 has not been tested in this document.
- The vulnerability does not work with ASP.Net, because .Net technology will not recognize a file like "malicious.aspx;.jpg" as a .Net file.
- The report mentions that a measurement in 2008 showed 70% of secure file uploaders could be bypassed using this method.
- The report also specifies that the vulnerability was discovered via a simple fuzzer using ASP itself.
- The vulnerability was discovered in April 2008 and reported in December 2009.
- Recommended mitigations include randomizing filenames on the server side, restricting allowed characters in uploaded filenames and removing execute permissions from the upload directories.
