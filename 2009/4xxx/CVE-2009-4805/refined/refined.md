Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4805 (also references CVE-2009-4801)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The EZ-Blog beta1 application does not require authentication for posting or deleting content.
*   The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `view.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `storyid` parameter. An example is provided: `http://site/path/public/view.php?storyid=-1' UNION ALL SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10%23`
*   **Insecure Data Handling:**  The application does not sanitize user inputs, leading to the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The application allows unauthenticated users to perform actions such as posting, deleting content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Although the database does not contain "high reserved information", SQL injection could potentially be used to extract data if sensitive data exists.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker can delete all posts in the blog by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability in the remove.php script
*   **Denial of Service:** Deletion of posts would disrupt normal blog function and user experience.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** SQL injection via the `storyid` parameter in the `view.php` script using HTTP GET method.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** Exploitation to delete all posts by submitting a specifically crafted form via HTTP POST request to `remove.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious queries.
*   **Magic Quotes Disabled:** The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting on the server must be off for the SQL injection to be exploitable.
