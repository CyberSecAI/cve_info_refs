{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DHOST web service of Novell eDirectory 8.8.5 generates predictable session cookies.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Predictable session cookies allow for session hijacking.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can hijack a legitimate user's session by predicting their cookie value.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker runs a module to predict the next session cookie value. After a real administrator logs in, the attacker uses the predicted cookie to hijack the session.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the DHOST web service and have the ability to use the predicted cookie value."
