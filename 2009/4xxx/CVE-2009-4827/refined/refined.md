{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper CSRF protection in Mail Manager Pro.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can remotely change the administrator's password.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is done through a crafted HTML form that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, changes their password without their consent. The attacker needs the administrator to visit the attacker's page, which contains the malicious HTML code.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged in administrator into visiting the page containing the crafted form. They do not need to be logged into the Mail Manager Pro application, but rather the administrator does. "
