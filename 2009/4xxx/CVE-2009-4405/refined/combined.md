How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Release Notes for Trac 0.11.6 Genshi Release

November 28, 2009

Trac 0.11.6 contains two security fixes and a number of bug fixes,
performance improvements and minor enhancements.

## Changes in 0.11.6

> * Fixed the policy checks in report results when using alternate formats.
> * Added a check for the "raw" role that is missing in docutils < 0.6.
> * Re-enabled connection pooling with SQLite (#3446).
> * Added caching of configuration options (#8510).
> * Fixed the "database is locked" issue with SQLite (#3446, #8468).
> * Deprecated SQLite 2.x support (#8625).
> * Fixed hanlding of times in timezones with DST (#8240).
> * Avoid corruption of trac.ini during write (#8623).
> * Improved support for revision ranges in the revision log view (#8349)

## Highlights in 0.11

> * New template engine for generating content (Genshi)
> * New configurable workflow in the ticket subsystem
> * Finer-grained control of permissions
> * Support for Pygments as the default syntax highlighter
> * Improved repository browser ("blame" support, dynamic in-place
>   expansion of folders)
> * Improved user preferences subsystem, among which the possibility for
> * any user to select their time zone and disable access keys
> * The WebAdmin plugin is now an integral part of Trac
> * Paging of timeline and query results.

# Detailed User Visible Changes

## User Preferences

A new user preference module has been added. It presents by default
several panels and plugins can easily add their own user settings there:

> * General (name and e-mail information)
> * Date & Time (timezone)
> * Keyboard Shortcuts (enable/disable)
> * Pygments Theme
> * Advanced (restore session)

Most significantly, support for setting the time zone has been added to
the Date & Time panel.

Each user can select which time zone they want timestamps to be presented
in. If pytz is installed a complete list of time zones will be available,
otherwise Trac will fall back on a shorter list from an internal time
zone implementation.

## Wiki

> * Usability improvements:
>   + possibility to review changes before saving a new version of a page
>   + basic handling of conflicts in case of concurrent edits
>   + Restored direct link to History and revert to an Index link, from
>     where it's easy to switch between the Index by Title and Index by
>     Date
>   + The [[PageOutline]] macro now works as expected in preview mode
> * Wiki syntax improvements:
>   + most TracLinks now accept trailing arguments (?...) and targets
>     (#...)
>   + more intuitive relative links ([.. parent page], [./OtherPage
>     sibling page], [/WikiStart toplevel page])
>   + relative links like [#anchor see this section] always link to the
>     proper originating page or ticket, irrelevant from where the wiki
>     text appears (e.g. in the timeline)
>   + new #!div wiki processor and new [[span]] macro added. The former
>     can be used to encapsulate an arbitrary block of wiki markup in a
>     <div> element. The second can be used to encapsulate an arbitrary
>     fragment of wiki markup in a <span> element. Both div and span
>     can be provided with attributes like class=... or style="...".
>   + [[Image]] macro can now "link" to an arbitrary TracLinks instead
>     of the image's attachment itself
>   + InterTrac prefixes written alone can be used to target the
>     default page in the remote Trac, e.g. [TracHacks: the site for
>     contributing Trac plugins]
>   + trac: InterTrac prefix is known by default and refers to the
>     "Trac for Trac"

## Ticket System

Ticket Editing

> * The ticket workflow is now configurable, see TracWorkflow
> * Improved preview, showing the comment preview at the top of the page,
>   so one can see at the same time the preview of the comment and the
>   preview of the fields and the description in the ticket box
> * It is now possible to examine the changes made to the ticket
>   description and textual custom fields
> * The display of field changes has been improved and is now more
>   compact
> * Major usability enhancement for the CC: field
> * Like for the concurrent wiki edits, a conflict due to simultaneous
>   editing of a ticket by two or more users lead to warnings, minimizing
>   the risk for the user to lose his changes
> * Syntax for linking to arbitrary ticket comments is now more
>   intuitive: use comment:3:ticket:123 for linking to the 3^rd comment
>   of ticket #123. Alternatively, you can write: ticket:123#comment:3
>   (but not #123#comment:3!)

Roadmap and Milestone

> * The Milestones can now have attachments
> * If needed, it is possible to configure additional ticket groups to be
>   shown in the milestone progress bar (according to the status). For
>   even more complex needs, a plugin can now take over the way the
>   tickets and stats are collected.

Reports and Custom Queries

> * Improved custom queries:
>   + columns can now be selected
>   + possibility to save custom queries as reports
>   + possibility to configure the default custom query, both for
>   + anonymous and authenticated users
> * the [[TicketQuery]] now supports a format=table option, which will
>   produce the usual tabular result of a custom query, see the macro
>   documentation.
> * the custom query can list a fixed set of tickets, either using the
>   [[TicketQuery]] macro or query: links

## Repository Browser

> * "Blame" support (annotation of every line with the changeset which
>   last modified them)
> * Dynamically expandable folders for Javascript enabled browsers
> * "Quickjump" navigation menu for easily going to branches and tags
> * Alternative text view on diffs for Javascript enabled browsers
> * Significantly improved patch renderer (supports extended diff
>   formats)
> * Support for svn:externals and other properties. Improved display of
>   property changes. In addition, support for custom properties can be
>   added through plugins.
> * Add the ability to highlight arbitrary ranges of lines in the source
>   code, using the appropriate source TracLinks
> * Add the ability to access to the raw content of files inside the
>   repository using export TracLinks.
> * Revision log display is more compact and allows selecting a diff for
>   the whole range of specified revisions
> * Changeset display of list of files is more compact as well and shows
>   the main location where the changes happened. That can also be done
>   in the timeline by setting the [timeline] changeset\_show\_files
>   configuration entry to location instead of a number.

## General

Setuptools is now used for the packaging

This means you'll be able to just do

easy\_install Trac

once we've made the release.

It also means that a number of things had to be changed to make this work
correctly. In particular, Trac no longer implicitly assumes nor installs
global data in the $prefix/share/trac. Instead, you'll have to modify the
configuration of your project environments to explicitly “inherit” a
global configuration in trac.ini, for example:

[inherit]
file = /etc/trac/trac.ini

This will load the configuration from the /etc/trac/trac.ini file, while
of course allowing to override any global settings in the environment's
configuration.

In that global configuration, you can specify shared directories for
templates and plugins, e.g.:

[inherit]
plugins\_dir = /etc/trac/plugins/
templates\_dir = /etc/trac/templates/

> Note: naming of these options may still change until the final 0.11
> release

Improved Syntax Highlighting

Trac can now use the Pygments syntax highlighter out-of-the-box. This is
a much nicer syntax highlighter than the one previously supported (
SilverCity, Enscript and PHP).

Lots of other minor improvements

> * all configuration changes made to the TracIni files are now taken
>   into account immediately, without the need for a server restart
> * e-mail obfuscation everywhere turned on by default (can be disabled
>   project wide or on a per-user basis
> * possibility to configure the navigation bars (see TracNavigation)
> * Timeline improvements:
>   + paging support
>   + remember user settings
>   + more configuration settings for tweaking the display of the
>     events (see TracIni#timeline-section)
> * Search improvements:
>   - OpenSearch support

## Caveats

> * It is strongly advised to set the [trac] base\_url setting for
>   generating correct URLs outside the context of a user request.
>   However, contrary to what happened for a while in 0.10.5dev, this
>   setting won't be used for the redirects, unless Trac is explicitly
>   told to do so, with the use\_base\_url\_for\_redirect setting.
> * The [trac] templates\_dir setting is considered harmful... You
>   probably need to remove that setting when you browse Trac and get the
>   following plain text error:
>
>   TemplateNotFound: Template "error.html" not found
>
>   FIXME: is this still the case?
> * The support for MySQL as a database backend has not improved
>   significantly in any ways... It is still considered to be
>   experimental for 0.11. YMMV.
> * The usual trick of wrapping a piece of wiki text inside a <div> for
>   advanced custom formatting can't be done anymore using the #!html
>   WikiProcessor, as that one can only produce well-formed HTML
>   fragments. Instead, one must use the new #!div Wiki processor for
>   that.

Wiki Macros

The change in templating engines necessitated a change in wiki macros.
The HelloWorld and Timestamp macros which are distributed with trac will
not work as released.

For examples of new style macros, see some of the macros which have
already been ported at MacroBazaar or ports of HelloWorld and Timestamp
attached to #5274.

# Developer-visible changes

Many changes happened under the hood, among them:

> * Trac now uses the Genshi template engine instead of ClearSilver.
>   Plugins using the latter will still be supported in Trac 0.11, but
>   probably not longer.
> * Trac used to handle time informations as int timestamps. Now we're
>   using datetime objects.

A detailed view of the API changes since 0.10.x can be found in TracDev/
ApiChanges/0.11.

## Acknowledgements

Many thanks to the growing number of people who have, and continue to,
support the project. Also our thanks to all people providing feedback and
bug reports that helps us making Trac better, easier to use and more
effective.

Without your invaluable help, Trac would not evolve. Thank you all.

Finally, we offer hope that Trac will prove itself useful to like-minded
programmers around the world, and that this release will prove an
improvement over the last version.

Please let us know. :-)
