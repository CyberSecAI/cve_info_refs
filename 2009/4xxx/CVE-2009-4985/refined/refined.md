Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4985 (and CVE-2009-4984)

**Vulnerable Software:** AccessoriesMe PHP Affiliate Script v1.4

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Blind SQL Injection (bSQL):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `browse.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection in the `SearchIndex` parameter.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization/validation of user-supplied input in the `SearchIndex` parameter allows the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database, bypass authentication, or compromise the server.
    *  **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious `SearchIndex` parameter in a `GET` request.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the `browse.php` script.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `search.php` and `browse.php` scripts are vulnerable to XSS in the `Keywords` and `SearchIndex` parameters, respectively.
    *  **Weakness**: User input is not properly sanitized before being displayed in the web page.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which is executed in the victim's browser. This allows for session hijacking, defacement, redirection, or other malicious actions.
    *  **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious `Keywords` or `SearchIndex` parameter in a `GET` request containing JavaScript code.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request to the `search.php` or `browse.php` script.

*   **bSQL:**
    *   `http://127.0.0.1/browse.php?SearchIndex=PCHardware&BrowseNode=[NB]&sort=psrank&Go=[bSQL]`
    *   `http://ipod.accessories.me.uk/browse.php?SearchIndex=PCHardware&BrowseNode=3221551&sort=psrank&Go=Submit and 1=1 TRUE`
    *   `http://ipod.accessories.me.uk/browse.php?SearchIndex=PCHardware&BrowseNode=3221551&sort=psrank&Go=Submit and 1=2 FALSE`
