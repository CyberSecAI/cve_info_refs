The provided content is related to CVE-2009-4396.

**CVE-2009-4396** is a collective security bulletin that addresses multiple vulnerabilities found in various third-party TYPO3 extensions. The vulnerabilities include SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Information Disclosure.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
    *   Affected extensions: car, xds_staff, danp_documentdirs, ste_prayer2, pd_resources, hs_religiousartgallery, ste_parish_admin, pd_calendar, slideshow, mf_subscription, no_indexed_search, jobexchange.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   Affected extensions: dr_blob, nl_listman, ste_prayer2, pd_resources, hs_religiousartgallery, ste_parish_admin, pd_calendar, no_indexed_search, trainincdb, zid_linklist, vshoutbox, fe_rtenews.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   Affected extension: aba_watchdog.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to data, and complete control over the database.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the website, and unauthorized actions performed on behalf of users.
*  **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to further attacks or privacy breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerabilities exist within the third-party TYPO3 extensions themselves.
*   Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting malicious requests to the vulnerable extensions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable TYPO3 instance.
*   For XSS vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to inject malicious scripts through the vulnerable extensions and have a user view the injected content.
*   For SQL Injection, the attacker manipulates input fields to inject SQL queries.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bulletin mentions that some vulnerable extensions have been removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository and users are advised to uninstall and delete them.
*   The bulletin also recommends following the TYPO3 SECURITY Guide and subscribing to the typo3-announce mailing list for future security advisories.
