{
  "CVE-2009-4030": {
    "description": "MySQL allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are originally associated with pathnames without symlinks, and that can point to tables created at a future time at which a pathname is modified to contain a symlink to a subdirectory of the MySQL data home directory.",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks on symlinks used in the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY clauses of CREATE TABLE statements.",
    "impact": "A local user could exploit this to bypass privilege checks, access and modify other users' tables. They could potentially overwrite existing files, leading to data corruption or unauthorized modification.",
    "attack_vector": "Local Access: An attacker needs the ability to connect to the MySQL server as a legitimate user, to issue create table statements.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated local user with privileges to create tables within a database.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause is an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2079, where the check for symlinks was only performed at table-creation time and not at table-opening time. It didn't handle the data directory path name correctly if it contained symlinked directories."
