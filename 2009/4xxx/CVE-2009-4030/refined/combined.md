How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- dovecot12
Huge mail headers could cause dovecot to consume excessive amounts of CPU
cycles. (CVE-2010-0745)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- cacti
Missing input sanitation in the template export feature allowed for SQL
injection attacks (CVE-2010-1431).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
java-1\_6\_0-openjdk version 1.7.3 fixes serveral security issues:
- CVE-2010-0837: JAR 'unpack200' must verify input parameters
- CVE-2010-0845: No ClassCastException for HashAttributeSet constructors
if run with -Xcomp
- CVE-2010-0838: CMM readMabCurveData Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
- CVE-2010-0082: Loader-constraint table allows arrays instead of only
the base-classes
- CVE-2010-0095: Subclasses of InetAddress may incorrectly interpret
network addresses
- CVE-2010-0085: File TOCTOU deserialization vulnerability
- CVE-2010-0091: Unsigned applet can retrieve the dragged information

- CVE-2010-0092: AtomicReferenceArray causes SIGSEGV->SEGV\_MAPERR error
- CVE-2010-0094: Deserialization of RMIConnectionImpl objects should
enforce stricter checks
- CVE-2010-0093: System.arraycopy unable to reference elements beyond
Integer.MAX\_VALUE bytes
- CVE-2010-0840: Applet Trusted Methods Chaining Privilege Escalation
Vulnerability
- CVE-2010-0848: AWT Library Invalid Index Vulnerability
- CVE-2010-0847: ImagingLib arbitrary code execution vulnerability
- CVE-2009-3555: TLS: MITM attacks via session renegotiation
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- irssi
irssi did not check the identity information of a remote hosts's certi-
ficate. Attackers could exploit that for a man-in-the-middle attack
(CVE-2010-1155).
irssi could crash if someone changed nick while the victim was leaving
the channel (CVE-2010-1156).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- tar
A malicious remote tape server could cause a buffer overflow in tar.
In order to exploit that an attacker would have to trick the victim
to extract a file that causes tar to open a connection to the rmt
server (CVE-2010-0624). It's advisable to always use tar's
--force-local local option to avoid such tricks.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- fuse
This update adds additional improvements to avoid a race condition in
fusermount that allowed users to umount any filesystem (related to
CVE-2009-3297). Thanks to Al Viro who found it.
Additionally a race condition in fusermount was fixed that allowed non-
privileged users to umount any file system (CVE-2010-0789).
Note: this is a re-release of the previous update with a better patch.
SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: mysql-5.1.41

The new mysql release mentions two security issues that has been addressed,
anyone knows more about that? I guess it would need some CVE assignment as
well.

Hi Josh,

   looked further into these issues.

A, wrt <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167>

You are right, that  CVE-2008-2079 was originally assigned to:
    <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167>

On "[6 May 2008 11:16] Sergei Golubchik" states:

please, note in the manual that it's CVE-2008-2079

But last comment on this bug mentions:

<quote>

[12 Nov 4:50] Paul DuBois

Noted in 5.1.41, 5.5.0, 6.0.14 changelogs.

Additional corrections were made for the symlink-related privilege
problem originally addressed in MySQL 5.1.24. The original fix did
not correctly handle the data directory path name if it contained
symlinked directories in its path, and the check was made only at
table-creation time, not at table-opening time later.

</quote>

Also MySQL-5.1.41 news file now contains:

Important Change: Security Fix: Additional
corrections were made for the symlink-related
privilege problem originally addressed in MySQL
5.1.24. The original fix did not correctly handle
the data directory path name if it contained
symlinked directories in its path, and the check
was made only at table-creation time, not at
table-opening time later. (Bug#32167, CVE-2008-2079)"

Consequence:
===========

So I think we will need a new CVE id as incomplete fix for CVE-2009-2079.
Relevant patch is here (2845 Georgi Kodinov	2009-11-03)
   <http://lists.mysql.com/commits/89940>

Cc-ed MySQL security team to confirm this assumption.

B, wrt to <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=39277>

   This is potential security issue, but the proposed patch didn't
made it neither into 5.0.88, nor into 5.1.41 releases.
In fact it was committed only to 6.0.9-alpha release
("Pushed into 6.0.9-alpha" comment from that bug).
So we will need to wait a little bit for patch "stabilization".

Conclusion - so two CVE ids are needed:
---------------------------------------
1, One for incomplete fix for CVE-2009-2079 issue) --
    "and the check was made only at table-creation time, not at table-opening time later"

      <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167>
      <http://lists.mysql.com/commits/89940>

2, The second one for the "MySQL clients linked against OpenSSL did not check
    server certificates presented by a server linked against yaSSL" issue

      <http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47320>

Sergei, please confirm / disprove the above.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

Not confirming :)
The patch you referenced has a changeset comment
"
  Fixed a initialization order remark by Serg : correct directory
  expansion order implemented on server startup.
"

And it fixes a problem mentined in my bug comment from [14 Jul 15:53].

The changelog entry you quoted above goes up to bug comment from
[25 Nov 2008 17:26] (no, I don't know why it took a year to get it to
the manual). And the "original fix" is apparently this one:

<http://lists.mysql.com/commits/43206> (from 2008-02-29)

while the "additional" is this:

<http://lists.mysql.com/commits/52326> (from 2008-08-22)

> Conclusion - so two CVE ids are needed:
> ---------------------------------------
> 1, One for incomplete fix for CVE-2009-2079 issue) --

cannot this one go under existing CVE ?

Sergei

Package        : mysql-dfsg-5.0
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-4019 CVE-2009-4030 CVE-2009-4484

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL
database server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2009-4019

Domas Mituzas discovered that mysqld does not properly handle errors during
execution of certain SELECT statements with subqueries, and does not preserve
certain null_value flags during execution of statements that use the
GeomFromWKB function, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a
denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted statement.

CVE-2009-4030

Sergei Golubchik discovered that MySQL allows local users to bypass certain
privilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified
DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are originally associated
with pathnames without symlinks, and that can point to tables created at
a future time at which a pathname is modified to contain a symlink to a
subdirectory of the MySQL data home directory.

CVE-2009-4484

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the CertDecoder::GetName function
in src/asn.cpp in TaoCrypt in yaSSL before 1.9.9, as used in mysqld, allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(memory corruption and daemon crash) by establishing an SSL connection and
sending an X.509 client certificate with a crafted name field.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch12

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.51a-24+lenny3

The testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution do not contain
mysql-dfsg-5 anymore.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- mysql
- local users could delete data files for tables of other users
(CVE-2010-1626).
- authenticated users could gather information for tables they
should not have access to (CVE-2010-1849)
- authenticated users could crash mysqld (CVE-2010-3683,
CVE-2010-3681, CVE-2010-1848)

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.

# USN-897-1: MySQL vulnerabilities

10 February 2010

MySQL vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)

## Packages

* [mysql-dfsg-5.0](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.0) -
* [mysql-dfsg-5.1](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.1) -

## Details

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use the DATA

DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege checks.

This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the use of the

MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 8.10. ([CVE-2008-4098](/security/CVE-2008-4098))

It was discovered that MySQL contained a cross-site scripting vulnerability

in the command-line client when the --html option is enabled. An attacker

could place arbitrary web script or html in a database cell, which would

then get placed in the html document output by the command-line tool. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04.

([CVE-2008-4456](/security/CVE-2008-4456))

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use symlinks

combined with the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly

bypass privilege checks. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10.

([CVE-2008-7247](/security/CVE-2008-7247))

It was discovered that MySQL contained multiple format string flaws when

logging database creation and deletion. An authenticated user could use

specially crafted database names to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of

service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04.

([CVE-2009-2446](/security/CVE-2009-2446))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled errors when performing

certain SELECT statements, and did not preserve correct flags when

performing statements that use the GeomFromWKB function. An authenticated

user could exploit this to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of service.

([CVE-2009-4019](/security/CVE-2009-4019))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly checked symlinks when using the

DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. A local user could use symlinks

to create tables that pointed to tables known to be created at a later

time, bypassing access restrictions. ([CVE-2009-4030](/security/CVE-2009-4030))

It was discovered that MySQL contained a buffer overflow when parsing

ssl certificates. A remote attacker could send crafted requests and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue did not

affect Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and the default compiler options for affected

releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. In the

default installation, attackers would also be isolated by the AppArmor

MySQL profile. ([CVE-2009-4484](/security/CVE-2009-4484))

Description:
When one creates a MyISAM table with

   CREATE TABLE ( ) DATA DIRECTORY ... INDEX DIRECTORY ...

there're special checks to ensure that existing tables are not overwritten via symlinks. That is, one cannot create a 'user' table in the 'test' db, with DATA DIRECTORY pointing to 'mysql' db.

When one creates a table without symlinks, existing files are overwritten. It is intentional too.

But it creates a problem similar to "insecure tempfile creation" - an attacker can create a table with MYD/MYI files in another database, and if another user will later create a table in that database with the same name, the attacker will be able to access the table bypassing privilege checks.

How to repeat:
root> grant all privileges on test.* to test@localhost;

test> create table t1 (a int) data directory '/MySQL/var/mysql', index directory '/MySQL/var/mysql';

root> flush tables;
root> create table t1 (a int);
root> insert t1 values (1),(2),(3);
root> flush tables;

test> select * from t1;

Suggested fix:
don't allow symlinks into datadir

Documented bugfix in the 4.1.24, 5.0.60, 5.1.24, and 6.0.5 changelogs as follows:

        It was possible to circumvent privileges through the creation of
        MyISAM tables employing the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY
        options to overwrite existing table files in the MySQL data
        directory. Use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and
        INDEX DIRECTORY is now disallowed.

In addition, the changelog entries for 5.1.24 and 6.0.5 includes the statement:

                                           This is also true for partitioned

At least some of the patches attached to this bug do not appear to be sufficient to address the vulnerability.  Commit#38278 and #38623 call fn_format() with MY_RETURN_REAL_PATH but not MY_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS; this will cause my_realpath (as it appears in 5.0.51b) to rely entirely on an lstat() check to determine whether the given target is a symlink.  This is insufficient because an attacker can supply the path to a real directory underneath a symlink (e.g. /tmp/{foo -> /var/lib}/mysql) without triggering a simple lstat().

Commit #38680 and #38704 are even worse, in that besides the above problem, they then discard the output of fn_format() entirely, reusing the original input for comparison against the mysql data homedir.

Commit #38932, #38937, #38952, #39513, #40134, #41636, #43143 and #43206 are a mix of these -- they pass MY_RETURN_REAL_PATH to fn_format(), but then ignore its output.

Note that my reading of these patches is based on 5.0.51b and 5.0.32's implementations of fn_format() as a reference; I've tested that backports of #38680/38704 to these versions do not correct the vulnerability, but am only doing a visual reading of the others.
```

Also, the check is not sufficient. test_if_data_home_dir() should be called every time the table is opened, not only when it's created.

After a discussion with other members of the Debian security team, I wanted to pass on a request that you consider a non-path based solution to this issue, at least on operating systems where one is feasible.

There are two basic problems with the path-based fix to this bug employed thus far.  First and most simply, it only works to protect database users who store their data/index files under the mysql data root (whether by deliberate act or by default).  Users who store a table's files outside that path (e.g. to manage disk resources) are still vulnerable to attack.

Secondly, on many operating systems paths aren't a reliable mapping to files.  Linux, for example, supplies bind mounts, where a subset of one filesystem can be made to appear in another location.  There is no symlinking, and a realpath() called on a file in a bind mount will not return the path from the "source" filesystem.  The unionfs feature in FreeBSD, Linux and Plan9 present the same problem, and MacOS' recently-added directory hardlinks probably do as well.  Most of these cases require sysadmin/DBA intervention to bring about the preconditions for the attack, but while unusual are hardly unprecedented.

Under most conditions, the proper fix would be to create new files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL and not try to control path usage.  However, in mysql's particular case this turns an authorization check bypass weakness into a DoS weakness -- though it might be the only viable option for supporting arbitrary user-supplied paths outside the mysql data directory.  For protection within the data directory, you might consider doing inode-based checks based on device+inode number, which are stable at least across bind mounts.  Or you could make passing DATA/INDEX DIRECTORY clauses to CREATE TABLE statements a privileged operation in itself.
```

[14 Jul 2008 11:13]
Sergei Golubchik
```
There's an option to create new files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL. See mysqld --help for keep_files_on_create.

I'm not sure I understand your device+inode idea - does it mean the server would need to scan all databases in the datadir to know all inode numbers of all tables ?
```

Christian Hammers

Hello Sergey

I guess this would indeed mean that MySQL would have to do a stat() call for every directory. Something like:
"find /var/lib/mysql -type d -printf "%D %i %p\n"

bye,

-christian-
```

[17 Jul 2008 5:35]
Devin Carraway
```
If you're trying to protect the mysql data directory and its descendants, then you can do so with a stat() call on that directory, then on each component of the user-supplied index/data directory path (hence for /tmp/foo/bar: /tmp, /tmp/foo, /tmp/foo/bar).  If any of the supplied path's ancestors or the path itself match the mysql data dir, then the user has supplied a path in or under it.  This would not protect databases with data/index dirs outside the mysql root -- for that you'd have to check for a nonempty intersection between the inodes of the components of the user-supplied path and those of each data/index dir used by every other database within that mysqld.

There are a number of potential race conditions in such a check, though they apply equally to a path-based readlink() or realpath() check as well.  Essentially, if mysqld creates the table's data files under a user-controlled path after checking for its validity, then you're not guaranteed that the path used for the create is the same one you checked.  For an attacker trying to exploit the race condition, the odds aren't too shabby, and they can retry as many times as they like until they succeed.

Since there isn't an atomic stat-directory-and-open-file-therein system call in UNIX, to avoid the race may require an ownership-based lstat() check as well, to assure that there aren't any components of the path writable by users other than mysqld's own and root.  And the operation might need to be performed under a global lock so as to protect against races with table storage paths as well.  It sucks, but it might be the price of admission for a feature like this one.
```

[17 Jul 2008 7:33]
Sergei Golubchik
```
So far we're still implementing readlink/realpath solution.

For a bind mounts, for example, we say that it's DBA problem - in particular, if he has made two different paths /a/b/c/d and /e/f/g/h to refer to the same file, he himself needs to make sure that one of these paths is unreadable for mysql user (user, mysqld is running as), e.g. set permissions on c/ directory appropriately.

A simple solution to fix races is to check a path with a realpath, and then use the *expanded* , "real" path to access a file, not the original one.

      [Bug#32167](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=32167) another privilege bypass with DATA/INDEX DIRECTORY.

      test_if_data_home_dir fixed to look into real path.
      Checks added to mi_open for symlinks into data home directory.
```

[18 Jul 2008 7:43]
Devin Carraway
```
Sorry I didn't get to this earlier, but using realpath()'s return value won't work either if the attacker controls any of the components of the (real) path.  Here's a PoC illustrating why, using a mysqld patched to use a realpath() call.  At the time the test_if_data_home_dir() check is run, the path given involves no symlinks at all and does not refer to the mysql data dir.  But by the time the table's files are actually created, the path now includes a symlink to another database's data directory, and the files end up there.

Starting conditions were two empty databases, test1 and test2, with a user allowed to create in t1 but not in t2, and a root user that can create in t2.

First, as the test user:

[etch-amd64] aqua@kesha:/tmp
$ rm -rf directory && umask 0 && mkdir directory && ls -ld directory
drwxrwxrwx 2 aqua 1000 1024 Jul 18 07:17 directory
[etch-amd64] aqua@kesha:/tmp
$ mysql -p test1
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 6
Server version: 5.0.32-Debian_7etch6-log Debian etch distribution

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> create table t1 (a int) data directory '/tmp/directory/' index directory '/tmp/directory/' ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)

mysql>
[1]+  Stopped                 mysql -p test1
[etch-amd64] aqua@kesha:/tmp
$ mysql -p test1
[etch-amd64] aqua@kesha:/tmp
$ rm -rf directory && ln -s /var/lib/mysql/test2 directory && ls -ld directory
lrwxrwxrwx 1 aqua 1000 20 Jul 18 07:17 directory -> /var/lib/mysql/test2

Then, as the root user, in the test2 db:

mysql> create table t1 (a int) ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)

And as the test user, back in test1:

mysql> insert into t1 values (1),(2),(3) ;
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

Finally, over in test2:

mysql> select * from t1 ;
+------+
| a    |
+------+
|    1 |
|    2 |
|    3 |
+------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

Sorry I didn't think of that earlier.  Finally, keep in mind that realpath() isn't atomic -- it's an iteration over lstat() and readlink(); if part of it is replaced with a symlink after the iteration has passed that part, realpath() won't tell you:

00:37:31.512490 getcwd("/tmp"..., 4096) = 5 <0.000016>
00:37:31.512581 lstat("/tmp/a", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0 <0.000019>
/* inject rename("a", "a.old"); symlink("/var/lib/mysql", "a"); */
00:37:31.512706 lstat("/tmp/a/b", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0 <0.000017>
```

[18 Jul 2008 7:48]
Devin Carraway
```
BTW, reading over that checkin, by putting a realpath check into the open call you narrow the window of vulnerability considerably -- just keep in mind that symlinks can be anywhere in a path, while lstat() only checks the last component.
```

[18 Jul 2008 8:44]
Sergei Golubchik
```
Right, that's precisely why we moved the check to the place where a file is *opened*, not where it's *created* - to stop attacks like the one you described.

Noted in 5.0.67 changelog.

It was possible to circumvent privileges through the creation of
MyISAM tables employing the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY
options to overwrite existing table files in the MySQL data
directory. Use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and
INDEX DIRECTORY pathname is now disallowed.

Leaving report in Patch Approved status.

For the record, here's a summary history of fixes for this bug:

* Original fix applied to 4.1.24, 5.0.60, 5.1.24, 6.0.5
* Secondary fix applied to 4.1.25, 5.0.70, 5.1.28, 6.0.6
* Original fix applied to first Community release following 5.0.60 (i.e., 5.0.67)
* Original + secondary fixes applied to 5.0.66sp1 Service Pack release

Description for the secondary fix:

Additional corrections were made for the symlink-related privilege
problem originally addressed. The original fix did not correctly
handle the data directory pathname if it contained symlinked
directories in its path, and the check was made only at
table-creation time, not at table-opening time later.

reopened, the fix had a bug: in mysqld.cc, fix_paths() mysql_unpacked_real_data_home was calculated from mysql_real_data_home *before* mysql_real_data_home itself was expanded. For example when mysql_real_data_home was specified as a relative path, mysql_unpacked_real_data_home was interpreting it relatively to a pwd(), not to a mysql_home.

Noted in 5.1.41, 5.5.0, 6.0.14 changelogs.

Additional corrections were made for the symlink-related privilege
problem originally addressed in MySQL 5.1.24. The original fix did
not correctly handle the data directory path name if it contained
symlinked directories in its path, and the check was made only at
table-creation time, not at table-opening time later.

Can anyone confirm that "Fixed a initialization order remark by Serg" fix is what is referred to in 5.1.41 release notes (and also in .24 and .28 as "additional fix in .41")?  The fix is committed in 5.1 bazaar branch:

<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~mysql/mysql-server/mysql-5.1/revision/1810.3967.4>

but it does not seem to have made it to 5.1.41.  Am I missing some other change?

Tomas,

Yes, it should be out with 5.1.42.

Further note ... although it's claimed above that the last fix (change of order of operations) was pushed into 5.0.88, I see no such change in the released 5.0.95 tarball.

Just small correction - CVE-2008-2079 should be listed of course in
all occurrences below (focused on proper links) and made
two typos :(.
