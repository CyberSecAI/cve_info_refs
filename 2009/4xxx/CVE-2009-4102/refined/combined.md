# Zero-day vulnerabilities in Firefox extensions discovered

![](https://img2.helpnetsecurity.com/articles/firefoxbroken.jpg)One of the reasons behind Firefox’s popularity is the availability of a vast library of extensions. Users use them to modify the browser to their liking and make their browsing experience easier and more pleasant. The problem is, unbeknown to them, these extensions are exposing them to risk.

At the [SecurityByte & OWASP AppSec Conference](http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=8514) in India, Roberto Suggi Liverani and Nick Freeman, security consultants with [security-assessment.com](http://security-assessment.com/), offered insight into the substantial danger posed by Firefox extensions.

![](https://img2.helpnetsecurity.com/articles/rsl.jpg)

Mozilla doesn’t have a security model for extensions and Firefox fully trusts the code of the extensions. There are no security boundaries between extensions and, to make things even worse, an extension can silently modify another extension.

Any Mozilla application with the extension system is vulnerable to same type of issues. Extensions vulnerabilities are platform independent, and can result in full system compromise.

The researchers believe that the weakest link in the chain is the human factor. Many add-on developers do it for a hobby and are not necessarily aware of how dangerous a vulnerable extension can be. The extension reviewers don’t need to have great knowledge about Web application security and follow guidelines on finding malicious extensions. This means vulnerable extensions can easily slip through.

Researchers have found several bugs in popular Firefox extensions that have an estimate total amount of 30 million downloads from AMO (Addons Mozilla community site). Three 0days were also released at the SecurityByte & Owasp AppSec Asia 2009 conference.

**Sage 1.4.3 and previous**

HTML and JavaScript in the <description> tags of RSS feeds is executed in the chrome security zone. There is no filtering or protection.

![](https://img2.helpnetsecurity.com/articles/sageoday.jpg)

When you click on a malicious feed, it changes your NoScript settings and introduces the website in question on the whitelist of websites that are allowed to execute scripts.

**InfoRSS 1.1.4.2 and previous**

HTML and JavaScript in the <description> tags of RSS feeds is executed in the chrome security zone.

![](https://img2.helpnetsecurity.com/articles/inforssoday.jpg)

JavaScript is encoded in base64 or used as the source of an iframe and is executed automatically when the malicious feed items are scrolling in the status bar. At the same moment, remote attacker running [BeEF](http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=8154) (Browser Exploitation Framework) can start using the remote computer as its own zombie. By sending a set of remote commands, attacker gains full access to the computer.

**Yoono 6.1.0 and previous**

JavaScript in DOM event handlers such as onLoad is evaluated in the chrome privileged browser zone.

![](https://img2.helpnetsecurity.com/articles/yoonoday.jpg)

Yoono is free software that allows you to connect and share with all your social networks and instant messaging services in one place. By using this extension, users can quickly save and share images from other web sites.

The problem here is that when using the extension on a malicious web site, remote file can be automatically downloaded and executed on your machine. Reverse VNC is just one of the options that can lead to the full compromise.

Speaking for Help Net Security, security researcher Roberto Suggi Liverani discusses his findings:

Sage 1.4.3, the current version available at addons.mozilla.org, <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/77> , has had a known serious vulnerability for 1.5 years. Now it has been publicized on Slashdot, yet the extension is still avalable at a.m.o. with the slightest of warnings ("Let me install this experimental add-on"). This is wrong, wrong.

[http://it.slashdot.org/story/09/11/20/1 ... Extensions](http://it.slashdot.org/story/09/11/20/1257232/Zero-Day-Vulnerabilities-In-Firefox-Extensions)
<http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=8527>

The author of the extension has been repeatedly told by Mozilla's people on Bugzilla how to fix the problem, which allows malicious RSS feeds to control the browser's chrome and own the user's computer, but he continues to apply half fixes in order to allow better "user experience". The Mozilla people continue to allow him to delay applying a real fix, and meanwhile allow the extension to stay on a.m.o with the checkbox warning!

Questions:
\* Why should a.m.o. host this sort of flawed extension, however popular?
\* Can Mozilla actively disable this extension if installed, or is that only for bad plugins?

AMO is already at work trying to resolve the problem, however the bug that tracks this issue at Mozilla's Bugzilla is marked as security-sensitive. Once this security-sensitive bug is resolved, Sage will either be acted against OR remain as is if by chance the author gets a security update out that fixes the security issue before the AMO staff is left no choice but to take action.

Sage has been given many chances, so since AMO is only now taking action, Sage's author has one last chance to save the add-on from being acted against.

EDIT - Update: Sage has been removed from public on AMO and relegated to the Sandbox. Which means Sage's author is out of chances. Sage will probably be blacklisted and/or removed from AMO now.

Does "Sandbox" just mean the user has to check the box "Let me install this experimental add-on"? If so, I don't think that is sufficient. The user is not warned about the widely publicized vulnerability.

The sandboxing of Sage is only the first step. Next up will be removing Sage from AMO and/or adding all vulnerable versions of Sage to the add-on blocklist.

Though if it gets to the point Mozilla adds Sage to the blocklist, that will solve your problem of people not being warned about Sage as if somebody tries downloading Sage after it's added to the blocklist, Firefox will warn people if they try to/do install an unsecured version of Sage.

Though this blocklist won't stop any future versions of Sage if by chance the author of Sage issues new updates (especially to fix the security problems) or somebody else out there on the net forks Sage and fixes the problems with it.

Can you point me to where these bug fix suggestions exist? My google searches aren't coming up with anything. Thanks.

If there were suggestions, I'd imagine they were sent through e-mail, IM, or through the security sensitive bug(s) filed at Mozilla's Bugzilla itself.

So your request is impossible to fulfill unless by chance Mozilla removes the security sensitive flag(s) from the bug(s) affecting Sage that were filed at Mozilla's Bugzilla.

I know I'm double posting, but Sage apparently has a new host now. -> sagerss.com

There are no new updates there though. The last update is still listed from 2008, so don't download anything from that site until the author updates Sage that fixes the vulnerability problems. (This is why I didn't make sagerss.com an actual link.)

Sage 1.4.4 was released yesterday. The site says "This is a maintenance release to address a security issue." However, <https://www.mozdev.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20610> is still not fixed. He says a 3.6 compatible version will be available soon. Maybe the fix will be in there.

This is really an annoying thing, since Sage does just what I wanted, and didn't try to do anything extra.

It also explains what happened a couple of months ago when I clicked on one of my feeds and suddenly I had a Trojan trying to install itself.

I really hope that the creator decides to really fix the security issue, 'cause it really was a good (for the most part) extension.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : firefox-sage
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2009-4102
Debian Bug     : 559267

It was discovered that firefox-sage, a lightweight RSS and Atom feed
reader for Firefox, does not sanitise the RSS feed information
correctly, which makes it prone to a cross-site scripting and a
cross-domain scripting attack.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2-0.1+lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.6-4etch1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.3-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-sage packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
