  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2009-4138",
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the firewire-ohci driver used for OHCI compliant IEEE 1394 controllers. A local, unprivileged user with access to /dev/fw* files could issue certain IOCTL calls, causing a denial of service or privilege escalation. The FireWire modules are blacklisted by default, and if enabled, only root has access to the files noted above by default.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check in the firewire-ohci driver when handling receive packets with a data length of zero. Specifically, the driver doesn't properly handle a specific ioctl call with zero length packets, leading to a null pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Improper handling of zero-length packets",
      "Missing input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged user can cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially achieve privilege escalation. The specific impact depends on whether the ohci controller is of version 1.0 or 1.1 (emulating ohci 1.0).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the `/dev/fw*` files",
      "Issuing a specific IOCTL call with zero length packets"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to /dev/fw* device files. Although the FireWire modules are blacklisted by default and if enabled, only root has access to the files, a user with permissions to open those files can exploit this vulnerability.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability impacts ohci 1.0 controllers or ohci 1.1 controllers used in ohci 1.0 mode due to hardware bugs. In the case of ohci 1.1 controllers running in 1.1 mode, the same call doesn't result in a crash. The vulnerability is located in the drivers/firewire/ohci.c file within the Linux kernel."
