Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4264:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw.
*   The `language_path` parameter in the `connect.php` script is not properly sanitized.
*   The `include_once()` function uses the attacker-controlled `language_path` parameter, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include files from a remote server, effectively executing malicious code on the server.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to validate or sanitize the `language_path` parameter, which enables the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a malicious PHP file hosted on an attacker's server, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `connect.php` script.
*   The attacker manipulates the `language_path` parameter to specify a malicious remote file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must know that the `language_path` parameter in `connect.php` is vulnerable.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs a publicly accessible server to host the malicious PHP file to be included.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in AROUNDMe 1.1.
*   The vulnerable file is `aroundme/components/core/connect.php`.
*   The vulnerable line is `include_once($language_path . 'connect.lang.php');`
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) is provided demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability: `http://server/[path]/components/core/connect.php?language_path=[Shell]`
