Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `pdf_shade4.c` file of the MuPDF library. This vulnerability arises from improper handling of the `/Decode` arrays within shading types 4 to 7 in PDF documents. Specifically, the code iterates through the `/Decode` array, extracting floating-point values without properly checking the size of the array against the fixed-size buffers allocated on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The core vulnerability is the ability to write beyond the bounds of stack-allocated buffers `c0` and `c1` in the `pdf_loadtype4shade`, `pdf_loadtype5shade`, `pdf_loadtype6shade` and `pdf_loadtype7shade` functions.
*   **Lack of bounds checking:** The code does not validate that the length of the `/Decode` array is within acceptable limits before copying data into the `c0` and `c1` arrays.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** A successful exploit could overwrite critical data on the stack, including the return address, allowing an attacker to hijack the program's execution flow and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Crash:** If the overwritten data does not lead to controllable execution, the application is likely to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF Documents:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious PDF file that contains an overly large `/Decode` array within a type 4 to 7 shading dictionary.
*   **File Parsing:** When the vulnerable MuPDF library parses the malicious PDF, the oversized `/Decode` array will trigger the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft a PDF document:** The attacker must be able to create a PDF document with a specially crafted shading dictionary with an oversized `/Decode` array.
*   **Targeted User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to get the victim to open the malicious PDF document using a vulnerable version of MuPDF or an application that relies on MuPDF (like SumatraPDF)

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `pdf_loadtype4shade`, `pdf_loadtype5shade`, `pdf_loadtype6shade` and `pdf_loadtype7shade` functions, which handle different types of PDF shadings.
*   The code copies floating-point values from the `/Decode` array into two local `float` arrays, `c0` and `c1`  without proper size validation, where these arrays are defined as `float c0[FZ_MAXCOLORS]` and `float c1[FZ_MAXCOLORS]`.
*   The `FZ_MAXCOLORS` constant defines the maximum size of these arrays, and overflowing them can cause a stack corruption.
*   The exploit requires crafting a PDF with a `/Decode` array that has more elements than `FZ_MAXCOLORS` would allow.
*   The exploit needs to convert hexadecimal values into floating point representation because the `fz_toreal` function is used to read array values.
*   Care must be taken to avoid overwriting the stack location of the `obj` pointer as this can cause a crash.
*  The vulnerability was present in MuPDF before commit `20091125231942`, and was fixed by commits `a21cc1548993c392e474817bb3d656eb3730d88f` and `cf6860c3d70a2f7a63cdb621cc3b58c891915deb`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit-db entry notes that visual studio failed to flag this vulnerability despite the presence of the `/GS` flag.
*   The advisory mentions that DEP and ASLR were enabled in SumatraPDF to protect against exploitation.
*   A ruby script was provided that can generate a PDF that triggers a crash.

The provided information gives a good understanding of the root cause and exploitation of this buffer overflow vulnerability.
