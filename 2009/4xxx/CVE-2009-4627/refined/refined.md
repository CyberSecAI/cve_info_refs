{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application constructs a file path by concatenating a base directory, a template name, and a user-supplied filename (`p_filename`) without sufficient sanitization, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem by manipulating the `p_filename` parameter to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`).",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "network": "HTTP request",
      "input": "The `p_filename` parameter in the URL"
    },
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is located in the `sources/_template_parser.php` file. The file attempts to open a file based on a user-supplied parameter named 'p_filename'. If the initial file open fails, it attempts to open a file in the 'MoaDefault' template directory. This second attempt is still vulnerable to path traversal if the provided filename contains the appropriate sequences."
