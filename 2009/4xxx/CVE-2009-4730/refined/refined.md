Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-4730:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The x10 Media Adult Script 1.7 suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization and validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The `report.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection. This is due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the `id` parameter. The attacker can inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the database.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The `report.php` script is also vulnerable to blind SQL injection, indicating that the results of the injected SQL queries are not directly displayed, but attackers can infer results based on application behavior or timing differences.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple scripts are vulnerable to XSS, specifically:
        *   `includes/video_ad.php` via the `pic_id` parameter.
        *   `linkvideos_listing.php` via the `category` parameter.
        *   `templates/header1.php` via the `id` parameter.
        *    `video_listing.php` via the `category` and `key` parameters.
        These vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts that are executed in the context of the user's browser.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially:
        *   Gain unauthorized access to sensitive database information, including user credentials, personal data, and application-specific data.
        *   Modify or delete data within the database.
        *   Potentially gain control over the server through database vulnerabilities.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** While slower to exploit, it allows the attacker to extract sensitive data by observing the application's behavior
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can:
        *   Steal user session cookies, allowing account hijacking.
        *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
        *   Deface the website by injecting arbitrary HTML content.
        *   Perform actions on behalf of the user, exploiting the user's privileges.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `id` parameter in the `report.php` script.
    *  **Blind SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `id` parameter in the `report.php` script, inferring results based on application behavior.
    *   **XSS:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code in the `pic_id`, `category`, or `key` parameters of the vulnerable scripts.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   The attacker does not require any special privileges or insider access to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    *   The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept exploit URLs, which confirm the vulnerabilities' existence.
*   The identified vulnerabilities are in a PHP-based web application, specifically x10 Media Adult Script 1.7.
*   This information is more detailed than a simple CVE description, offering specifics on vulnerable parameters and scripts.
