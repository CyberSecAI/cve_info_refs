{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Xerver HTTP Server's web-based configuration program allows modification of the server's port setting. Setting the port to a non-numeric value (e.g., letters) causes the server to crash.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application does not validate the input provided for the server port, allowing an attacker to enter a non-numeric value which leads to a denial of service. The web-based configuration panel lacks authentication.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The server crashes and cannot be restarted without manually editing the configuration file to correct the port value.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed remotely through the web-based configuration program, accessible via port 32123, by submitting a form with an invalid port value.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server's port 32123 to access the web-based configuration program. No authentication is needed to make changes."
