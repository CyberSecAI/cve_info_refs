Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of vulnerabilities in Diskos CMS Manager. This includes SQL injection, an authentication bypass, and database disclosure vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `kat` parameter in the `side.asp` page. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries used by the application.
2.  **Authentication Bypass:** There is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the login mechanism. By using the credentials `' or '1=1` for both username and password, an attacker can gain administrative access.
3. **Database Disclosure**: The application reveals the path to the database files, such as `log.mdb`, `artikler_prod.mdb`, and `medlemmer.mdb`, allowing potential download and extraction of sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could extract sensitive data from the database. The provided example demonstrates how to extract user IDs and passwords.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker could gain full administrative control over the CMS, potentially allowing complete site takeover.
*  **Database Disclosure**: Attackers can potentially access and download sensitive data, including user information and other site data, stored in the database files.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting a malicious URL with a manipulated `kat` parameter in `side.asp`.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By using specific crafted inputs (`' or '1=1`) in the login form.
*  **Database Disclosure:** Direct access to database files via URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   No special privileges are needed initially, as the vulnerabilities are accessible over the web.

**Additional Details:**
* The exploit-db entry provides specific URLs for exploitation, including SQL injection queries and database file locations.
