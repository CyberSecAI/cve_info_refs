# *********************************************************************************************************
# I really _hate_ releasing proof of concepts. ASCII gets itchy after a few months. And it has been over a
# year since a WS_FTP exploit/PoC has been on milw0rm (as far as I know) (!). Crazy right? This bug was
# found with Hzzp, yes WS_FTP parses HTTP too. Format string in the status code, bang bang. But the problem
# is we can't seem to be able to use %n, which I believe is disabled by default per Microsoft, making
# exploitation more difficult. Hrm. And where is a security contact for Ipswitch? I believe I did try to
# find a reasonable resource. Maybe Ipswitch should just fuzz their products with Hzzp? xD Happy Holidays!

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Release Notes for WS\_FTP Professional 12.2 and WS\_FTP Home 12.2

In this File

# 12.2 Release Notes

## About this document

This document contains information on how to install and configure WS\_FTP Professional, and WS\_FTP Home. Depending on which WS\_FTP client product you have purchased, portions of this document may not apply.

## New Features in WS\_FTP 12.2

* **New Icons**: The icons in the application have been modernized with cleaner, higher-color versions. Try running your toolbars in ****Large Icon**** mode to really see the difference!
* **Cleaner Navigation**: Several duplicate entries have been removed from the menu and toolbars and several commonly used options have been promoted. See the detailed list of menu and button changes in the section below.
* **Windows 7 Support**: This release has been qualified against Microsoft's "Windows 7 Cookbook" and includes both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows 7 support.
* **Better Vista Support**: This release resolves all remaining issues with UAC in Microsoft Vista.
* **Configurable SMTP ports/timeouts**: In Program Options: Email Notifications, you can now set the SMTP port to something other than the default port, and you can set the time that the SMTP connection remains open.
* **SSL session reuse**: In Site Options: SSL, you select to Reuse SSL Session. When making a second connection to the same server, this will use the existing SSL session (rather than creating a new SSL session). This provides an immediate connection without requiring a second login.
* Several dozen **defect fixes**.

### Menu and Button Changes in WS\_FTP 12.2

* Renamed the ****File**** main menu to the ****Connections**** menu.
* Removed the entire ****Edit**** menu. (The ****Copy/Paste**** functions found on this menu are also available as right-click options in file panels.)
* The ****Connection Wizard**** button and menu item have been folded into the main ****Connect**** button.
* The ****QuickConnect**** (Toolbar) button and menu item have been replaced with full-blown toolbar support for the ****QuickConnect**** toolbar, accessible and configurable in the same manner that other toolbars were previously.
* The ****New Backup Job**** and ****Manage Backup Jobs**** buttons have been consolidated into a single ****Backup Files**** button – this matches today's menu tree item.
* Similarly, the two synchronization buttons have been consolidated into a single ****Sync Files**** button that matches today's menu tree item.
* Removed ****MenuBar**** as a visible type of toolbar.
* Added a new ****Connections | Sites**** menu tree.
* Removed ****Properties**** from the ****File**** menu (also available as right-click options in file panels).
* Removed ****Refresh****, file list options (e.g., ****Large Icons****) and ****Arrange Icons by**** from the View menu (these items were duplicates of the same items found in the context of the file panes).
* Removed ****Site Manager**** and ****Add to Site Manager**** items from the ****Tools**** menu (these items are duplicates of ****Connect**** items or in-context right-click items).
* On the ****Tools** **> **Operations After Transfer****** menu, renamed ****Exit Application**** menu item to ****Exit WS\_FTP****
* Added or removed ellipses ("�") from several entries to clarify ellipses, which mean that you will be prompted for more information. (For example, we removed this from ****About**** but added to ****Options****).

## Version 12.0.1 Patch Release

We released a patch version (12.0.1) in May 2009 to fix some customer reported issues with the 12 release. The patch is a full version of the software, and should be installed over the 12 installation.

This patch addresses the following issues:

* For customers with very large (Microsoft) networks, more than 1,000 nodes that show up via NetBIOS, WS\_FTP Professional 12 hangs while launching, transferring files, or exiting the application.

  Although the network discovery thread runs in background, the bookkeeping for the GUI local pane grew exponentially with the size of the network.

  This patch includes a fix to limit the number of computers in the Network scan to 500, by default. The value can also be set in the wsftp\_options.ini: under General, add a new key "MaxNetworkScan=<number of computers to scan for>" If the number is 0, scanning is disabled. Otherwise, the scan proceeds to the specified number and then shuts itself off.
* Some customers were unable to launch WS\_FTP Professional 12 after upgrading from WS\_FTP Professional 2007.1. This patch fixes the defect that caused initialization of some GUI utilities to fail in certain customer environments.
* Fixes a defect that caused SSH/SFTP downloads from some servers to result in an incomplete file.
* Fixes a defect that caused HTTP transfers to MOVEit DMZ to fail when MOVEit DMZ is installed in a virtual directory.

## New features in WS\_FTP 12

Security

* **Built-in local file encryption using OpenPGP**: OpenPGP encryption secures files and folders locally. (WS\_FTP Professional)
* **FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography**: Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) validated cryptography up to 256-bit AES encryption over SSL/SSH protocols and OpenPGP file encryption. (WS\_FTP Professional)
* **Non-repudiation and compression with MOVEit DMZ server**: Built-in automatic end-to-end file non-repudiation and compression between WS\_FTP Professional and MOVEit DMZ Server. (WS\_FTP Professional)
* **SSH key management and enhanced SSH capabilities**: SSH user keys can be imported and exported to and from Windows, Unix, and Linux systems. (WS\_FTP Professional)
* **Enhanced SSL certificate management**: Import full Certificate Authority from PKCS#12 formatted certificates into the Trusted Authority database.

Productivity and Performance

* **Improved performance**: Quicker display and faster navigation through large directory trees, and when opening/closing the application.
* **Post transfer file automation**: New file workflow capabilities let users schedule a post transfer action, such as deleting, renaming, or moving the source file after it has been transferred. (WS\_FTP Professional)
* **Support for Microsoft IIS and Apache web servers**: Connect to and transfer files over HTTP/S connections with Microsoft IIS and Apache web servers with full file/folder listings and navigation.
* **Windows 2008 support**: WS\_FTP Professional now runs on Microsoft Windows 2008, as well as Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows XP.
* **Licensing**: Activation status and serial number are now displayed in the user interface (****Help** **> **About******).

## System requirements

### Supported operating systems

WS\_FTP supports the following Operating Systems:

* Microsoft Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit English and German editions)
* Microsoft Windows Vista (32-bit English and German editions); Service Pack 2 (SP2) recommended
* Microsoft Windows XP Professional (32-bit English and German editions); Service Pack 3 (SP3) recommended
* Microsoft Windows 2008 Standard (32-bit English edition); Service Pack (SP2) recommended
* Microsoft Windows 2003 Standard (32-bit English edition); Service Pack (SP2) recommended

### Hardware requirements

Minimum requirements based on Windows XP Professional, SP3:

* 233 megahertz (MHz) processor
* 64 megabytes (MB) of memory
* 2 gigabytes (GB) hard drive and 50 MB free disk space during installation

## Installing WS\_FTP

If you purchased a WS\_FTP CD-ROM, insert the CD in a drive. If the CD does not automatically display a "Welcome" screen, click the Windows **Start** button and select **Run**. Enter the CD-ROM drive letter followed by autorun.exe. For example, *D:\autorun.exe*. Follow the instructions on your screen.

If you downloaded the WS\_FTP installation executable, double-click the downloaded file to start the installation. Follow the instructions on your screen.

### Activating (All applications)

There are four ways you can make a WS\_FTP installation active:

* If you installed WS\_FTP using an installation application downloaded from a link in a purchase confirmation email, then the program will be fully functional immediately after installation. No further action will need to be taken.
* If you downloaded the installation application from another source, when you run the installation, it will automatically ask you for your license serial number and attempt to activate.
* If the WS\_FTP license is not activated during installation, or if you are upgrading from a previous WS\_FTP version, you can manually activate WS\_FTP (see below).
* If for some reason you cannot activate your license via Internet connection, you can opt for an offline activation. To force offline activation, on the Activation screen, clear the check mark for ****Use active Internet connection****. You will then need to go to www.myipswitch.com, click on ****Offline Activation****, and follow the instructions displayed.

To manually activate the license on an existing installation:

**Note**: Before you start the manual activation process, make sure that you have your product serial number, MyIpswitch account name, and password available for use during activation.

* Click ****Start** **> **Programs > Ipswitch WS\_FTP > Activate or Refresh WS\_FTP License******.

- or -

* If you run the WS\_FTP installation, near the end, it will display a License dialog. Enter your serial number and click ****Activate**** to start the license activation process.

Follow the on-screen instructions, entering your product serial number, MyIpswitch account name, and password.

**Note**: When the activation is complete, a confirmation page indicates the license has been activated. If the activation does not complete successfully, you may be behind a proxy or firewall that is blocking the activation request. In this case, click the Offline button, then follow the onscreen instructions.

For more help and information about licensing, go to the MyIpswitch (www.myipswitch.com) licensing portal.

For information about unattended, or "silent" installations, see the WS\_FTP Release Notes.

### Uninstalling (All Applications)

The uninstall function removes all files associated with WS\_FTP from your computer, including your configured sites. It also removes the WS\_FTP icon from your desktop. To uninstall WS\_FTP, you need to use the "Add/Remove Programs" function located in the Control Panel. Select WS\_FTP Professional 12 (or WS\_FTP Home 12) from the program list and click the "Change/Remove" button.

## Silent Install (All Applications)

WS\_FTP install allows for a "silent" (unattended) product install. In the present WS\_FTP version, you can use silent install to automate installations for local computers only.

Silent install requires two operations. The first operation "records" the options that you choose during a normal install, storing them in a local "response" file. The second automatically runs an install on a different computer, based on the options recorded in the file created in the first operation.

This means that if other computers require identical install options to the ones you recorded in a response file, you can use that file to automate installation on those computers. A simple command will automatically perform the installation using the entries recorded in response file. Other than the execution of the command, the install will require no input from the user.

**Note**: If the respective computers do *not* have the same install option requirements, and you nonetheless run the silent install using the same file, an error may result and the install will fail.

You can also run a silent *uninstall.* You can do this by initiating a record operation, recording an *un*install,and then performing a silent install process described below, using the response file you created during the *un*install process.

To perform a silent install (or uninstall):

1. Initiate the recording to start the response file:

   Execute the following at a command line or Run dialog:

    `[path+executable].exe -r -f1[path]\setup.iss SERIAL="[serial number + UAP]"`

   where *[path+executable]* is the name of the WS\_FTP install executable you are creating the response file for, plus its location

   ...the second *[path]* is the location where you wish to create the response file

   ...setup.iss is the response file itself (you can name the file a different name if you wish). There should be no space between the option "f1" and the path for the setup.iss file

   **Note**:The "SERIAL=" argument is optional depending on whether your install executable has an embedded serial number, and whether the install machine has Internet connectivity, as described the next section.

   *...[serial number + UAP]* is your assigned serial number + the UAP, which is a security code that you append to the serial number to activate the license. You can find the product name plus the assigned serial number in the My Licenses tab on MyIpswitch.com. A license`s UAP is exposed to users under "Additional License Information." The UAP is displayed only when you are authorized to activate the license on more than one system.

   For example, using all arguments, the command would look like:

    `[c:\downloads\wsftp_install.exe].exe -r -f1c:\silentinstall\setup.iss SERIAL="1X4CF7M10W33XS1OVCCW2ST"`
2. Proceed with the install using the options you wish to record. When you click Finish, the install (or uninstall) recording will be complete.

3. Execute the silent install on the desired computer by running the following:

 `[path+executable].exe -s -f1[path]\setup.iss SERIAL="[serial number + UAP]"`

where the bracketed values are the same ones mentioned in the previous step. (Again, there should be no space between the option "f1" and the path for the setup.iss file.)

...again, the "SERIAL=" argument is optional depending on whether your install executable has an embedded serial number, and whether the install machine has Internet connectivity, as described in the next section.

For example, using all arguments, the command would look like:

 `[c:\downloads\wsftp_install.exe].exe -s -f1c:\silentinstall\setup.iss SERIAL="1X4CF7M10W33XS1OVCCW2ST"`

After this step, the silent install will proceed with no further input needed.

You can run each of these operations with no specifics after the command. This will perform the operation with default values. The default for the record operation will store the file as "setup.iss" in the system's Windows folder. The execute silent install operation will lookfor a file of that name in the same folder. If there is no .iss file present, the install will fail.

### More on Serial Numbers

You may need to use the SERIAL argument to this command to specify your serial number and to activate your software. Activation of the silent install depends on two factors: whether your install executable has an embedded serial number, and whether the install machine has Internet connectivity. There are four scenarios:

### You have a downloaded WS\_FTP install executable, which has an embedded serial number and the install machine has Internet connectivity. In this case:

1. Run the command without the SERIAL argument. Activation will occur silently.
2. Run the recorded file without the SERIAL argument. Activation will occur silently.

   Result: You can run the recorded install up to your maximum permissible license activations.

### You have a downloaded WS\_FTP install executable, which has an embedded serial number and the install machine **does not** have Internet connectivity. In this case:

1. Rename the install executable so that the file name does not include the serial number and UAP.
2. Run the record command without the SERIAL argument. While recording, when the Activation dialog opens, click Cancel to close the dialog and return to the install wizard. Complete the installation.
3. Run the recorded file without the SERIAL argument.

   Result: The WS\_FTP is installed, but does not have a license file.
4. Contact customer service to arrange a license with multiple activations or use offline activation to activate each installation. For offline activation, go to [www.myipswitch.com](http://www.myipswitch.com), click on ****Offline Activation****, and follow the instructions displayed.

### You have a downloaded WS\_FTP install executable, and a separate NSA license file, and the install machine **does not** have Internet connectivity. In this case:

1. Rename the install executable so that the file name does not include the serial number and UAP.
2. Run the record command without the SERIAL argument. There will not be an activation, as you are using the NSA license. Complete the installation.
3. Run the recorded file without the SERIAL argument.

   Result: The WS\_FTP is installed, but does not have a license file.
4. Place the license file, named "license.txt" into the the appropriate folder, depending on which version of WS\_FTP you are installing:
   * WS\_FTP Professional 12.2 and WS\_FTP Home 12.2 version 12.0: \Program Files\Ipswitch\WS\_FTP 12\
   * WS\_FTP Professional 12.2 and WS\_FTP Home 12.2 version 12.2: \Documents and Settings\All Users\Ipswitch\WS\_FTP\

### You have a CD with the WS\_FTP install executable and the install machine has Internet connectivity. In this case:

1. Run the record command with the SERIAL argument. Activation will occur silently.
2. Run the recorded file with the SERIAL argument. Activation will occur silently.

   Result: You can run the recorded install up to your maximum permissible license activations.

### You have a CD with the WS\_FTP install executable and the install machine **does not** have Internet connectivity. In this case:

1. Run the record command without the SERIAL argument. Activation will occur silently.
2. Run the recorded file without the SERIAL argument.

   Result: The WS\_FTP is installed, but does not have a license file.
3. Contact customer service to arrange a license with multiple activations or use offline activation to activate each installation. For offline activation, go to [www.myipswitch.com](http://www.myipswitch.com), click on ****Offline Activation****, and follow the instructions displayed.

### Setup.log

The install creates a log file in the same directory as the response file: setup.log. The Setup.log file contains three sections. The first section,[InstallShield Silent], identifies the version of InstallShield Silent used in the silent setup. The second section, [Application], identifies the installed application's name and version, and the company name. The third section, [ResponseResult], contains the result code indicating whether or not the silent setup succeeded.

The ResponseResult should show one of two values. If your install failed due to a missing value, you will see a value of "-3" in the log file. This means there was a mismatch between 1) the install requirements of the computer originally used to generate the response file, and 2) the install requirements of the target computer.

For instance, if setup.iss contains setup instructions for an Express install on a fresh machine, but the target computer contains a PostgreSQL database, then the silent install will fail, because the install steps for computers with pre-existing PostgreSQL databases are different from computers without them.

A ResponseResult of "0" indicates a successful install.

For further information useful in troubleshooting an install, you can also refer to the `WS_FTP_Install.LOG,` which the install writes to the `C:\Windows\System32\` folder.

### The SUPPRESSREBOOT option

Some installs will require a reboot, especially installs on computers that have never had a WS\_FTP installation. If you do not want the target computer to reboot, enter the command "SUPPRESSREBOOT" at the end of the command line. For instance:

 `[path+executable].exe -s -f1[path]\setup.iss SUPPRESSREBOOT`

You may need to edit the setup.iss file.

If the setup.iss contains a line with the ending `SdFinishReboot-0`, you will need to replace it with `SdFinish-0.` For instance, you should replace the line--

 `Dlg##={3F464442-A51F-414B-ACA4-78BCF276B346}-SdFinishReboot-0`

...with the line:

 `Dlg##={3F464442-A51F-414B-ACA4-78BCF276B346}-SdFinish-0`

...where "##" represents the install dialog screen number that the line describes.

Similarly, the lines--

 `[{3F464442-A51F-414B-ACA4-78BCF276B346}-SdFinishReboot-0]`
 `Result=6`
 `BootOption=3`

...should be changed to:

 `[{3F464442-A51F-414B-ACA4-78BCF276B346}-SdFinish-0]`
 `Result=1`
 `bOpt1=0`
 `bOpt2=0`

If a reboot was required by the installation, you will still need to perform a reboot for the application to work as expected.

## Terminal services support

If you use WS\_FTP via terminal services, such as Microsoft Terminal Services or Citrix, see the setup information in our Knowledge Base article on [terminal services](http://support.ipswitch.com/kb/WS-20071128-MB01.htm).

## Fixed in 12.2

* HTTP/S security vulnerability fixed: Thank-you to Jeremy Brown for working with our security team on this vulnerability. (Note to other researchers: a message to security@ipswitch.com will always be received.)

  This release fixes a "format string" defect that affects HTTP/S hosts - FTP/FTPS/SFTP hosts are not affected. To invoke this vulnerability, a victim must be enticed to connect to a rogue HTTP/S site using WS\_FTP Professional v12 or WS\_FTP Home v12. This defect is fixed in the 12.2 versions of the products, and also available separately in a patch for the v12 version.
* Fixed a defect that prevented WS\_FTP from launching when installed on Windows Vista, with the User Account Control (UAC) enabled. The UAC issues have been addressed, so it is no longer necessary to disable the UAC.
* Fixed a defect that caused Email notification to work only on servers that accept the "HELO" command. Email notification now also works with mail servers that receive EHLO commands.
* Backup wizard (Backup Locations screen) ... If you use the ZIP files before backing up option, to include the current date/time in the name of the destination zip file, include the string "%date" in the file name you enter. WS\_FTP will replace that string with the current date/time in format: yyyymmdd-hhmmss
* Fixed a defect with the ****Reuse SSL Session**** option (****Site Options** **> **SSL******). When making a second connection to the same server, use the existing SSL session (rather than creating a new SSL session). This provides an immediate connection without requiring a second login.
* Fixed a defect that caused the SSL.log file to fill with errors and grow to a large size.
* In many of the prompts in v12, such as New Folder and Change Folder, the cursor was not placed in the text box. This release fixes the problem.
* Fixed a defect that caused command line transfers to return an incorrect error code when the file was not found.
* The Thumbnail view for the file lists were not centered (in V12), which caused the view to be clipped. This release fixes the problem.
* When using a UNC path, the file list view did not refresh when a file was transferred to the UNC. This release fixes the problem.
* When doing a silent install, the "- f" in the silent install command should be "-f" with no space between the characters. The documentation includes this correction.

## Known issues

This section documents known issues, and any available means to work around the issue.

* E-Mail Notifications (****Options** **> **E-Mail Notifications******)

  When transferring files using the command line utility directly, or using the command line with the Scheduler Utility, the Download failure notification does not work if the file to be downloaded is not found. The workaround is to use the Script Utility to process the download, as the Script Utility will send the Download failure notification when the file is not found.
* Command line compress option cannot be used with post transfer actions

  When using the command line, the -compress option overrides post transfer actions. Post transfer actions will not be run if the compress option is also specified.
