Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4775:

**Verification:**
The provided content from exploit-db.com directly references CVE-2009-4775. Additionally, the release notes from Ipswitch mentions a fix for a "format string" vulnerability reported by Jeremy Brown, which is the same author listed in the exploit-db entry. This confirms the content relates to the specified CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a format string vulnerability in the HTTP/S handling within Ipswitch WS_FTP Professional 12.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The software improperly handles format specifiers in the HTTP status code, allowing for arbitrary data injection.  The provided exploit uses `%s%s` as a payload to trigger the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The exploit-db entry classifies the exploit type as "dos", suggesting a denial-of-service attack is the likely outcome. The inability to use `%n` limits the exploit's impact, preventing arbitrary code execution, but it still causes instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** A malicious server hosting an HTTP/S service can send a crafted status code that triggers the vulnerability when a client connects with WS_FTP.
- The attacker does not need to directly access the victim machine, but does need to make the WS_FTP client connect to their malicious server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set up an HTTP/S server.
- They need to lure a user to connect to that malicious server with WS_FTP.
- No advanced privilege escalation is required, as the vulnerability is triggered by the client itself.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code shows a proof-of-concept (PoC) in Perl that sets up a simple server that sends the vulnerable payload.
- The release notes from Ipswitch confirm the vulnerability and its fix in version 12.2, noting that the vulnerability only affects the HTTP/S protocol.
- The notes indicate that the vulnerability can be triggered when a user is enticed to connect to a rogue HTTP/S site using WS_FTP Professional v12 or WS_FTP Home v12.

In summary, CVE-2009-4775 refers to a format string vulnerability in Ipswitch WS_FTP Professional 12 when handling HTTP/S responses. This vulnerability can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). The attacker needs to set up a malicious HTTP/S server and trick the WS_FTP client into connecting. This vulnerability was fixed in version 12.2.
