| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c0)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-14 20:59:42 UTC  ``` A bug report [1] for OpenSUSE indicates that lxsession-logout does not lock the screen before suspending, hibernating, or switching users.  A patch [2] was attached to the bug to correct the issue.  This issue would affect lxsession in Fedora.  [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=622083> [2] <https://bugzillafiles.novell.org/attachment.cgi?id=375737>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c1)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-14 21:00:49 UTC  ``` Created lxsession tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 614609](show_bug.cgi?id=614609 "CLOSED WONTFIX - lxsession: does not lock the screen before suspending/hibernating/switching users [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c2)  Christoph Wickert    2010-07-14 22:40:45 UTC  ``` I'm in contact with the SUSE maintainer already but I will not apply the patch if the SUSE people don't upstream it properly. I think blindly copying patches that are not upstreamed is against our policies, see <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Staying_close_to_upstream_projects>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c3)  Christoph Wickert    2010-07-14 22:42:20 UTC  ``` P.S.: I don't consider this a vulnerability only because a person at SUSE does and I think that our security response shouldn't do ether.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c4)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-15 05:06:58 UTC  ``` I didn't file the bug to necessarily force you to adopt SUSE's patch.  The patch was noted because it was noted in their bug (honestly, the bug would have been filed whether a patch existed or not).  I'm aware of the upstream policy and I don't know what SUSE has done to approach upstream regarding it.  The bug was filed to make the maintainer aware of the situation.  However, I'm not considering this a vulnerability because someone at SUSE thinks so.  I'm considering at a vulnerability because I'm of the frame of mind that if you are hibernating or suspending your system, it is reasonable to expect to be prompted for a password when you return to it.  Is that an unreasonable expectation?  Or do you have a different argument for why you don't think this is a security issue, aside from the fact that someone at SUSE does?  (I also use the term "security issue" a little loosely here... it's more of a privacy issue since it is something you need to get your hands on physically, but if nothing else I would certainly consider this a bug and worth investigating and dealing with upstream on, whether that is via SUSE or directly).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c5)  Christoph Wickert    2010-07-15 10:55:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c4)) > I don't know what SUSE has done to approach upstream regarding it.

What makes you think so? Only because it is that way in GNOME?  > Is that an unreasonable expectation?

I'm NOT saying it is a privacy issue BECAUSE someone at SUSE thinks so, I'm saying if it is an issue, it is because of false assumptions. IMHO locking the display and suspenmding/hibernating a machine are 2 different things. If somebody has physical access to a machine, you will be in trouble anyway.  Note that we have the same in Xfce and upstream made it very clear that he has no intentions to change that behavior, see [bug 587633 comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=587633#c3 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Screen not always locked after resume from hibernate").  Anyway, waiting for SUSE to file a bug and a reaction from upstream.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c6)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-15 15:27:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c5)) > (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c4)) > > I don't know what SUSE has done to approach upstream regarding it. >  > I'm trying to figure that out.

Only because it is that way in GNOME?  Not just GNOME, but most operating systems IIRC.  Not sure about Windows, but OS X does this, and I suspect KDE does this as well.   > > Is that an unreasonable expectation?

IMHO locking the > display and suspenmding/hibernating a machine are 2 different things. If > somebody has physical access to a machine, you will be in trouble anyway.  I don't think it's necessarily a false assumption, just a reasonable one.  Of course you're in trouble if someone has physical access to a machine.  But again, this is more of a privacy thing than a security thing.   > Note that we have the same in Xfce and upstream made it very clear that he has > no intentions to change that behavior, see [bug 587633 comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=587633#c3 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Screen not always locked after resume from hibernate").  That's fine; upstream XFCE is certainly entitled to their opinion on their own sofware.  This bug has nothing to do with XFCE.  Using the same argument, I can say that we _do_ have this support in GNOME.   > Anyway, waiting for SUSE to file a bug and a reaction from upstream.      Thank you.  If nothing else, and upstream indicates this is expected/normal/desired behaviour, we have something to point to that indicates this is not a bug or deficiency of any kind.  Considering SUSE has requested a CVE for this issue, this bug would have been created anyway:  <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/3197>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c7)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-16 20:00:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been assigned the name [CVE-2010-2532](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2532).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c8)  Christoph Wickert    2010-07-16 22:16:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c6))  > I don't think it's necessarily a false assumption, just a reasonable one.  Honestly, I wouldn't expect it. It's reasonable because it's based on expectations which in turn are based on other operating systems or desktop environments. If we followed that logik, we could file plenty of bugs.  > Of course you're in trouble if someone has physical access to a machine.  But > again, this is more of a privacy thing than a security thing.  Right, it's a privacy issue, not a security issue. Therefor it was wrong IMHO to request a CVE because it is not a vulnerability in the code.  > That's fine; upstream XFCE is certainly entitled to their opinion on their own > sofware.  This bug has nothing to do with XFCE.  Using the same argument, I can > say that we _do_ have this support in GNOME.  On the one hand Xfce is entitled to their opinion, but on the other hand LXDE is not and needs to do what the SUSE security team decides behind their backs?  I'm having serious problems with both the SUSE approach and their patch (as outlined in <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=622083#c7>)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c9)  Vincent Danen    2010-07-16 22:49:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c8)) > > I don't think it's necessarily a false assumption, just a reasonable one. >  > Honestly, I wouldn't expect it. It's reasonable because it's based on > expectations which in turn are based on other operating systems or desktop > environments. If we followed that logik, we could file plenty of bugs.  I'm not going to argue this.   > > Of course you're in trouble if someone has physical access to a machine.

Therefor it was wrong IMHO > to request a CVE because it is not a vulnerability in the code.  Yes, I said it was a privacy issue.  A CVE name was requested and assigned.  Not, I might add, by myself.  You can feel as strongly about this as you like, one way or the other, but it doesn't change the fact that SUSE requested a CVE, and it was given.  Now, if the LXDE upstream want to dispute this as being a concious design decision, then let's do that.  But complaining about a CVE being assigned isn't productive.  As an aside, it doesn't have to be a vulnerability in the code to obtain a CVE.. a deficient design or implementation (where the code is technically correct) is enough.   > > That's fine; upstream XFCE is certainly entitled to their opinion on their own > > sofware.  This bug has nothing to do with XFCE.  Using the same argument, I can > > say that we _do_ have this support in GNOME. >  > On the one hand Xfce is entitled to their opinion, but on the other hand LXDE > is not and needs to do what the SUSE security team decides behind their backs?  Who said that?   > I'm having serious problems with both the SUSE approach and their patch (as > outlined in <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=622083#c7>)      I would agree.  They should have taken this to upstream first.  Unfortunately, that did not happen and now we have an issue (whether it is a bug, security, privacy, whatever, is still up for debate) and a CVE name.  That is enough to create the bug to track it.  What happens after that doesn't negate the need for the bug.  Of course, arbitrarily dismissing this is just as arrogant as the SUSE approach, is it not?  Have you brought this up with upstream yet?  Or are you still relying on SUSE to do it (and do you expect them to do it properly, since you're having serious problems with their approach)?  Not that I blame you on that point.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c10)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-14 17:30:22 UTC  ``` This issue still seems to be unresolved, so I'm assuming it has not been fixed in Fedora at all as of yet:  <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3030798&group_id=180858&atid=894869>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c11)  Christoph Wickert    2011-06-14 20:38:01 UTC  ``` Don't forget to file a bug against GNOME 2 and 3, it doesn't lock the display either.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c12)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-17 22:57:32 UTC  ``` We're not talking about GNOME 2 and 3 here.  We're talking about this bug.  And _this_ issue is still unresolved, yes?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c13)  Christoph Wickert    2011-06-17 23:25:44 UTC  ``` We are talking about this "issue" and in order to determine if it is an *issue* at all, I suggested a look at other desktops handle this. Both Xfce and GNOME don't lock the screen either.  Since you are member of the security response team I'd expect you to 1. first of all do a risk evaluation 2. then talk to upstream 3. file bugs upstream if necessary 4. file bugs for the packages in question and add a reference to the upstream bug reports.  If you are really concerned about security, you should file bugs for the other components as well. If you are just trying to get good numbers for statistics, I can't help it.  Sorry if I sound rude here, but I will not maintain something that a fix is not upstreamed if it fixes an issue that IHMO is no issue.  I will be happy to issue an update as soon as there is a patch available that is a) upstreamed b) makes locking configurable.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c14)  Christoph Wickert    2011-06-18 11:53:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c13)) > Both Xfce and GNOME don't lock the screen either.  BTW: In GNOME 3 this is way more severe as suspend has replaced shutdown.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c15)  jurek.bajor    2011-07-13 06:59:32 UTC  ``` I think SUSE user made an unreasonable filing and request.  I do not think that this should be a permanent feature of LXDE experience. I agree with Christoph's opinions here that this is about *customization*.  There is a possible solution there: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=714413#c9](show_bug.cgi?id=714413#c9 "CLOSED WONTFIX - lxsession - conflicting autostart config files ?") with commentary.  JB   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=614608#c16)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-10 10:57:07 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=525395#c0)  Aleš Mareček    2009-09-24 08:22:51 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Suspend button in Action Buttons on xfce-panel just suspends computer but it doesn't lock the screen. So everybody is able to use your laptop without password needs after this suspend via "Action Buttons" - screen wasn't locked. If i close the cap of my laptop it will suspend and lock correctly (power manager is set for suspend after closing the cap).  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):   How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click to icon "Quit" (Action Buttons) 2. Click to suspend 3. Close and open cap of your laptop or use functional key for wake    Actual results: Suspend without locking screen  Expected results: Suspend and after waking your screen is locked  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=525395#c1)  Aleš Mareček    2009-09-24 08:24:00 UTC  ``` $ rpm -q xfce4-panel xfce4-panel-4.6.1-2.fc11.i586   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=525395#c2)  Christoph Wickert    2009-09-24 23:38:16 UTC  ``` The action buttons in xfce4-panel only have "Logout" and "Lock Screen". You are talking about the logout dialog, right?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=525395#c3)  Aleš Mareček    2009-09-25 09:35:23 UTC  ``` Probably yes. There are following buttons: "Log Out", "Restart", Shut Down", "Suspend" and "Hibernate" in this dialog.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=525395#c4)  Christoph Wickert    2009-09-25 09:44:08 UTC  ``` Ok, thanks for the clarification. I will look at this after the weekend.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=525395#c5)  Christoph Wickert    2009-10-04 09:28:59 UTC  ``` I took a look and it's way more complicated than I thought. Changes like this should be happening upstream, but the author of xfce4-session has no intentions to do so. Quote from <http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4805#c7>:  "I'm going to reject this.  xfce4-power-manager supports this already, and does a fine job.  It's silly to duplicate this in more than one place.  Conceptually, the session manager isn't the place for this anyway.  I'm planning on having xfce4-session's suspend/hibernate buttons (and possibly shutdown/reboot as well) send those actions to the power manager if present, so when that's done, the screen will lock appropriately."  Closing.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=525395#c6)  Christoph Wickert    2009-10-04 09:35:40 UTC  ``` Hope no one is disappointed now. Another quote, just to show how clear upstream is about this:  "My original assertion still stands: xfce4-session WILL NOT support locking the screen after suspend.  I've already explained why and I don't intend to rehash this."  <http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4805#c23>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=525395#c7)  Christoph Wickert    2010-04-30 14:52:03 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 587633](show_bug.cgi?id=587633 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Screen not always locked after resume from hibernate") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=632978#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-09-12 10:34:47 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2009-4996](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4996) to the following vulnerability:  ** DISPUTED **  Xfce4-session 4.5.91 in Xfce does not lock the screen when the suspend or hibernate button is pressed, which might make it easier for physically proximate attackers to access an unattended laptop via a resume action, a related issue to [CVE-2010-2532](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-2532). NOTE: there is no general agreement that this is a vulnerability, because separate control over locking can be an equally secure, or more secure, behavior in some threat environments.  References: [1] <http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4805> [2] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=525395](show_bug.cgi?id=525395 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Suspend button in logout dialog doesn't lock the screen") [3] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=587633](show_bug.cgi?id=587633 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Screen not always locked after resume from hibernate") [4] [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=614608](show_bug.cgi?id=614608 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2010-2532 lxsession: does not lock the screen before suspending/hibernating/switching users")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=632978#c1)  Christoph Wickert    2010-09-12 11:26:57 UTC  ``` Who requested this CVE? Has there been any attempt to contact upstream? If not, why doesn't RH Security response not do this?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=632978#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2010-09-12 11:51:04 UTC  ``` Hi Christoph,    this CVE was assigned recently by Mitre: [1] <http://cve.mitre.org/>  The very only purpose this Red Hat Bugzilla entry has been filed for is to track the particular CVE id for future purpose (for case some of the customers will ask for information regarding it) and perform its further research (to determine if the described behavior can impersonate a security threat).  It is possible after the research is complete, this bug will be closed (with appropriate resolution). But till that moment we need to track it and need a way how to reference it.  Hope this helps.  Thanks && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=632978#c3)  Christoph Wickert    2010-09-12 12:02:06 UTC  ``` Thanks for your reply, Jan.  (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=632978#c2)) >   this CVE was assigned recently by Mitre:  AFAIK there usually is somebody to *request* the CVE from Mitre before it gets actually assigned. I would have expected this person to contact upstream first (which I did in the meantime).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=632978#c4)  Christoph Wickert    2011-06-17 23:24:42 UTC  ``` Jan, can you tell me who actually requested the CVE?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=632978#c5)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-20 09:26:35 UTC  ``` Hi Christoph,    unfortunately I can't. We found out about this report from new [CVE-2009-4996](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4996) CVE identifier description from the Mitre CVE database, once it was assigned.  So I do not know on which basis this was assigned.  But when looking at the [CVE-2009-4996](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4996) references: [1] <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4996>  it looks the earliest entry, which (probably) went to CVE assignment is the upstream bug report: [2] <https://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4805>  But you can privately check with Steven Christey of Mitre to be definitely sure about the catalyst which went to the assignment.  Hope this helps. Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team  (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=632978#c4)) > Jan, can you tell me who actually requested the CVE?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=632978#c6)  hwj    2023-08-21 00:18:37 UTC  ``` A solution make be from this other related solution:  <https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon/issues/4324#issuecomment-1685426989>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=587633#c0)  cschwangler    2010-04-30 12:48:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 410395](attachment.cgi?id=410395 "Log files and other information") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=410395&action=edit "Log files and other information") Log files and other information  Description of problem: The screen is not locked after resuming from hibernation. This happens, if the hibernation time is below the time before the screen saver kicks in. For suspend everything works as expected, i.e. the screen is locked even if the time for the screen saver has not passed.  XFCE power manager is configured such that screen is to be locked after suspend/hibernate. My understanding (which may be wrong) is, that this means that the screen is always locked if the machine resumes from suspend/hibernate.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Fedora 13, nightly compose 2010-04-29, all updates applied, xfce-power-manager 0.8.5-1  How reproducible: Consistently on my machine.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Set screen saver to kick in after e.g. 15 minutes 2. Hibernate the machine 3. Resume after e.g. 5 minutes. Screen is not locked. 4. Resume after e.g. 20 minutes. Screen is locked.    Actual results: Screen is only locked, if time for screen saver has passed.  Expected results: If power manager is configured such that screen is locked after resume from suspend/hibernate, it should not depend on screen saver settings.  Additional info: Just want to make clear that there is no problem with going into suspend or hibernate mode, neither is there a problem with resuming on this machine.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=587633#c1)  Christoph Wickert    2010-04-30 14:00:27 UTC  ``` How so you hibernate the machine?

As already mentioned in [bug 525395](show_bug.cgi?id=525395 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Suspend button in logout dialog doesn't lock the screen"), upstream has no intentions to change the current behavior: "I'm going to reject this.  xfce4-power-manager supports this already, and does a fine job.  It's silly to duplicate this in more than one place.  Conceptually, the session manager isn't the place for this anyway." <http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4805#c7>  "My original assertion still stands: xfce4-session WILL NOT support locking the screen after suspend.  I've already explained why and I don't intend to rehash this." <http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4805#c23>  I think we should just remove the buttons from the logout dialog to avoid further confusion. This can be done in xfconf, but I'm going to ask for more feedback on the Fedora Xfce mailing list first.  Thanks for your bug report and for helping us testing. I hope this answer is not too disappointing for you.  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 525395](show_bug.cgi?id=525395 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Suspend button in logout dialog doesn't lock the screen") ***   ``` |  |

Screen should be locked or at least user should have that option. Locking works, if you start suspend/hibernate using tray icon set in gnome-power-preferences and if gnome-screensaver is used.

I suppose it is hard to make gnome-power-manager to run xflock4. I have not tested whether the locking works with xfce4-power-manager.

Not sure if it's already been considered, but can we also get this option for xscreensaver as well? Right now when I use my keyboard shortcuts to suspend, I run "xscreensaver -lock" before actually suspending.

For example, xfce4-power-manager calls this function right before suspending/hibernating:
======
void
xfpm_lock_screen(void)
{
    gboolean ret = g_spawn_command_line_async("xflock4",NULL);

    if ( !ret )
    {
        g_spawn_command_line_async("gnome-screensaver-command -l",NULL);
    }

    if ( !ret )
    {
        /* this should be the default*/
        ret = g_spawn_command_line_async("xdg-screensaver lock",NULL);
    }

    if ( !ret )
    {
        ret = g_spawn_command_line_async("xscreensaver-command -lock",NULL);
    }

    if ( !ret )
    {
        g_critical("Connot lock screen\n");
    }
}
======
Something similar could be added to xfce4-session (this is probably too complicated though, it could only call "xflock4").

I've changed my mind; I'm going to reject this.  xfce4-power-manager supports this already, and does a fine job.  It's silly to duplicate this in more than one place.  Conceptually, the session manager isn't the place for this anyway.

I'm planning on having xfce4-session's suspend/hibernate buttons (and possibly shutdown/reboot as well) send those actions to the power manager if present, so when that's done, the screen will lock appropriately.

(Don't worry, if the power manager isn't available, the SM will still be able to do those actions.)

Yep, not duplicating code makes sense. I'm not that sure having a PM on a desktop box makes much sense, but it's not that painful either, so all in all I guess it's a good solution.

Though I'm not sure about your:

Does this mean you intend to fallback to xfce4-session implementation if there's no running PM? Even for Hibernate and Suspend?

Hmhm, but that means the code duplication will stay, but the behaviour won't be the same wether a PM is running or not?

If PM isn't running, all buttons are displayed but everything is managed by xfce4-session (so no way to have it locked at resume for example) but if a PM is running, then it's managed by the PM and one can tune the behaviourr if the PM enables it (and behaviors can be different depending on the PM)? Is my summary ok?

I'm a bit worried by the various behaviour, but I guess there's no way to avoid that, since even various PM can have various behaviours.

To some extent.   xfce4-session will always know how to handle shutdown and reboot by itself (but will use xfpm if present) because we can't expect non-laptop users to run a power manager.

The HAL-based suspend/hibernate stuff will probably stay for now, but I don't plan on supporting DeviceKit-power.  xfpm can do that, and I'm perfectly happy saying "you need xfpm if you want suspend/hibernate to work."  After HAL dies completely (maybe in a few years), I'll probably remove support for it to clean up the code.

Yes.  In this case if people ask "I want my screen locked when I resume," I'll say "install xfpm."

Yes, it's true.  I'd like to keep the behaviors as similar as possible to avoid confusion, but it's silly to duplicate the functionality of xfpm in xfce4-session for things like this.

(In fact, I just installed xfpm yesterday, and it works *very* well for all of these things.  I'm going to keep using it myself, and I'd recommend others do as well.)

TBH I even thought it was more consistent to drop any suspend/hibernate code from xfce4-session and ask people to install a PM if needed (whichever they like). But anyway as behaviors will vary with the PM, it might as well be different without any PM.

Thanks for clarification :)

I got the impression that the only PM meant to be used by xfce4-session-logout is xfpm and it would use xflock4 to start the preferred screen locker. Well, there should be such a locker utility available in order that to work.

I think it is not nice to let user get used to have password asked by the Suspend or the Hibernate button in one Xfce configuration, but have it not asked in another. There could be additional buttons, say "Suspend + Lock" and "Hibernate + lock", that require authorization in resume always. That way user would have decision whether he/she wants to lock computer every time he uses suspend or hibernate.

No, as I understand it, xfce4-session would send a dbus message on the power management bus and whatever running PM would run the defined action. And it's the PM role to lock (or not) using appropriate (xdg-lock or something) command.

Disagree, that would clutter the interface for no good reason.

I see.

Well, it is arguable, whether saving user from typing password unnecessarily is a good reason. But if the interface can't tell you whether it locks screen in conjunction with suspend or hibernate, there is no point in such additional buttons.

IMHO, xfce4-session doesn't lock screen. You hit the “quit” stuff, and there you have choice to logout/shutdown/restart/suspend/hibernate. That's all. How is those stuff done is not xfce4-session role. If you configured the PM for locking, then it'll lock, that's all.

Well, I want to lock computer many times in conjunction with suspend, many times I do not want to lock in conjunction with suspend. (Currently I do the former by gnome-power-manager's tray icon and the latter by the "quit" staff.) I don't want to change PM's preferences each time I have different needs. (Is that even possible for gnome-power-manager?)

I'm not sure I understand that. Are you saying this bug is indeed not going to be fixed because the user can set the desired setting somewhere (in a PM - power manager?) that I don't find?

I expect my computer to behave like this:
a) If, on installation, I tell it to log in automatically (i.e. without a password), then I obviously also want it to resume from suspend and hibernate without prompting for a password.
b) If, on installation, I tell it to ask me for a password on start up (which is the case), it should assume I also want it to protect itself with a password on resume from suspend/hibernate. This does not work. It asks for a password on start up, but not after suspend/hibernate.

Maybe I should understand that the Xfce Bugzilla is the wrong place to fix this?

And could someone tell me how I can work around the problem by manually locking the screen before suspending/hibernating? I don't find such an option anywhere, especially not under Settings - Power Management. Once the screen is locked, I cannot suspend/hibernate any more.

Xfce4-session behavior will be modified, yes, as Brian explained it. But the configuration will be done in whatever PM you're using.

Yes.

If you use Xfce Power Manager, it's in “Extended” options.

Well, neither gnome-power-manager nor xfce4-power-manager have such an option in their GUIs. Maybe there's something hidden in a preferences file, but nothing visible to me.

I had to install xfce4-power-manager and uninstall the gnome version first (don't ask me why Xubuntu ships with the gnome-power-manager instead of the xfce one...), and now I get a locked screen if I suspend/hibernate from the context menu of xfce4-power-manager (but not from the action buttons on the panel or from the menu). Seems strange to me: If it's the power manager that deals with the locked screen, and not xfce4-session, why does that power manager behave differently depending on the way it's invoked?

But after all I can suspend /and/ protect my data at the same time. So thank you :-)

Guys, this is not the place to discuss this.

My original assertion still stands: xfce4-session WILL NOT support locking the screen after suspend.  I've already explained why and I don't intend to rehash this.

Christoph, xfce4-power-manager does indeed have an option to lock the screen in the preferences dialog; your inability to find it does not make it not so.  The reason the panel sleep button doesn't cause the screen to get locked is because the panel sleep button doesn't talk to the power manager, I guess.  Feel free to file a feature request with the panel button plugin, or whatever it is.

If I have offended you, I apologise; I did certainly not intend to do so. If not, I would like to insist that at least in my copy of that preferences dialog (xfce power manager 0.6.2) there is no option that lets me choose if I want a locked screen after suspend/resume or not (CPU settings, Battery settings, Shortcuts, Monitor settings: No mention of locking the screen). I attach a screenshot so you don't think I'm just dumb.

I'll try that. Thank you for the hint.

I suppose the option is present in a newer version of xfce4-power-manager.
<http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/applications/xfce4-power-manager>

As for [comment #23](show_bug.cgi?id=4805#c23), I don't know where Brian J. Tarricone picked the panel sleep button from; Christoph was talking about the Action Buttons, more specifically the Log out dialog (=xfce4-session-logout) launched by the Quit button. The suspend/hibernate button there does not use a power manager at least in the older versions of the dialog as explained earlier.

As for [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=4805#c22), gnome-power-manager gnome-screensaver combination works fine in Xubuntu. Please mail me directly, if you want to discuss more about it.

If the dialog is titled "Log out <username>", having suspend and hibernate buttons there is inconsistent. And it is bad, if user does not know/remember whether screen is locked in conjunction with them.

To have better control to suspend/hibernate and to lock in conjunction with them, I filed [bug 5853](show_bug.cgi?id=5853 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - A way to launch suspend or hibernate from terminal would be nice").
