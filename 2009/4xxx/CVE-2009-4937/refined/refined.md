Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-4936 (note: this content pertains to CVE-2009-4936, not CVE-2009-4937).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple PHP files, allowing for the injection of SQL commands.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Failure to properly sanitize user-supplied BBCode in comments, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**
    *   Multiple files are vulnerable, including `pag1.php`, `pag1-guest.php`, `rss-coment_post.php`, and `rss-pic-comment.php`.
    *   The `id` GET parameter is used to inject SQL commands via `UNION ALL SELECT` statements.
    *   Vulnerable to both direct SQLi and blind SQLi
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The system allows embedding of `onmouseover` events within the `img` tags, which bypasses BBCode filtering.
    *   Vulnerable to session hijacking through cookie theft using the XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Database data can be accessed and potentially modified, including sensitive user information like usernames and passwords from the `smf_members` table.
    *   Attackers can gain complete database access, retrieve any database data, potentially leading to full compromise of the web application and server
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into comments that will execute when viewed by other users, allowing for session hijacking.
    *   Session cookies and PHPSESSID can be stolen using a cookie grabber script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `id` GET parameter in the vulnerable PHP files.
    *   Direct SQLi via `UNION ALL SELECT` statements.
    *   Blind SQLi through the `id` parameter in the `index.php` file.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   Malicious JavaScript is injected into comments using the `[url][img]...[/img][/url]` BBCode tags.
    *   The `onmouseover` attribute in an `img` tag is used to trigger the script execution when a user moves their mouse over the image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   No specific privileges needed; an attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   Knowledge of SQL syntax.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:**
    *   No specific privileges needed to post comments.
    *   An attacker can post a comment that includes the malicious code.
    *   Users of the application must view the malicious comments to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry notes that the vulnerability was discovered on 2009-05-10 but was not fixed as of the publication of the exploit.
*   The vulnerable application is "Small Pirates v-2.1," a CMS/Board based on SMF (Simple Machines Forum).
*   The exploit details specific Proof of Concepts (PoCs) to demonstrate each vulnerability, including the extraction of user credentials.
*   The XSS exploit includes a full example of the cookie stealing mechanism by using a remote script and `document.location` to extract cookies.
