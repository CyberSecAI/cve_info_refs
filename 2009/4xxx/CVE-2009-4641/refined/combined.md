| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=600488#c0)  Chris Coulson    2009-11-02 22:35:45 UTC  ``` I'm running Totem 2.28.2. When I watch a video, Totem creates an inhibitor on org.gnome.ScreenSaver to prevent the session from going idle and activating the screensaver. When I stop the video, the inhibitor is cleaned up (as expected).  However, if I close Totem whilst the video is still playing, Totem does not clean up the inhibitor and this is then leaked for the remainder of my session (hence preventing the screensaver from activating automatically and locking the screen when I walk away from my machine).  There are 2 issues here:  1) Totem doesn't appear to be cleaning up inhibitor's when it closes whilst a video is playing  2) Totem is using the org.gnome.ScreenSaver interface (which just proxies inhibit requests to org.gnome.SessionManager). gnome-session will clean up inhibitors when the owner of the inhibitor disappears from the session bus without cleaning up properly. However, this does not work for inhibitors that are proxied through org.gnome.ScreenSaver, because gnome-session thinks that gnome-screensaver is the owner of the inhibitor. Totem needs to be migrated to use org.gnome.SessionManager to benefit from the additional safeguards provided if, for example, Totem crashes whilst it has an inhibitor open. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=600488#c1)  Matthias Clasen    2009-11-02 22:57:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 146784](attachment.cgi?id=146784 "a patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=146784&action=edit "a patch") [[review]](review?bug=600488&attachment=146784) a patch  The problem is that gnome-screensaver forgets to remove the session inhibit if the originator falls off the bus. It does remove the session inhibit correctly if the originator uninhibits. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=600488#c2)  Fabio DurÃ¡n Verdugo    2009-11-02 23:03:42 UTC  ``` can anybody confirm this is fix? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=600488#c3)  Matthias Clasen    2009-11-03 00:04:50 UTC  ``` I've committed a cosmetically different fix, after review from Jon McCann. ``` |  |

Is there any more info needed?

I already reseted gconf settings for both screensaver and power-manager (when in alpha3) but the behaviour stays the same. Screensaver activates correctly if forced (either by locking screen or with "gnome-screensaver-command -a"), but it appears the idle time detection is not working as it doesn't activate by timeout. Screen blanking (DPMS) never activates by timeout also.

When I run "gnome-screensaver-command -a", although screensaver activates correcly I see the folloing reply in the prompt:

$ gnome-screensaver-command -a

\*\* (gnome-screensaver-command:10180): WARNING \*\*: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.UnknownMethod raised:

 Method "SetActive" with signature "b" on interface "org.gnome.ScreenSaver" doesn't exist

\*\* Message: Did not receive a reply from the screensaver.

I filed a report about similar behavior a few days ago when upgrading from ibex to jaunty and then to karmic, where my screensaver stopped working correctly. Running gnome-screensaver in debug as you did, I see no events at the one minute mark, which the timeout is set to. Using gnome-screensaver-command -a as you did put my screensaver into proper fade out as I'd expect at the timeout, without the error.

One thing I did notice is restarting gnome-screensaver in debug, while waiting for the screensaver to kick in, all of a sudden I did get a DMPS shutdown of the screen, which hadn't occurred at the timeout interval either. I had upgraded yesterday to an updated build of gnome-power-manager (2.27.5-0ubuntu2) supposedly resolving the timeout issue, but did infact not. I did restart it, but not gnome-screensaver, so at least DMPS seems to be behaving, still not gnome-screensaver.

I think the two are somehow related, but I'm not certain if gnome-screensaver and gnome-power-manager use the same event engine (hal,dbus?) to signal "idle" state, or from xorg itself that may be broken. Seems gnome-screensaver just isn't figuring itself to ever go idle, while they fixed whatever it was in GPM. Now that I just tested the DMPS timeout again, I see it's not working again either.

FWIW, another system recently upgraded to Jaunty has variable issues with gnome-screensaver not always turning on at the set timeout as well, really almost random when it works or doesn't. Almost exactly the same output as this one on karmic.

purging gnome-screensaver obviously didnt enable the screensaver, but now the dpms power off stuff works properly, and consistant with what it would have done with gnome screensaver.

I think it's a bit more important than "low" as it directly relates to security of my laptop, but I'll leave it to team interpretation.

I finally got tired of waiting on a fix and just forced install of the jaunty packages that work perfectly:

<http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gnome-screensaver/>

gnome-screensaver\_2.24.0-0ubuntu6

<http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gnome-power-manager/>

gnome-power-manager\_2.24.2-2ubuntu8

I cart my laptop into some hostile environments, and need to rely on my workstation locking in a timely fashion.

Yep, that's right... Now the screensaver activates as expected.

Just DPMS doesn't work yet, but that may be a problem of gnome-power-manager and not gnome-screensaver...

It still don't work for me, even if I'm fully up to date.

I am reprioritizing the bug because a) the sole functions of the program are to provide a screensaver and lock the screen, neither of which work and b) the lack of screen locking is a security issue.

I am still seeing this issue with the following:

$ dpkg -l|egrep 'gnome-(screen|power)'

ii gnome-power-manager 2.27.91-0ubuntu1 power management tool for the GNOME desktop

ii gnome-screensaver 2.27.0-0ubuntu5 GNOME screen saver and locker

What happens on my machine is that after a minute, the screen will blank for a second, then come back to the desktop. After first logging in it worked properly once, but then not after that.

I am reprioritizing the bug because a) the sole functions of the program are to provide a screensaver and lock the screen, neither of which work and b) the lack of screen locking is a security issue.
I am still seeing this issue with the following:
$ dpkg -l|egrep 'gnome-(screen|power)'
ii gnome-power-manager 2.27.91-0ubuntu1 power management tool for the GNOME desktop
ii gnome-screensaver 2.27.0-0ubuntu5 GNOME screen saver and locker

could you try if that's still an issue in current karmic? Jamie your comment seems a different issue than the dbus one, can you look the screen using ctrl-alt-l?

In Karmic at present, the screen saver or blank screen has started working for me, but putting the display to sleep (as set in Power Management) does not function.

I still see this problem on today's Karmic.

Ctrl+Alt+L locks the screen, but the screen will never go into power-save mode later on (it has been like this for most of the Karmic cycle).

ctrl+alt+l works, and actually the last two days I have seen the screen lock and the display put to sleep. I am not entirely confident that the bug is fixed (see Martijn's comment), partially because it would sometimes work for a while and then not. I will report back if/when it fails.

Well after more than a week of testing, I have not seen this faulty behavior. The screensaver works and so does turning off the screen. AFAIC, it is fixed.

My DPMS still doesn't work and is probably a problem with gnome-power-manager. Any ideas of clues I can collect for diagnosing more effectively?

Hey, I still have this problem on up-to-date karmic Xubuntu amd64!

The screensaver doesn't start automatically, but works correctly if I run `gnome-screensaver-command -a' or lock the screen with Ctrl+Alt+Del.

Screen blanking is working correctly in the meantime.

I have the same problem for a Karmic with gnome. Screensaver does not start automatically, but 'gnome-screensaver-command -a' starts it. It worked fine in Jaunty.

I am also having this issue and as stated above, view this as a security issue as I also require the display to "auto" lock itself in a timely manner while I am away from my machines. I opened a bug on this myself yesterday, however I stumbled across this already on going one. Therefore, I have flagged mine as a duplicate in regards to this one. [Bug #473801](/bugs/473801). I have the most recent packages installed as well.

gnome-power-manager -- 2.28.1-0ubuntu1

gnome-screensaver -- 2.28.0-0ubuntu3

And I also never saw this problem in Jaunty or previous.

Browsing around with gconf-editor I noticed that there are 2 keys called idle\_delay. On of them is /apps/gnome-screensaver/idle\_delay and the other is /desktop/gnome/session/idle\_delay. It is the latter one that is changed when moving the slider labeled "regard computer as idle after:" in the screensaver prefs GUI. Changing the other value with gconf-editor seems to help the problem but it still seems kind of hit or miss.

Ugh. This bug is back. This was previously sorted sometime in the karmic dev cycle, but now after release I am affected by this again. At the set time to activate the screensaver, my screen dims to black as if about to start the screensaver, then snaps back to full display brightness.

Due to the security issues involved, is it possible to issue a regression back down to the known working packages from Jaunty until this can be resolved? As of now, I have to SSH to all affected Karmic boxes from my iBook and forcibly shut down the displays. If this is not possible, could someone kindly show me how to forcibly purge the Karmic packages and install the Jaunty ones? I see this was done by a user above, any issues to report with this?

I've discovered upon a fresh reboot, if you do not touch gconf at all and let the system idle. The first instance of the screen saver/power manager appears to work. Over the course of time, the randomness comes back and is ultimately followed by nothing working at all. Could we be looking at a memory/resource issue?

I ran some updates including the proposed repositories and thus far, it seems like the issue has corrected itself ... I'm not going to call it just yet, although so far the screensaver has started when it should and the displays have shutdown when they should. I will continue to monitor for a few days just to be sure.

Agreed, I think a regression would be in order due to the security implications related to this. I currently have to start the screensaver manually and then use xset from my Mac to shutdown the displays remotely.

Is this isolated to Ubuntu? Has this been reported upstream by anyone? Is Ubuntu adding any patches to upstream? Maybe the package owner needs to take another look at those patches?

upgraded to Karmic. I have the bug on the upgraded machine and one fresh

install, and on the other two fresh installs, it all works perfectly.

So, to sum up Kevin's post above (comment 42), the fix for this bug is for Ubuntu to apply the following two patches to their version of X:

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/patch/?id=db568f9eabf3450d8a023597ff007df355b13ea8>

<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/patch/?id=6b5978dcf1f7ac3ecc2f22df06f7000f360e2066>

This will stop X from resetting IDLECOUNTER when DPMS off is sent, which turns the screen back on right after it shuts off.

And will those two commits explain all of the different behaviours here

including everything works fine at times yet at other times, the

screensaver never kicks in and yet other times, the screen saver kicks

in but never DPMSes off?

This started happening on my AMD 64 X4 w/ 4G in the past couple of weeks. It is consistent, in that the screensaver never kicks in and power saver never turns off display (but I can run the command in a terminal and it works). I didn't go digging in bug reports at first because, as such an in-your-face problem, I figured it would be fixed in short order. Is there anything I can do to help? e.g. report hardware specs? list versions, etc.?

I think it's an echo chamber in here -- doesn't seem like anyone from

ubuntu is listening. Anyone feel like setting up a PPA and patching,

building, and packaging a fixed version of X?

That bug seems like it would only occur after running totem, which

doesn't seem to be the case here. (At least I don't run totem -- I

use vlc.)

Could you please try the gnome-screensaver packages in the following PPA once they've finished building:

[https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur/+archive/screen-locking](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur/%2Barchive/screen-locking)

Even if you don't use totem, it could be when totem is used as a firefox plugin, or it could be another application that crashed with inhibit activated.

Thanks!

Thanks for trying to do something. This doesn't fix the problem on my

laptop, though.

It must be something else. I'd really like to try tracking this down,

but have no clue where to start. Could anyone suggest, please?

Well, so far so good for me. I applied the update, rebooted, changed the screensaver settings to 1 minute, waited and it came on. Moved the mouse to shut it off, played some video files, went to some web pages, stopped activity again for a minute, and the screen saver engaged again. I've tried a bunch of other tests, and each time the screensaver now comes on. Maybe others need to completely reboot?

OK, I can confirm this. On a fresh installation of xubuntu, gnome-screensaver never get triggered by the idle timeout.

Is anyone else having issues with gnome-screensaver that is \_not\_ using xubuntu and is still seeing issues with the gnome-screensaver package in my PPA?

Basically, the newer gnome-screensaver uses gnome-session for the idle timeout. Xubuntu doesn't use gnome-session, so gnome-screensaver doesn't work. Here is the upstream bug report for the issue:

Hey, I've just removed gnome-screensaver and installed xscreensaver instead. It doesn't work either!

Can it be something is broken on some lower level?

I've re-logged in, checked that xscreensaver process is running, adjusted settings to activate after 1 minute of idle time--and it didn't work, just like before. Still it can be activated with Ctrl+Alt+Del three finger salute.

On an aside note, couldn't we patch gnome-screensaver to fallback to earlier behaviour if it sees that gnome-session isn't running?

Oh, I take it back--after a restart it finally worked with xscreensaver.

My question about patching gnome-screensaver is still actual I think.

Using Mythbuntu 9.10 (xfce)

1. Edited /etc/sources.list and inserted gpg pub key manually

2. updated, upgraded, and rebooted.

3. Confirmed GUI settings: 1min idle, no screen lock, blank screensaver

Result: Unsuccessful.

For your convenience, see attached if you like. Thanks for your work on this.

Sorry, it looks like your fix doesn't apply to me since I'm using xfce. Sorry to waste your time. I wonder what mythbuntu users are supposed to do about this now.

OK, I've moved the gnome-screensaver issue when used with xfce (xubuntu, mythbuntu) into [bug #493573](/bugs/493573) so it doesn't get lost when this bug gets closed.

Still broken here after applying update and rebooting. Screen fades to black at correct timeout, but screensaver is not displayed. Instead, the display snaps back to full brightness immediately.

Filed [Bug #494114](/bugs/494114) hoping it does get properly looked at. Unfortunately, I followed this bug throughout karmic dev cycle and at one point around end of August the screensaver was completely functional. Looks like I've had a different bug for some time now.

If your screen starts to fade at the correct idle timeout, but the screensaver is not shown, please do refer to my aforementioned bug.

# USN-866-1: gnome-screensaver vulnerability

7 December 2009

gnome-screensaver vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)

## Packages

* [gnome-screensaver](/security/cves?package=gnome-screensaver) -

## Details

It was discovered that gnome-screensaver did not always re-enable itself

after applications requested it to ignore idle timers. This may result in the

screen not being automatically locked after the inactivity timeout is

reached, permitting an attacker with physical access to gain access to an

unlocked session.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.10

* [gnome-screensaver](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnome-screensaver)
  -
  [2.28.0-0ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnome-screensaver/2.28.0-0ubuntu3.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart your session to effect

the necessary changes.
