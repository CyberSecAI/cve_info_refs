| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=546580#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-12-11 09:57:58 UTC  ``` Marc Schoenefeld found a stack-based buffer overflow in the way netpbm graphics file formats handling library used to process content of header fields of the X PixMap (XPM) image file. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XPM image file and trick the local user into processing it, which would lead to denial of service (crash of application using the netpbm library) or, potentially, to execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of that application.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=546580#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-12-11 10:27:45 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the netpbm package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.  This issue affects the versions of the netpbm package, as shipped with Fedora release of 10, 11, and 12.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=546580#c5)  Jindrich Novy    2009-12-11 18:09:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 377777](attachment.cgi?id=377777&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=377777&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  I have inspected the code and it looks like a next of the upstream thinko series.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : netpbm-free
Vulnerability  : stack-based buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2009-4274
Debian Bug     : 569060

Marc Schoenefeld discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the XPM reader
implementation in netpbm-free, a suite of image manipulation utilities.
An attacker could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code via an XPM image file that contains a crafted header
field associated with a large color index value.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:10.0-12+lenny1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:10.0-12.1+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

Due to a problem with the archive system it is not possible to release
all architectures. The missing architectures will be installed into the
archive once they become available.

We recommend that you upgrade your netpbm-free package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Message-ID: <20100209180311.GE2377@redhat.com>
Date: Tue, 9 Feb 2010 11:03:11 -0700
From: Vincent Danen <vdanen@...hat.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: vulnerability in netpbm (CVE-2009-4274)

Marc Schoenefeld discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the way
that netpbm processed the contents of header files in xpm image files.
This could lead to a crash of the application processing a
specially-crafted xpm file (and linked to netpbm), or possibly to the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user processing
the xpm file.  This issue is assigned CVE-2009-4274.

The issue was corrected upstream in version 10.47.07 on Dec 29, 2009:

<http://netpbm.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/netpbm/stable/converter/ppm/xpmtoppm.c?view=patch&r1=995&r2=1076&pathrev=1076>

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
