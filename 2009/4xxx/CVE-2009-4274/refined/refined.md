  "CVE-2009-4274": {
    "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the netpbm graphics file formats handling library when processing header fields of the X PixMap (XPM) image file. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XPM image file and trick the local user into processing it, leading to denial of service (crash of application using the netpbm library) or potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of that application.",

    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a stack-based buffer overflow in the way netpbm processes the contents of header fields in XPM image files.",

    "impact": "An attacker could cause a denial of service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user processing the XPM file.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted XPM image file, and tricking a user into processing it.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted XPM file to the user, which could be through a website or email.",
