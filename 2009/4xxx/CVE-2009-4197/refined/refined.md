  "vulnerability_information": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2009-4197",
      "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation in multiple web forms of the Huawei MT882 modem/router.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple POST parameters across various web forms.",
         "User credentials are sent in clear text over unencrypted HTTP connections.",
         "Password fields have autocomplete enabled, potentially exposing passwords stored in the browser cache to local attackers."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, steal session cookies, impersonate users, modify page content, and potentially compromise sensitive data. Transmitting credentials in cleartext exposes them to interception. Autocomplete on password fields can lead to local disclosure of sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vectors involve sending crafted HTTP POST requests to vulnerable web forms with malicious JavaScript code injected into various input fields. The cleartext transmission and autocomplete vulnerabilities can be exploited by intercepting HTTP traffic and local access to the device, respectively.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the router, typically requiring access to the local network where the device is connected. For the cleartext and autocomplete issues, eavesdropping on the network or local access is required."
