Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4560

**Vulnerable Software:** WebLeague 2.2.0

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `profile.php` script in WebLeague 2.2.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection.  The `name` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input sanitization in `profile.php`.
- Direct use of user-supplied data in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can bypass authentication, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials.
- Attackers can manipulate or delete data within the database.
- Full control of the database server is possible in some scenarios.
- In this specific exploit, the attacker is attempting to dump the username and password from the admin table, webl_admin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP GET request using the `name` parameter in `profile.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability (it is available to the public)

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit provided is: `profile.php?name='+UNION+SELECT+1,password,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22+FROM+webl_admin%23`
- This demonstrates an attacker using a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve data from the `webl_admin` table and retrieve the password field.
