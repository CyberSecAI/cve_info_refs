{
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `inc_dir` parameter of the `config.php` file, which is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "impact": "An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application, specifically targeting the `config.php` file and supplying a malicious URL through the `inc_dir` parameter."
  ],
  "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and have access to a web server to host the malicious file."
