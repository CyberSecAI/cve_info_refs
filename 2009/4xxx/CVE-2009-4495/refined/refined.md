The provided content describes a vulnerability related to log escape sequence injection affecting multiple web servers, including Yaws.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that these web servers log user-supplied data (e.g., HTTP request paths, headers) into log files without proper sanitization. This allows attackers to inject terminal escape sequences into the logs. When these logs are viewed in a terminal using tools like `cat` or `tail`, or when the web server is run in the foreground in a pty, the escape sequences are interpreted by the terminal, leading to potential attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Log Injection:** The core vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied data before logging, specifically regarding terminal escape sequences.
*   **Terminal Escape Sequence Interpretation:** The terminal's interpretation of these sequences, designed to perform special operations (like executing commands or dumping buffer to a file), leads to the possibility of arbitrary actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly mentioned, it's implied that by using crafted escape sequences, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system if the log output is directly displayed on a user's terminal.
*   **Log Manipulation:** Attackers could use escape sequences to manipulate the terminal output, potentially hiding malicious activities or creating false output.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The primary attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests. Specifically, the request path or headers can contain the malicious escape sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server to send the malicious HTTP requests.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be capable of crafting HTTP requests that contain specific escape sequences in the request path or header fields.

**Specifics regarding Yaws (CVE-2009-4495):**
*   The vulnerability affects Yaws version 1.85.
*   The proof of concept involves sending a request with an escape sequence, such as `curl -kis http://localhost/%1b%5d%32%3b%6f%77%6e%65%64%07%0a`.
