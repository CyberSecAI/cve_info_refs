{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2009-4146",
      "root_cause": "The `unsetenv()` calls were not checked for errors, allowing the program to proceed even if unsetting of environment variables failed which resulted in insecure environment variables persisting.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure handling of environment variables",
        "Lack of error checking on `unsetenv()` calls"
      ],
      "impact": "If `unsetenv()` fails (for example due to memory corruption, or some other unusual condition) the insecure environment variables will persist, leading to potential compromise of the process.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Memory corruption",
        "Unusual system state"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to create an environment where `unsetenv()` will fail, typically by memory corruption"
