The provided content relates to CVE-2009-4965. It is a security advisory for multiple third-party extensions of TYPO3 CMS, all affected by SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   SQL Injection vulnerabilities exist in several third-party TYPO3 extensions. This means that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query and gain unauthorized access or modify data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability across all listed extensions is SQL Injection. This allows attackers to potentially:
    *   Bypass authentication
    *   Read sensitive data
    *   Modify or delete data
    *   Potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The Solidbase Bannermanagement (SBbanner) extension is specifically noted to have a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability. This means the attacker might not see direct output from the database, but can still infer information by observing the application's behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:**  An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data, leading to loss of integrity.
*   **Service Disruption:**  In some scenarios, manipulation of the database might lead to application errors or unavailability.
*   **Account compromise:** In some cases SQL Injection could be used to gain access to administrator accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the vulnerable third-party extensions. Input fields or parameters within these extensions that interact with the database are exploited by crafting malicious SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable extension:** An attacker needs to know which TYPO3 extensions are vulnerable.
*   **Access to the TYPO3 instance:**  The attacker must be able to send malicious requests to the vulnerable TYPO3 instance.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection techniques:** The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL queries designed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Extensions and Versions:**

*   **AIRware Lexicon (air\_lexicon):** Version 0.0.1
*   **AST ZipCodeSearch (ast\_addresszipsearch):** Version 0.5.4
*   **Car (car):** Version 0.1.0 and below
*   **Event Registration (event\_registr):** Version 1.0.0 and below
*   **Solidbase Bannermanagement (SBbanner):** Version 1.0.1
*   **t3m\_affiliate (t3m\_affiliate):** Version 0.5.0
*   **AJAX Chat (vjchat):** Version 0.3.2 and below

**Solutions:**

*   **Removal:** For some extensions, the recommended action is to completely uninstall and delete all files related to the vulnerable extension (AIRware Lexicon, AST ZipCodeSearch, Event Registration, Solidbase Bannermanagement, t3m\_affiliate).
*   **Update:** For the Car and AJAX Chat extensions, updated versions are available (0.1.1 and 0.3.3 respectively).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that this is a Collective Security Bulletin (CSB) because the affected extensions do not have significant download numbers.
*   The TYPO3 security team encourages users to subscribe to the typo3-announce mailing list for future security bulletins and follow best practices as outlined in the TYPO3 SECURITY Guide.
