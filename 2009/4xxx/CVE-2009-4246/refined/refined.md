Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4246:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in RealNetworks RealPlayer during the parsing of malformed .RJS skin files. Specifically, when loading a skin, the application copies variable-length fields from the "web.xmb" file into a fixed-size buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** A statically sized buffer is used to store data from a variable-length field, which can be overflowed if the attacker supplies overly long data in the .RJS skin file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the RealPlayer application on the victim's machine. This can lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious website:** An attacker could host a malicious website that prompts the user to switch to a specially crafted skin.
- **Malicious file:** An attacker could distribute a malicious .RJS skin file that, when opened, triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious .RJS skin file to the victim through a website or file distribution method.
- The attacker requires that the victim interacts with the malicious skin and agrees to switch to it.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the skin parsing functionality of RealPlayer.
- User interaction is required, as the user must agree to switch to the malicious skin.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- RealNetworks has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Peter Vreugdenhil.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['8493'].
