{
  "CVE-2009-4816": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the `filename` parameter in `download_checker.php`, allowing directory traversal.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "File Disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive configuration files. In this specific case, the `config.inc.php` file containing database credentials is exposed, leading to full compromise of the database.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `download_checker.php` script, providing the path to a file through the `filename` parameter using directory traversal techniques (e.g. `../`).",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and must be able to access the `download_checker.php` endpoint."
