  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-4196",
      "root_cause": "The web interface of the Huawei MT882 modem/router does not properly sanitize user-supplied input.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in multiple forms due to a lack of input validation."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious code (usually JavaScript) into the vulnerable forms. This can allow the attacker to steal session cookies, take over user accounts, modify the content presented to the user, and potentially compromise sensitive data, including login credentials.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through the web interface of the modem/router, by injecting malicious code into POST parameters of various forms.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web interface of the device. This could be achieved either from the local network or potentially remotely if the device's web interface is exposed to the internet.",
       "additional_details": "The report provides a long list of specific POST parameters that are vulnerable to XSS, along with examples of injected code. It also highlights that user credentials are sent in clear text and that password fields have autocomplete enabled which can also lead to sensitive information disclosure."
