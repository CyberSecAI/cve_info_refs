# Drupal 6.x Core XSS Vulnerability

[disclosure](/tag/disclosure) [drupal](/tag/drupal)
30 November -0001
#### Description of Vulnerability:

Drupal (http://drupal.org) is a robust content management system (CMS) written in PHP and MySQL that provides extensibility through various third party modules. The Locale module "Enables the translation of the user interface to languages other than English." The Local module is one of the Drupal core modules, distributed with every Drupal site, but not enabled by default.

#### Systems affected:

Drupal 6.14 was tested and shown to be vulnerable.

#### Impact:

XSS vulnerabilities may expose site administrative accounts to compromise which could lead to web server process compromise.

#### Mitigating factors:

To carry out the XSS exploit below the attacker must have 'administer languages' permissions.

#### Proof of Concept:

1. Install Drupal 6.14 and enable the Locale module from Administer -> Modules
2. Click Administer -> Site configuration -> Languages
3. Click 'Add language'
4. Expand the form area by clicking 'Custom language'
5. Enter "<script>alert('xss1');</script>" in the 'Language name in English' text area
6. Enter "<script>alert('xss2');</script>" in the 'Native language name' text area
7. Enter arbitrary values for 'Direction' and click the 'Add custom language' button
8. Click Administer -> User management -> Users
9. Click the 'Add user' button to observe the rendered JavaScript

#### Technical details:

The locale module fails to sanitize the output of the language name and native language name before display. Applying the following patch fixes this vulnerability.

#### Patch

Applying the following patch mitigates these threats.

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
