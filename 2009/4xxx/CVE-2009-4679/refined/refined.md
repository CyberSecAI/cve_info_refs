- Root cause of vulnerability: The Joomla! Component com_if_nexus is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include remote files into the vulnerable application, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `controller` parameter in the URL, pointing it to a malicious remote file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! application and have a malicious file hosted on a remote server that they control.
