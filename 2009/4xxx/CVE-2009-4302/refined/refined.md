The provided content relates to CVE-2009-4302.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the fact that login information can be sent unsecured even when a Moodle site is configured to use SSL for logins. This means that under certain circumstances, login credentials could be transmitted without encryption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsecured transmission of login credentials.
- Failure to consistently enforce SSL encryption for login processes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive user login information (usernames and passwords) could be intercepted by attackers during transmission. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and potentially the entire Moodle platform.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts network traffic between the user and the Moodle server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the user and the Moodle server to be able to intercept the traffic. This could be achieved through techniques like ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning or by compromising a network device in the communication path.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Moodle versions prior to 1.8.11 and 1.9.7.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a "Minor" severity/risk.
- A patch is available, as well as upgrading to the fixed versions to address the issue.
