1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- lighttpd
This update fixes a denial of service vulnerability in lighttpd
that can be triggered using slow requests.
(CVE-2010-0295: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0-11.2, SLE10, SLE11
- net-snmp/libsnmp15/perl-SNMP
This update of net-snmp fixes the following bugs:
- truncated walk of hrSWRunPath
- crash when 64-bit counters wrap
- unknown host names in snmp traps
- sensitive host information disclosure
(CVE-2008-6123: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- fuse
A race condition in fusermount allowed users to umount any
filesystem (CVE-2009-3297: CVSS v2 Base Score: 1.7).
Affected Products: SLE11
- xpdf
This update of xpdf fixes an integer overflow/signed-issue that may
lead to code execution.
(CVE-2009-4035: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.8)
Affected Products: SLES9
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
2) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds
- samba
At the weekend a vulnerability (directory traversal) in the samba server
code was found that allows users (even guest) with write-access to a
share to use symbolic links to access files outside of the share.
The files can be read and modified with the privileges of the user
('nobody' for guest) only.
To disable the affected code path edit the [global] section in smb.conf
and add "wide links = no"

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=541614#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-26 13:57:10 UTC  ``` SuSE reported a buffer overflow in FoFiType1::parse affecting older xpdf versions.  Code snippets from fofi/FoFiType1.cc:   133 void FoFiType1::parse() {  ...  163       line = getNextLine(line);  164       for (j = 0; j < 300 && line; ++j) {  165         line1 = getNextLine(line);  166         if ((n = line1 - line) > 255) {  167           n = 255;  168         }  169         strncpy(buf, line, n);  getNextLine can, however, return NULL:   117 char *FoFiType1::getNextLine(char *line) {  118   while (line < (char *)file + len && *line != '\x0a' && *line != '\x0d') {  119     ++line;  120   }  121   if (line < (char *)file + len && *line == '\x0d') {  122     ++line;  123   }  124   if (line < (char *)file + len && *line == '\x0a') {  125     ++line;  126   }  127   if (line >= (char *)file + len) {  128     return NULL;  129   }  Therefore, (line1 - line) is not defined / results in negative value n.  That value is later passed to strncpy, causing overflow of buf buffer.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=541614#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-11-26 14:05:43 UTC  ``` This problem seems to be fixed upstream already.  line1 = getNextLine was made part of the for loop control condition, next iteration is not executed when line1 is NULL:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/diff/fofi/FoFiType1.cc?id=4b4fc5c0>  This change is part of the commit:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=4b4fc5c0>  which suggests xpdf was fixed upstream in between version 3.00 and 3.01.  Older xpdf versions (2.x) have similar code in xpdf/FontFile.cc, Type1FontFile::Type1FontFile, but the nextLine there does not return NULL.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=541614#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2009-12-16 09:46:58 UTC  ``` Lifting embargo.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=541614#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-16 10:35:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1680 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1680.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=541614#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-16 10:35:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1681 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1681.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=541614#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-12-16 10:35:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1682 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1682.html>   ``` |  |

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
