- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A design flaw in Unbound, a caching DNS resolver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability causes Unbound to stop providing answers for DNSSEC-signed zones after processing a specially crafted query.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Unbound ceases to provide DNS resolution for zones signed using DNSSEC, effectively causing a denial of service for those zones.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted DNS query.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted DNS query to the vulnerable Unbound resolver.
