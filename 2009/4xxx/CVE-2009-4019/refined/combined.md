How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi Josh, Steve, vendors,

   MySQL upstream has released latest 5.0.88 version of their Community Server,
fixing one security issue:

Security Fix: MySQL clients linked against OpenSSL did not
               check server certificates presented by a server linked against
               yaSSL. (Bug#47320: <http://bugs.mysql.com/47320>)

While the other two (three issues) looks too to be security relevant:

* Error handling was missing for SELECT statements containing
   subqueries in the WHERE clause and that assigned a SELECT
   result to a user variable. The server could crash as a result.
   (Bug#48291: <http://bugs.mysql.com/48291>)

This looks to be from adjacent network exploitable mysqld DoS.

* If the first argument to GeomFromWKB() function was a geometry
   value, the function just returned its value. However, it
   failed to preserve the argument's null_value flag, which
   caused an unexpected NULL value to be returned to the caller,
   resulting in a server crash.
   (Bug#47780: <http://bugs.mysql.com/47780>)

Same case as the above, though I can't look into upstream MySQL bugs
to confirm or disprove it. Thus Cc-ed Sergei Golubchik on this mail.

* Failure to treat BIT values as unsigned could lead to
   unpredictable results.
  (Bug#42803: <http://bugs.mysql.com/42803>)

Also this one seems to be security related - upstream bug speaks about
invalid memory access and didn't check the code if this could
lead to heap overflow once the comparison fails.

Sergei, our opinion here is appreciated.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

      [Bug #48291](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=48291) : crash with row() operator,select into @var, and
        subquery returning multiple rows

      Error handling was missing when handling subqueires in WHERE
      and when assigning a SELECT result to a @variable.
      This caused crash(es).

      Fixed by adding error handling code to both the WHERE
      condition evaluation and to assignment to an @variable.

Noted in 5.0.88, 5.1.41, 5.5.0, 6.0.14 changelogs.

Error handling was missing for SELECT statements containing

create table `t1` (`a` int) engine=myisam ;
insert into `t1` values (null),(0),(0),(0);
create table `t2` (`b` time) engine=myisam;
insert into `t2` values ('444:45:08');
select 1 from  `t1`,`t2` where `a` <=> (select 1 union select 2) into @`var0`;

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=540906#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-11-24 13:55:20 UTC  ``` Multiple denial of service flaws were found in MySQL SQL database server. Quoting from upstream 5.0.88 release notes:  * Error handling was missing for SELECT statements containing subqueries in the WHERE clause and that assigned a SELECT result to a user variable. The server could crash as a result. (Bug#48291)  * If the first argument to GeomFromWKB() function was a geometry value, the function just returned its value. However, it failed to preserve the argument's null_value flag, which caused an unexpected NULL value to be returned to the caller, resulting in a server crash.

Package        : mysql-dfsg-5.0
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-4019 CVE-2009-4030 CVE-2009-4484

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL
database server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2009-4019

Domas Mituzas discovered that mysqld does not properly handle errors during
execution of certain SELECT statements with subqueries, and does not preserve
certain null_value flags during execution of statements that use the
GeomFromWKB function, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a
denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted statement.

CVE-2009-4030

Sergei Golubchik discovered that MySQL allows local users to bypass certain
privilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified
DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are originally associated
with pathnames without symlinks, and that can point to tables created at
a future time at which a pathname is modified to contain a symlink to a
subdirectory of the MySQL data home directory.

CVE-2009-4484

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the CertDecoder::GetName function
in src/asn.cpp in TaoCrypt in yaSSL before 1.9.9, as used in mysqld, allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(memory corruption and daemon crash) by establishing an SSL connection and
sending an X.509 client certificate with a crafted name field.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch12

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.51a-24+lenny3

The testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution do not contain
mysql-dfsg-5 anymore.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.

How to repeat:
drop table if exists `t1`;
create table `t1`(`c0` bigint,`c3` multipolygon);
insert into `t1` values
(0,geomfromtext('multipolygon(((1 2,3 4,5 6,7 8,9 8),(7 6,5 4,3 2,1 2,3 4)))'));
select 1 from `t1` where
`c0` <>  (select geometrycollectionfromwkb(`c3`) from `t1`);

      [Bug #47780](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=47780): crash when comparing GIS items from subquery

      If the first argument to GeomFromWKB function is a geometry
      field then the function just returns its value.
      However in doing so it's not preserving first argument's
      null_value flag and this causes unexpected null value to
      be returned to the calling function.

      Fixed by updating the null_value of the GeomFromWKB function
      in such cases.

If the first argument to GeomFromWKB() function was a geometry value,
the function just returned its value. However, it failed to preserve
the argument's null_value flag, which caused an unexpected NULL value
to be returned to the caller, resulting in a server crash.

- fuse
This update adds additional improvements to avoid a race condition in
fusermount that allowed users to umount any filesystem (related to
CVE-2009-3297). Thanks to Al Viro who found it.
Additionally a race condition in fusermount was fixed that allowed non-
privileged users to umount any file system (CVE-2010-0789).
Note: this is a re-release of the previous update with a better patch.
SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2
Integer overflows in libapr could potentially be exploited to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-2412).
Specially crafted XML documents cause apache to consume large amounts
of memory (CVE-2009-1955).
Affected Products: SLES9
- libmysqlclient-devel
This update fixes several security issues in mysql:
- checking server certificates (CVE-2009-4028)
- error handling in subqueries (CVE-2009-4019)
- preserving null\_value flag in GeomFromWKB (CVE-2009-4019)
- symlink behavior fixed (CVE-2008-7247)
- symlink behavior refixed (CVE-2009-4030)
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cpio
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow flaw that can happen
while expanding specially-crafted archive files (CVE-2010-0624).
It also contains changes for:
- fixed Dat160 Tape Drive density information (bnc#415166)
- fixed cpio issues with file sizes >= 2^32
- fixed handling eof and eod marks (bnc#371077)
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11
- moodle
Moodle version 1.9.8 fixes several security issues including
cross-site-scripting (XSS) and SQL injection bugs (CVE-2010-1613,
CVE-2010-1614, CVE-2010-1615, CVE-2010-1616, CVE-2010-1617
CVE-2010-1618, CVE-2010-1619).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- libmikmod
Specially crafted "Impulse Tracker" and "Ultratracker" files could cause a
heap based buffer overflow in libmikmod. Attackers could exploit that to
crash or potentially execute code in applications linking against libmikmod
(CVE-2009-3995, CVE-2009-3996).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- libicecore
This update of libxmlrpc is not vulnerable to denial of service bugs that
can occur while processing malformed XML input.
- CVE-2009-2625: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0
- CVE-2009-3720: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0
- CVE-2009-3560: CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.0
Affected Products: SLE10-SP2, SLE10-SP3, SLE11
- evolution-data-server
evolution considered S/MIME signatures to be valid even for modified mails
(CVE-2009-0547).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0
- libpng/libpng-devel

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Yes.

No, looks safe. It reads one byte and thinks it's a bool:

class Field_num ... { ...
   bool unsigned_flag;

while it's  somewhere in the middle of a pointer:

class Field_bit ... { ...
   uchar *bit_ptr;

The worst that can happen - MySQL could think the value is signed (BIT
values are always unsigned) and during the optimization phase won't
notice that the condition like "unsigned_value > negative_number" is
always true. Not a big deal.

Regards / Mit vielen Grüßen,
Sergei

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)

* [mysql-dfsg-5.1](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.1) -

## Details

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use the DATA

DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege checks.

This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the use of the

MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 8.10. ([CVE-2008-4098](/security/CVE-2008-4098))

It was discovered that MySQL contained a cross-site scripting vulnerability

in the command-line client when the --html option is enabled. An attacker

could place arbitrary web script or html in a database cell, which would

then get placed in the html document output by the command-line tool. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04.

([CVE-2008-4456](/security/CVE-2008-4456))

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table

files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use symlinks

combined with the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly

bypass privilege checks. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10.

([CVE-2008-7247](/security/CVE-2008-7247))

It was discovered that MySQL contained multiple format string flaws when

logging database creation and deletion. An authenticated user could use

specially crafted database names to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of

service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04.

([CVE-2009-2446](/security/CVE-2009-2446))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled errors when performing

certain SELECT statements, and did not preserve correct flags when

performing statements that use the GeomFromWKB function. An authenticated

user could exploit this to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of service.

([CVE-2009-4019](/security/CVE-2009-4019))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly checked symlinks when using the

DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. A local user could use symlinks

to create tables that pointed to tables known to be created at a later

time, bypassing access restrictions. ([CVE-2009-4030](/security/CVE-2009-4030))

It was discovered that MySQL contained a buffer overflow when parsing

ssl certificates. A remote attacker could send crafted requests and cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue did not

affect Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and the default compiler options for affected

releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. In the

default installation, attackers would also be isolated by the AppArmor

MySQL profile. ([CVE-2009-4484](/security/CVE-2009-4484))
