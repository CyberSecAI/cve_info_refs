Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a cookie disclosure issue within the Active! mail 2003 software. The specifics of how the cookie is disclosed aren't detailed, but it's related to how the application handles cookies, particularly in an SSL (https) environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cookie Disclosure: The core weakness is the exposure of user cookies. This allows an attacker to potentially gain access to a user's session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- User Impersonation: An attacker who gains access to a user's cookie can impersonate that user.
- Email Access: This impersonation enables the attacker to view the user's emails.
- Configuration Modification: The attacker may also be able to modify the user's configurations within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Network Attack: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
- HTTPS Environment: The issue is specifically triggered when the application is used in an SSL/HTTPS environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected server.
- No Authentication Required: The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability initially; they can exploit the cookie disclosure without prior access.
- Simple User Interaction (Medium): It may be necessary for the attacker to convince the user to perform a common action such as clicking on a link or viewing a file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- Affected versions include Active! mail 2003 Build 2003.0139.0871 and earlier, as well as Build 2003.0139.0911 and Build 2003.0139.0938 if their "system.cfg" configuration file hasn't been updated.
- The vulnerability was reported by Kenichi Maehashi of CIS RAT at Hosei University and coordinated with the vendor by JPCERT/CC.
- The provided analysis suggests a moderate exploit complexity, requiring some expertise or luck to successfully exploit.

This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, including information on affected versions, the specific scenario (HTTPS), how the user may need to interact, and the specific configuration file needing updates.
