{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The merkaartor application logs to a file in /tmp (`/tmp/merkaartor.log`). It does not verify if the target file is a symbolic link, allowing a local attacker to create a symlink at `/tmp/merkaartor.log` pointing to an arbitrary file owned by the user running merkaartor.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The application does not validate the log file path, allowing it to write to an arbitrary file if a symlink exists at the expected location."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can append the contents of the merkaartor log file to arbitrary files owned by the user running merkaartor. This can lead to: \n - Denial-of-service (DoS) of applications that require data files to be valid before starting by corrupting those data files. \n - Corruption of other files, which may lead to unexpected behavior, such as overwriting parts of user's bash history, causing the bash history to be truncated.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access is required to create a symlink at `/tmp/merkaartor.log` pointing to a target file owned by the user."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create symlinks, and also have some ability to run the merkaartor application to trigger the write to the log file."
  },
  "fix_information": {
    "fix_details": "The vulnerability was addressed by redirecting the log output to `/dev/null` in version `0.14+svnfixes~20090912-2`. This prevents the application from writing to a file that could be a symlink.",
