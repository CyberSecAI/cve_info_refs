Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4725

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `setup.php` file of the Arab Portal 2.2 software. The script attempts to prevent direct access by checking if `mod.php` is present in the `$PHP_SELF` variable. However, this check can be bypassed by appending `/mod.php` to the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `include("./../modules/$module/admin/information.php");` line in `setup.php` is vulnerable to LFI. The `$module` variable is taken directly from the user-supplied URL parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's file system.
*   **Insufficient Direct Access Protection:** The check for direct access using `eregi("mod.php", $PHP_SELF)` is weak and easily bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, by manipulating the `$module` parameter. This could lead to information disclosure, including system configuration, user data, and potentially other application code.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `setup.php` file. The attacker manipulates the `module` parameter and adds `/mod.php` to bypass the direct access check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Arab Portal application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `setup.php` script, which is located at `/modules/aljazeera/admin/setup.php`.
*   **Basic Web Application Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of URL parameters and file inclusion vulnerabilities.
*   **Magic Quotes Off and Register Globals On:** The vulnerability requires that `magic_quotes` are off and `register_globals` are on for the exploit to be successful, according to the exploit description.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit requires `magic_quotes` to be turned off and `register_globals` to be turned on.
*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) shows how to read the `/etc/passwd` file by setting the `module` parameter to `../../../../../../etc////passwd%00Qabandi%00Was%00Here`.
*   The vulnerability is present in Arab Portal version 2.2 and possibly earlier versions.
