{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `ext4_fill_flex_info` function in `fs/ext4/super.c` lacks proper validation of the FLEX_BG group size (aka `s_log_groups_per_flex`) obtained from the superblock of a malformed ext4 filesystem. Specifically, it does not check if `s_log_groups_per_flex`  is zero before dividing by this value which leads to a division by zero error.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Divide-by-zero error"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (system panic) by providing a malformed ext4 filesystem containing a superblock with a large `FLEX_BG` group size leading to divide by zero error. This can be triggered when the system tries to mount the malicious ext4 file system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Mounting a specially crafted ext4 filesystem"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to provide the vulnerable system with access to a malformed ext4 filesystem. This could be achieved through various means, such as user-assisted mounting of a malicious image file, or an attacker with some level of control over storage devices.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered by an invalid value within the superblock of the filesystem. This value is used in a division operation without checking for a zero value, causing the system to crash."
