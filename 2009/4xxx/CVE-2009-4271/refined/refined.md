    "CVE": "CVE-2009-4271",
    "root_cause": "A null pointer dereference flaw exists in the Linux kernel when a 32-bit user process triggers a segfault (null pointer dereference) after using mprotect() to restrict rwx access on its VDSO page.",

      "Null pointer dereference",
      "Improper access control on VDSO page"
     ],
