## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [ghostscript](/security/cves?package=ghostscript) -

## Details

David Srbecky discovered that Ghostscript incorrectly handled debug

logging. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted

PDF file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary

code with privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 9.04 and Ubuntu 9.10. The default compiler options for

affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service.

([CVE-2009-4270](/security/CVE-2009-4270))

It was discovered that Ghostscript incorrectly handled certain malformed

files. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted

Postscript or PDF file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or

execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program.

This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-4897](/security/CVE-2009-4897))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that Ghostscript incorrectly handled certain

recursive Postscript files. If a user or automated system were tricked into

opening a crafted Postscript file, an attacker could cause a denial of

service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2010-1628](/security/CVE-2010-1628))

Rodrigo Rubira Branco and Dan Rosenberg discovered that Ghostscript

incorrectly handled certain malformed Postscript files. If a user or

automated system were tricked into opening a crafted Postscript file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 9.04 and 9.10. ([CVE-2010-1869](/security/CVE-2010-1869))

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- OpenOffice\_org
This update of OpenOffice\_org does not allow macros written in Python to
be executed without permission, CVE-2010-0395.
This also provides the maintenance update to OpenOffice.org-3.2.1.
Details about all upstream changes can be found at
<http://development.openoffice.org/releases/3.2.1.html>
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- apache2-slms
Insufficient quoting of parameters in SLMS could allow for
cross-site-request-forgery (CSRF) attacks (CVE-2010-1325).
Affected Products: SLE11
- aria2
This aria2 update to 1.9.3 fixes a metalink name Directory Traversal
issue (CVE-2010-1512).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- bogofilter
This update of bogofilter/bogolexer fixes a heap based buffer underflow
vulnerability which could be exploited to cause a denial of service or
potentially execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-2494).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- cifs-mount/samba
This update of the Samba server package fixes security issues and bugs.
Following security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2010-2063: A buffer overrun was possible in chain\_reply code in
3.3.x and below, which could be used to crash the
samba server or potentially execute code.
- CVE-2010-0787: Take extra care that a mount point of mount.cifs is
not changed during mount.
- CVE-2010-0926: With enabled "wide links" samba follows symbolic links
on the server side, therefore allowing clients to
overwrite arbitrary files. This update changes the
default setting to have "wide links" disabled by default.
The new default only works if "wide links" is not set
explicitly in smb.conf.
- CVE-2010-0547: Due to a race condition in mount.cifs a local attacker
could corrupt /etc/mtab if mount.cifs is installed setuid
root. mount.cifs is not setuid root by default and it is
not recommended to change that.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- clamav
This update fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow (CVE-2010-1640) and a
crash while parsing PDFs (CVE-2010-1639, CVE-2010-2077) in clamav
that can be used as a remote denial of service attack.
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- exim
Two local vulnerabilities have been fixed in the exim MTA
which allowed attackers to create arbitrary files or
to change ownership of arbitrary files. CVE-2010-2023 and
CVE-2010-2024 have been assigned to these issues.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- ghostscript
Specially crafted postscript (.ps) files could cause buffer
overflows in ghostscript that could potentially be exploited to
execute arbitrary code (CVE-2010-1628, CVE-2010-1869, CVE-2009-4270)
Additionally ghostscript, by default, reads some initialization files from
the current working directory. Local attackers could potentially exploit
that to have other users execute arbitrary commands by placing such
files e.g. in /tmp (CVE-2010-2055).
Affected Products: SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
- gnutls
The ASN.1 parser for X.509 certificates used a wrong integer type for
extracting a certficiate's serial number. On 64bit big-endian
architectures this could result in bypassing CRL checks (CVE-2010-0731).
Affected Products: SLES9
- krb5
This update fixes a denial-of-service vulnerability in kadmind. A
remote attack can send a malformed GSS-API token that triggers a
NULL pointer dereference.
(CVE-2010-1321: CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.8 (MEDIUM) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C))
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2
- kvirc
This update of KVirc fixes a remotely exploitable format string and
directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2010-2451, CVE-2010-2452).
Additionally KVirc does not further allow remote client to send
arbitrary CTCP commands. (CVE-2010-2785)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

certain RESET ALL operations, which allows remote
authenticated users to remove arbitrary parameter
settings.
- CVE-2010-1170: The PL/Tcl implementation in postgresql loads Tcl
code from the pltcl\_modules table regardless of the
table's ownership and permissions, which allows remote
authenticated users, with database-creation privileges,
to execute arbitrary Tcl code.
- CVE-2010-1169: Postgresql does not properly restrict PL/perl procedures,
which allows remote authenticated users, with database-
creation privileges, to execute arbitrary Perl code via
a crafted script.
- CVE-2010-0733: An integer overflow in postgresql allows remote authen-
ticated users to crash the daemon via a SELECT statement.
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11, openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2

Python-mako was prone to a Cross-Site Scripting flaw due to improperly
escaped single quotes (CVE-2010-2480).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- squidGuard
Two buffer overflows in squidGard were fixed:
- CVE-2009-3700: Buffer overflow in sgLog.c in squidGuard 1.3 and 1.4
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application hang or loss of blocking functionality)
via a long URL with many / (slash) characters, related
to "emergency mode."
- CVE-2009-3826: Multiple buffer overflows in squidGuard 1.4 allow remote
attackers to bypass intended URL blocking via a long URL,
related to (1) the relationship between a certain buffer
size in squidGuard and a certain buffer size in Squid and
(2) a redirect URL that contains information about the
originally requested URL.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1, 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Subject: possible vulnerability in ghostscript >= 8.64

We had reported to us a crash in ghostscript's gdevcups.c, and I don't
think it can be used to do anything more than crash ghostscript,
certainly not in our configurations (compiled with FORTIFY_SOURCE).

Debug logging was added to gdevcups.c prior to the 8.64 release on Oct
17th, 2008:

<http://svn.ghostscript.com/viewvc?view=rev&revision=9165>

The addition of the debug logging allowed for a MediaType string to be
printed, which if longer than the 1024-byte buffer in errprintf would
cause ghostscript to crash   This is due to errprintf() and outprintf()
using vsprintf() on a fixed-length array on the stack.

This issue does not affect versions of ghostscript older than 8.64; for
8.64 and newer, if compiled using FORTIFY_SOURCE (as it is in Fedora),
this is turned into nothing more than a crash.  On a system without
FORTIFY_SOURCE, this _might_ be exploitable, but I cannot say for
certain.

As well, we can't see (in ghostscript 8.15 at least), any other calls to
errprintf() or outprintf() that use the %s specifier with user-supplied
strings (so arguably the vsprintf() calls in those functions should be
fixed, but we don't see an immediate need to do so).

I imagine that most vendors using ghostscript 8.64 or newer also have a
newer glibc and are using FORTIFY_SOURCE protection, but I can't know
that for certain, so this is a general notice that the issue exists.

Our bug report:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=540760>

this had also been reported previously upstream as well:

<http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=690829>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=690829#c0)  David Srbecky    2009-10-18 14:18:55 UTC  ``` The bug is present in 8.70 (8.64 works fine).  The postscript file was generated in Windows by "MS Publisher Imagesetter". (I was trying to print a test page via IPP)  The bug is only present if the "MS Publisher Imagesetter" postscript setting is "Optimize for speed".  "Optimize for compatibility" works fine.  I am running Fedora 11 (2.6.30.8-64.fc11.i586).  My printer is HP LaserJet M1120n MFP (using the hplip driver).  I hope this helps.

That was to a postscript printer though, so it may not have invoked ghostscript. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=690829#c7)  Ralph Giles    2009-10-22 11:51:51 UTC  ``` I also tried printing through cups (Fedora 11 x86_64) with the pxlmono driver, still no reproduction. We'll need more information before we can address this. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=690829#c8)  Alex Cherepanov    2009-10-23 16:39:57 UTC  ``` I think that the current implementation of errprintf() and outprintf() is a security hole. It's quite easy to smash the stack using a long message.  First, we can use vsnprintf() to truncate long messages.  Second, it's possible to write a subroutine that either - estimates the print size and allocates a buffer - or writes the long messages in parts.  ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=690829#c9)  Hin-Tak Leung    2009-10-24 07:46:44 UTC  ``` if you do 'debuginfo-install ghostscript' and manage to reproduce the bug, the stack trace would show the line numbers, etc, I think; or one could do objdump /usr/lib/libgs.so.8 to turn those addresses into line numbers.  Also, one of cups's other log should have the command-line used to invoke gs. Am on fedora 11 x86_64 and can't reproduce this either. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=690829#c10)  Henry Stiles    2009-12-17 09:42:27 UTC  ``` make bountiable and assign to alex. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=690829#c11)  Carl    2009-12-18 02:22:01 UTC  ``` "[Comment #25](show_bug.cgi?id=690829#c25) From  Vincent Danen  2009-11-27 10:18:34 EDT  -------  This issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux due it using the older versions of ghostscript.  The incorrect debug logging code in gdevcups.c is not present in ghostscript 8.15 and earlier; it was introduced in version 8.64.  Likewise, in order to exploit this the MediaType string needs to be larger than the 1024-byte buffer in errprintf, but in older versions of ghostscript, gdevcups does not write out the MediaType string in its debug logging at all.  There are also no other calls to errprint or outprintf that use the %s specifier with user-supplied strings."  Can someone confirm that 8.15 is not vulnerable? ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=690829#c12)  Hin-Tak Leung    2009-12-18 17:23:15 UTC  ``` > This issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux due it using the older versions of ghostscript.  > The incorrect debug logging code in gdevcups.c is not present in ghostscript > 8.15 and earlier; ...  > Can someone confirm that 8.15 is not vulnerable?  That's a non-question - gdevcups.c was not in *GPL* ghostscript 8.15, because it was only merged in around 8.5x ; however, before the 8.5x merge, most linux distribution (including RHEL) were shipping ESP ghostscript, which *did* have gdevcups.c . Whether the gdevcups.c shipped by RHEL in ESP ghostscript is a question you need to ask Redhat personnel and/or examine what they actually ship (grab the src rpm). ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=690829#c13)  Alex Cherepanov    2009-12-29 14:20:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 5827](attachment.cgi?id=5827&action=diff "patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=5827&action=edit "patch") patch  Use safer function vsnprintf() instead of vsprintf() for error reporting. Truncate long messages, issue a warning, and continue.  The patch has been committed as a rev. 10568. Regression testing shows no differences. ``` |  |

# GPL Ghostscript: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201412-17**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in GPL Ghostscript, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/ghostscript-gpl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.10-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.10-r2** |

### Background

Ghostscript is an interpreter for the PostScript language and for PDF.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GPL Ghostscript. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A context-dependent attacker could entice a user to open a specially
crafted PostScript file or PDF using GPL Ghostscript, possibly resulting
in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a
Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GPL Ghostscript users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-text/ghostscript-gpl-9.10-r2"

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=540760#c0)  Kieran Clancy    2009-11-24 03:01:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 373324](attachment.cgi?id=373324 "ghostscript backtrace") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=373324&action=edit "ghostscript backtrace") ghostscript backtrace  Description of problem: When cups prints a PDF, it passes it at some point through pstoraster which calls gs. I noticed a PDF I was working on caused printing to fail, and it appears that some of the debugging output (which pstoraster turns on) from the gs cups driver can trigger a buffer overflow in the gs debug handling (which uses vsprintf - bad bad bad).  I think there are two issues here. One is that somehow gs ended up with MediaType argument without null termination (at least that's how it appears). The other is that ghostscript's print handling code uses (v)sprintf when it should be using (v)snprintf. In fact, ghostscript uses (v)sprintf with an "%s" format modifier over 50 times in the source code, several instances of which are probably unsafe (such as here).  Consider the following code from base/gsmisc.c: int errprintf(const gs_memory_t *mem, const char *fmt, ...) { ...     char buf[PRINTF_BUF_LENGTH]; ...     count = vsprintf(buf, fmt, args);     errwrite(mem, buf, count);     if (count >= PRINTF_BUF_LENGTH) {         count = sprintf(buf,             "PANIC: printf exceeded %d bytes.  Stack has been corrupted.\n",             PRINTF_BUF_LENGTH);         errwrite(mem, buf, count);     } ...  Just marvellous -- ghostscript expects vsprintf to return sanely if it overflows (which it doesn't), and then expects to print a nice panic message. It would be a 5 line patch to fix this so that it uses vsnprintf, and if count+1 exceeds the buffer length then it can print a warning that the message was truncated instead. Same goes for outprintf.  I will attach the stack trace from gdb, the cups error log and the PDF which caused the problem.  I wasn't sure if this was security-sensitive or not, but I ticked the box just to be on the safe side. With all the sanity checking that gcc adds to (v)sprintf these days, it's probably very hard to exploit.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): ghostscript-8.70-1.fc12.i686  How reproducible: No idea - works every time on this PDF though.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open PDF in evince 2. Print PDF to any printer 3. Wait for message saying "printing failed" or somesuch.  Additional info: To attach gdb, I put a 'sleep 20' command in the pstoraster shell script (/usr/lib/cups/filter/pstoraster) just before it executed gs, then I "printed" the PDF, found the sleeping bash process and attached gdb to it.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=540760#c1)  Kieran Clancy    2009-11-24 03:05:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 373325](attachment.cgi?id=373325 "cups error log") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=373325&action=edit "cups error log") cups error log   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=540760#c2)  Kieran Clancy    2009-11-24 03:06:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 373326](attachment.cgi?id=373326 "PDF which can trigger the buffer overflow") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=373326&action=edit "PDF which can trigger the buffer overflow") PDF which can trigger the buffer overflow   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=540760#c3)  Tim Waugh    2009-11-24 12:37:57 UTC  ``` Thanks very much for the report.

(The dprintf2 macro uses errprintf.)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=540760#c10)  Tim Waugh    2009-11-24 17:37:11 UTC  ``` This affects all versions of Fedora.   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=540760#c25)  Vincent Danen    2009-11-27 15:18:34 UTC  ``` This issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux due it using the older versions of ghostscript.  The incorrect debug logging code in gdevcups.c is not present in ghostscript 8.15 and earlier; it was introduced in version 8.64.  Likewise, in order to exploit this the MediaType string needs to be larger than the 1024-byte buffer in errprintf, but in older versions of ghostscript, gdevcups does not write out the MediaType string in its debug logging at all.  There are also no other calls to errprint or outprintf that use the %s specifier with user-supplied strings.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=540760#c30)  Vincent Danen    2009-12-01 00:58:04 UTC  ``` Upstream responded, and it looks like this issue was already noted to them:  <http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=690829>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=540760#c31)  Vincent Danen    2009-12-18 21:37:49 UTC  ``` This was assigned [CVE-2009-4270](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4270)   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=540760#c32)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-05 14:04:01 UTC  ``` ghostscript-8.70-2.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ghostscript-8.70-2.fc11>   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=540760#c33)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-05 14:04:40 UTC  ``` ghostscript-8.70-2.fc12 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 12. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/ghostscript-8.70-2.fc12>   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=540760#c34)  Tomas Hoger    2010-01-07 09:48:51 UTC  ``` Note: This is not a security flaw in Fedora, as the overflow is caught by FORTIFY_SOURCE resulting in a controlled process termination.   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=540760#c35)  Fedora Update System    2010-01-08 19:56:54 UTC  ``` ghostscript-8.70-2.fc12 has been pushed to the Fedora 12 testing repository.
