| [Description](#c0)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-17 12:37:52 UTC  ``` ** Please note that this issue is confidential and no information should be disclosed until it is made public, see "Whiteboard" for a date **  dstat includes the current working directory and the "profile"  subdirectory in the sys.path. This will lead to a compromise of an  account (execution of arbitrary code) if a user runs "dstat" in a  directory that is writable by an attacker (e.g. /tmp) and an attacker  places certain Python modules in the directory (e.g. getopt.py).  I have investigated the dstat history and found that at least versions  since SVN r3464 are vulnerable from this. Earlier, dstat determined the  absolute path of the dstat executable and only added its dirname.  However, versions before 3199 had today's logic of using '.' as the  path to import. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-17 13:11:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 210507](attachment.cgi?id=210507 "dstat-0.6.9-r1.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=210507&action=edit "dstat-0.6.9-r1.ebuild")] dstat-0.6.9-r1.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-17 13:12:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 210509](attachment.cgi?id=210509 "dstat-0.6.9-cwd.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=210509&action=edit "dstat-0.6.9-cwd.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=210509&action=diff "dstat-0.6.9-cwd.patch")] dstat-0.6.9-cwd.patch ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-17 13:12:42 UTC  ``` Arch Security Liaisons, please test the attached ebuild and report it stable on this bug. Target keywords : "amd64 hppa sparc x86"  CC'ing current Liaisons:    amd64 : keytoaster, chainsaw     hppa : jer    sparc : armin76, tcunha      x86 : fauli, maekke  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Jeroen Roovers (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-17 14:19:25 UTC  ``` HPPA is OK. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Tiago Cunha (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-17 15:25:18 UTC  ``` sparc ok ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-18 10:39:42 UTC  ``` x86 ok ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-25 12:32:44 UTC  ``` I have been running on amd64 with the patch for a while as well. so amd64 stable. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-25 15:07:03 UTC  ``` 0.7.0 is released and contains the fix: <http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/dstat/#download>  0.6.9-r1 is committed. This bug is now public. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-25 16:09:55 UTC  ``` GLSA 200911-04 ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2009-11-30 17:00:21 UTC  ``` A second CVE identifier has been assigned to the "same" vulnerability in old versions. So we get:  CVE-2009-4081 : r???? <-> r3199 CVE-2009-3894 : r3464 <-> r8040  ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Alex Legler (RETIRED)   archtester gentoo-dev Security  2009-11-30 18:57:26 UTC  ``` CVE-2009-3894 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2009-3894>):   Multiple untrusted search path vulnerabilities in dstat before 0.7.0   allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse Python module   in (1) the current working directory or (2) a certain subdirectory of   the current working directory.  CVE-2009-4081 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2009-4081>):   Untrusted search path vulnerability in dstat before r3199 allows   local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse Python module in   the current working directory, a different vulnerability than   CVE-2009-3894.   ``` |  |
