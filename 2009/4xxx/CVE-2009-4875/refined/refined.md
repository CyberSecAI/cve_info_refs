Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4875:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of request parameters in FCKeditor.Java. Specifically, specially crafted parameters containing control characters were not properly handled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is present because the application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input within HTTP request parameters.  This lack of input validation allows for the injection of control characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By injecting control characters into request parameters, an attacker can cause the application (specifically Tomcat in this instance) to enter an infinite loop when processing the request. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition as the server resources become tied up with handling the endless loop and unable to serve legitimate requests.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the manipulation of HTTP request parameters sent to the FCKeditor.Java application. An attacker could craft URLs with malicious parameters or use a form submission that includes the malicious characters in a parameter value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable FCKeditor.Java application.  No special authentication or privileges seem required.  The attacker needs to understand the format of the request parameters and the ability to inject control characters.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in FCKeditor.Java version 2.4.2
- The issue was tracked as ticket #3902 in the FCKeditor issue tracking system.
- The fix involved sanitizing the request parameters to prevent the infinite loop.
- The initial fix had issues causing tests to fail, and a subsequent fix was implemented to fully address the vulnerability.
