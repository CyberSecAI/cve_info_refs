How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

We are migrating CKEditor issue tracking to [GitHub](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/issues). Please, use GitHub to report any new issues.

The former tracking system (this website) will still be available in the **read-only mode**. All issues reported in the past will still be available publicly and can be referenced.

Important: we decided not to transfer all the tickets to GitHub, as many of them are not reproducible anymore or simply no longer requested by the community.
 If the issue you are interested in, can be still reproduced in the latest version of CKEditor, feel free to report it again on GitHub.
 At the same time please note that issues reported on this website are still taken into consideration when picking up candidates for next milestones.

To report a new issue, go to [https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/issues](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/issues "CKEditor 4 issues on GitHub") and follow the instructions in the issue template.
