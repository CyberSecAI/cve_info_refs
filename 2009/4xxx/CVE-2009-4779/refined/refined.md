Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the usage of a variable `$spaw_root` in include statements within multiple PHP files (blocks.php, messages.php, and stories.php) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to control the included file through the `spaw_root` parameter in the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The application includes a file specified by a user-controlled parameter, `$spaw_root`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request targeting the vulnerable files, where the `spaw_root` parameter is set to a malicious URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server to send the malicious HTTP request.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Paths:** The attacker must know the vulnerable file paths within the application and the `spaw_root` parameter name.
- **Hosting of Malicious File:** The attacker must host a malicious file on a server they control, which will be included by the vulnerable application.

**More detail than CVE:**
- The content provides specific vulnerable file paths (`/admin/modules/blocks.php`, `/admin/modules/messages.php`, and `/admin/modules/stories.php`), the vulnerable lines of code, and a PoC (Proof of Concept) URL to demonstrate the attack. This is more detailed than a typical CVE description.
