{
  "CVE-2009-4227": {
    "Description": "Stack-based buffer overflow in the read_1_3_textobject function in f_readold.c in Xfig 3.2.5b and earlier, and in the read_textobject function in read1_3.c in fig2dev in Transfig 3.2.5a and earlier, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long string in a malformed .fig file that uses the 1.3 file format.",
    "Root cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the way Xfig and Transfig handle text objects within .fig files using the 1.3 format.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service (application crash).",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially crafted .fig file containing a long string in a text object.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide the specially crafted .fig file to a user, who must then open it using Xfig or Transfig."
