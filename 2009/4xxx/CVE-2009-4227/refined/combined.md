How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=543905#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-12-03 13:25:30 UTC  ``` PEDAMACHEPHEPTOLIONES and D.B. COOPER found a stack-based buffer overflow, present in Xfig, Transfig by loading malformed .FIG files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted .FIG text object file, which once opened by a local, unsuspecting user would lead to denial of service (Xfig, fig2dev crash).

Note that after this xfig will still crash on plane.fig, going into a recursive function call loop inside u_bound.c, till it exceeds its maximum stack size.  This may caused be caused by the use of an uninitialzed variable resolution (for 1.3 files) inside f_read.c:readfp_fig() when calling scale_figure().  Given that this other bug has lingered for quite a long while, I'm wondering if 1.3 format support is still functional at all, and if it would not be better to simply disable it ?  Can anyone provide me with some valid 1.3 format files to see how much work it will be to fix 1.3 format support ?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=543905#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-12-08 18:03:09 UTC  ``` The CVE identifiers of [CVE-2009-4227](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4227) and [CVE-2009-4228](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4228) has been assigned for Xfig by MITRE:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  a, [CVE-2009-4227](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-4227)   Stack-based buffer overflow in the read_1_3_textobject function in f_readold.c in Xfig 3.2.5b and earlier, and in the read_textobject function in read1_3.c in fig2dev in Transfig 3.2.5a and earlier, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long string in a malformed .fig file that uses the 1.3 file format.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Request -- xfig

Hi Josh, Steve, vendors,

   PEDAMACHEPHEPTOLIONES reported [1] a stack-based buffer overflow present
in Xfig by loading malformed .FIG files.

 From what I can tell, xfig-3.2.d doesn't seem to be affected by this,
but xfig-3.2.4 && xfig-3.2.5 clearly are.

Also, the reporter claims about arbitrary code execution possibility,
but I don't think this is possible due the non-executable stack protection.

Anyway, could you allocate a CVE identifier?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

```
Hi all,

I'm the Fedora package maintainer of xfig,
I've created a patch for xfig-3.2.5b, which fixes this overflow. Note that
after this xfig will still crash on plane.fig, going into a recursive function
call loop inside u_bound.c, till it exceeds its maximum stack size.

This may caused be caused by the use of an uninitialzed variable
resolution (for 1.3 files) inside f_read.c:readfp_fig() when calling
scale_figure().

Given that this other bug has lingered for quite a long while, I'm wondering
if 1.3 format support is still functional at all, and if it would not be
better to simply disable it ?

Can anyone provide me with some valid 1.3 format files to see how much work it
will be to fix 1.3 format support ?

See:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=543905>

For discussion and:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=376059&action=edit>

For the patch.

Regards,

Hans

```
