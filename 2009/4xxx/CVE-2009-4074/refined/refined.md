{
  "CVE-2009-4074": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from how Internet Explorer 8's XSS filter incorrectly disables an HTML attribute in response data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The XSS filter does not properly neutralize all potential XSS vectors.",
      "The filter modifies the response, instead of modifying the request, which leads to the possibility of creating vulnerabilities."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to cause script code to run in the security context of a different, third-party Web site, leading to information disclosure.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious webpage.",
      "Posting malicious content to a legitimate webpage."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to convince a user to view the crafted content, typically by clicking a link in an HTML email or visiting a malicious website. The attacker also needs some degree of control on the content of a Web site to be injected, so forums, social media sites, and wikis are potential targets."
