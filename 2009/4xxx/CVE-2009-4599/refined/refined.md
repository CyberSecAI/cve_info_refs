Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `com_jsjobs` component of Joomla. Specifically, it lies in how the application handles user-supplied input within the `vm` and `oi` parameters when accessing specific views.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input passed via URL parameters (`vm` and `oi`). This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database interactions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords (demonstrated in the provided exploit examples targeting the `jos_users` table).
- **Potential for Further Compromise:**  Successful SQL injection can potentially allow an attacker to modify database content, leading to a full compromise of the Joomla application and the underlying server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered through specifically crafted HTTP GET requests to vulnerable URLs within the Joomla application. The vulnerable parameters (`vm` and `oi`) are passed within the URL.
- **Vulnerable URLs:**
    - `http://server/index.php?option=com_jsjobs&c=jsjobs&view=employer&layout=view_company&vm=[INJECTION_POINT]`
    - `http://server/index.php?option=com_jsjobs&c=jsjobs&view=employer&layout=view_job&vj=kaMtiEz&jobcat=Tukulesto&oi=[INJECTION_POINT]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target Joomla application.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** Understanding of SQL syntax and the ability to craft malicious SQL queries is required to exploit the vulnerability.
