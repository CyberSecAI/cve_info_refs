{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `admin_func.php` file of Arab Portal 2.2. The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input in the `sessIP` variable within the SQL query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the administrative control panel.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP Header Injection (specifically X-Forwarded-For)",
      "SQL injection via the 'sessIP' parameter"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `X-Forwarded-For` header or equivalent HTTP header. Basic web request knowledge and familiarity with SQL injection techniques are required. The attacker does not need to be authenticated initially.",
       "technical_details": "The vulnerable code snippet is located in `admin/aclass/admin_func.php` at line 192:\n\n```php\n$result  = $apt->query(\"SELECT sessIP from  rafia_admin_sess where  sessID='$sessID' and sessIP='$sessIP' and sess_TIME<'$expsess'\");\n```\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited by injecting a SQL payload in the `X-Forwarded-For` header (or similar client IP header). For example, an attacker can inject the string `'/**/union/**/select/**/0/*` into the header. This will cause a bypass in the login mechanism. The exploit details also mention that if there are issues with magic quotes being enabled, the payload must be URL encoded.\n\n"
