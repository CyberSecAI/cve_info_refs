How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- NetworkManager
dbus-glib allowed local users to write properties that were exported
read-only via dbus (CVE-2010-1172).
Affected Products: SLE11
- bind
A DoS vulnerability in bind's DNSSEC code has been
fixed which occured while recursively validating a server.
CVE-2010-0213 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- clamav
clamav version 0.96.3 fixes problems when scanning pdf files
(CVE-2010-3434) and also contains numerous other bug fixes.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- dovecot12
dovecot granted admin rights to all owner mailboxes (CVE-2010-3706).
When using multiple ACL entries for mailboxes the most specific one
was not always applied (CVE-2010-3707).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2-11.3
- festival
festival\_server uses an unsafe LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH. Local users could exploit
that to execute code as another user if that user runs festival\_server.
CVE-2010-3996 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- gpg2
GnuPG2 was vulnerable to arbitrary code execution by context-dependent
attackers because of reusing a freed pointer when verifying a signature
or importing a certificate with many "Subject Alternate Names".
(CVE-2010-2547)
Affected Products: SUSE Moblin 2.0
- libfreebl3
The Mozilla NSS Library was updated to version 3.12.8 and the Mozilla
NSPR Library was updated to 4.8.6 to fix various bugs and one security
issue.
CVE-2010-3170: Disallow wildcard matching in X509 certificate Common
Names.
This update also has preparations for Firefox 4 support, and a updated
Root Certificate Authority list.
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3
- php5-pear-mail
Passing specially crafted $from and $recepient arguments to
php5-pear-mail's sendmail.php allowed attackers to inject shell
code (CVE-2009-4023, CVE-2009-4111).
Affected Products: SLE11, SLE11-SP1
- postgresql
PostgreSQL functions implemented in Perl or TCL shared a global state
even across different user user ids. A user could therefore influence
functions of other users in an unexpected or even malicious way
(CVE-2010-3433).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.1-11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1938-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Steffen Joeris
November 23, 2009                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : php-mail
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : No CVE id yet

It was discovered that php-mail, a PHP PEAR module for sending email,
has insufficient input sanitising, which might be used to obtain
sensitive data from the system that uses php-mail.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.14-1+lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.6-2+etch1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.14-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-mail packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

URL: <http://pear.php.net/bugs/patch-display.php?bug=16200&patch=quick-fix&revision=1241757412&display=1>

**[2009-05-08 09:37 UTC] [doconnor](/user/doconnor)**
(Daniel O'Connor)Above patch adds in Validate and validates the from address is a valid email.
This may not be correct behaviour.
This may also still be exploitable by targetting different arguments.

Subject: CVE request: Argument injections in multiple PEAR packages

Hi,

here are a couple of issues in PEAR packages that do not yet have a CVE
afaik:

1. PEAR-Mail Mail::Send() Argument Injection when using Sendmail

Secunia writes:
"The sendmail implementation of the "Mail::Send()" method does not
properly sanitise the "from" parameter before invoking sendmail,
which can be exploited to pass arbitrary arguments to the sendmail
command."

Contrary to Secunia, this does not seem to be completely fixed yet (see
Raphael Geissert's comment in the upstream bug)

<http://secunia.com/advisories/37410/>
Upstream bug:
<http://pear.php.net/bugs/bug.php?id=16200>
First commit:
<http://svn.php.net/viewvc/pear/packages/Mail/trunk/Mail/sendmail.php?r1=243717&r2=280134>
Gentoo bug:
<https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=294256>

2. PEAR-Net_Ping < 2.4.5 ping() Argument Injection via $host

Upstream writes:
"When input from forms are used directly, the attacker could pass
variables that would allow him to execute remote arbitrary command
injections."

Upstream advisory:
<http://pear.php.net/advisory20091114-01.txt>
Commit:
<http://svn.php.net/viewvc/pear/packages/Net_Ping/trunk/Ping.php?r1=274728&r2=290669>
Gentoo bug:
<https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=294258>

3. PEAR-Net_Traceroute < 0.21.2 traceroute() Argument Injection via
$host

See above, same advisory.

Commit:
<http://svn.php.net/viewvc/pear/packages/Net_Traceroute/trunk/Traceroute.php?r1=232735&r2=290749>
Gentoo bug:
<https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=294264>

Thanks, Alex

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
