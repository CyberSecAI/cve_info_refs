Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in **TYPO3-SA-2009-019**, which corresponds to CVE-2009-4158:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the failure to properly filter user input within the Calendar Base (cal) TYPO3 extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection flaw. This means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries, and while they may not see the direct results of these queries, they can infer information by observing the application's behavior (e.g., timing differences) or through other indirect means.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow remote users to execute arbitrary commands on the TYPO3 database. This implies the attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially gaining full control of the application and any sensitive information it manages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Website Users:** The attack vector is through remote website users. This means an attacker does not require any special access to the system other than being able to interact with the website.
*   **User Input:** The specific attack vector is via user input that is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the website utilizing the vulnerable Calendar Base extension.
*   **Basic understanding of web application vulnerabilities:** The attacker must have knowledge of blind SQL injection techniques to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No special permissions:** No special administrative or user privileges are needed other than normal access to the website.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the Calendar Base (cal) extension, which is not part of the default TYPO3 installation.
*   The affected versions include version 1.2.0 and all earlier versions of the extension.
*   A patched version (1.2.1) was made available to address this issue.
*  The discovery of the vulnerability was credited to Michael Tschannen
