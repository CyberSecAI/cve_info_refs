*   **Relates to CVE:** While the provided text does not explicitly mention CVE-2009-4153, it describes APAR PK93783 which is related to this CVE.
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause of the vulnerability is that XMLAccess requires write permissions to the Portal installation directory, which is typically under the WebSphere installation directory. This means that the process needs more permissions than necessary.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability present is an insecure permission configuration for the XMLAccess component of IBM WebSphere Portal and WCM. By requiring write access to the Portal installation directory, it creates an unnecessary security risk that could be exploited if the process is compromised.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** If an attacker gains control of a process that runs with these permissions, they might be able to modify the portal installation or overwrite files.
*  **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability by compromising the XMLAccess process or a related process that runs under the vulnerable user.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to compromise an account that has the ability to run XMLAccess or similar processes with write permission to the portal installation directory.
