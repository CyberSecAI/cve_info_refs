Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `demo.php` script, specifically with the `idTableProduit` parameter. This allows for SQL injection.

*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability. The application directly uses user-supplied input within the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database. This could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration (retrieving sensitive data).
    *   Data modification (altering or deleting data).
    *   Potential complete compromise of the database server.

*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests to the `demo.php` script, by manipulating the `idTableProduit` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication or special privileges are required.
    The attacker needs to know the parameter name `idTableProduit` and the path to `demo.php`.

**Technical Details**

The exploit code provided shows that by injecting the following into the `idTableProduit` parameter:
```
-63+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,version(),11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20--
```
an attacker can perform a SQL Injection attack. The `union select` statement allows the attacker to retrieve information from the database, in this case, `version()` which can help determine the database software/version and plan a more advanced attack.

This exploit uses the `UNION SELECT` technique to inject arbitrary SQL queries. The negative number `-63` is used to counteract the expected behavior of the original query and the `--` comment at the end nullifies any extra clauses that were part of the original query.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit targets "Typing Pal 1.0" which is a PHP application.
*   The exploit was published on August 7, 2009.
*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` to inject a SQL statement into a query that is vulnerable to SQL Injection
*   The exploit was also published on milw0rm.com.
