### AwingSoft Winds3D Player 3.5 SceneURL Download and Execute

Disclosed
11/14/2009

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module exploits an untrusted program execution vulnerability within the
Winds3D Player from AwingSoft. The Winds3D Player is a browser plugin for
IE (ActiveX), Opera (DLL) and Firefox (XPI). By setting the 'SceneURL'
parameter to the URL to an executable, an attacker can execute arbitrary
code.
Testing was conducted using plugin version 3.5.0.9 for Firefox 3.5 and
IE 8 on Windows XP SP3.

#### Author(s)

#### Platform

Windows

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/exploits/windows/browser/awingsoft_winds3d_sceneurl.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/exploits/windows/browser/awingsoft_winds3d_sceneurl.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use exploit/windows/browser/awingsoft_winds3d_sceneurl
msf exploit(awingsoft_winds3d_sceneurl) > show targets
    ...targets...
msf exploit(awingsoft_winds3d_sceneurl) > set TARGET < target-id >
msf exploit(awingsoft_winds3d_sceneurl) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf exploit(awingsoft_winds3d_sceneurl) > exploit
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
