Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4492:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the WEBrick web server's logging mechanism. Specifically, the server does not filter terminal escape sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Terminal Escape Sequence Injection:**  WEBrick fails to filter terminal escape sequences from logged data.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The server does not sanitize user-controlled data before writing it to log files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Terminal Control:** An attacker can inject malicious escape sequences into WEBrick logs. If a user views these logs with a terminal emulator, the injected sequences can be executed by the terminal, leading to potentially malicious actions such as:
    - Modifying the terminal window title.
    - Executing arbitrary commands.
    - Dumping terminal buffer to a file.
    - Other actions dependent on terminal emulator vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Injection:**  A remote attacker can inject escape sequences into the HTTP request (e.g., in the URL) which will then be logged by the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable WEBrick server.
- **Knowledge of Escape Sequences:** The attacker needs to know the appropriate escape sequences to inject.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when WEBrick logs a request containing terminal escape sequences.
- The vulnerability exists because the server logs user controlled input without sanitizing it first.
- Example of exploitation, where an attacker injects an escape sequence to modify the xterm title:
```
% xterm -e ruby -rwebrick -e 'WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:Port=>8080).start' &
% wget http://localhost:8080/%1b%5d%32%3b%6f%77%6e%65%64%07%0a
```

**Affected Versions:**

- Ruby 1.8.6 patchlevel 383 and all prior versions
- Ruby 1.8.7 patchlevel 248 and all prior versions
- Development versions of Ruby 1.8 (1.8.8dev)
- Ruby 1.9.1 patchlevel 376 and all prior versions
- Development versions of Ruby 1.9 (1.9.2dev)

**Mitigation:**

- Upgrade to the fixed versions:
    - 1.8.7 pl. 249
    - 1.9.1 pl. 378
    - 1.8.6 pl. 388
- The patch involves sanitizing output and escaping terminal control characters before writing log files

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that this issue was part of a larger vulnerability discovery affecting multiple web servers, not just WEBrick.

- The vulnerability was discovered by Giovanni "evilaliv3" Pellerano, Alessandro "jekil" Tanasi, and Francesco "ascii" Ongaro.
