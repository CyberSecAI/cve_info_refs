  "CVE-2009-4308": {
    "match": true,
    "relevancy": "high",
    "summary": "The ext4_decode_error function in the ext4 filesystem in the Linux kernel allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a crafted read-only filesystem that lacks a journal.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The ext4_decode_error function in fs/ext4/super.c does not handle the case of a missing journal in a read-only filesystem, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of filesystem state",
         "Null pointer dereference"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service (system crash)",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "User-assisted",
          "Remote",
           "Crafted read-only ext4 filesystem lacking a journal"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted filesystem (e.g. via mounting) to the vulnerable system. The attack is 'user-assisted' because the user must mount the malicious filesystem, but the actual triggering code is kernel-level."
