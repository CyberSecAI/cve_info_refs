Based on the provided content, here's the extracted information for CVE-2009-4017:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from PHP's handling of "multipart/form-data" POST requests that contain file uploads, where PHP creates temporary files for each file in the request before the PHP script is executed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Lack of a limit on the number of temporary files created during "multipart/form-data" POST requests.
-  PHP creates temporary files even if the script doesn't handle file uploads.
-  The vulnerability is exploitable even with the presence of `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` configurations.
- The usage of predictable temporary file names in Windows version.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a large number of requests containing numerous file uploads, an attacker can cause the web server to become unresponsive due to the exhaustion of resources (temporary file creation and deletion).
- **System instability:** Some systems might experience a crash of the network stack and become unreachable.
- **Local File Inclusion to Remote Code Execution (LFI2RCE):** In specific cases on windows, attackers can potentially guess the name of created temporary files to include malicious PHP code and achieve remote code execution. This attack is also possible on Unix systems, but would take a long time.
- Creation of many temporary files that are not automatically deleted, which can fill up disk space

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending POST requests with the content-type set to "multipart/form-data" and including a large number of file uploads.
- Exploitable through proxy servers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to a PHP application.
- No specific user privileges on the server are needed.
- The attacker can be in a remote location.
