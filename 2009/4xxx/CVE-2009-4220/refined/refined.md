```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application's `pctemplate.php` file includes a file specified by the `pcConfig['smartyPath']` variable without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious code, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `pcConfig['smartyPath']` GET parameter in the request to `pctemplate.php`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker also needs to host a malicious file on a server that the vulnerable server can access."
