Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4432

**Vulnerable Software:** VideoCMS 3.1 and possibly earlier versions.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, which allows for SQL injection in the `index.php` file, specifically within the `m=video` parameter and `v` parameter, which uses the id.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  The primary weakness is SQL injection. User-supplied input (`v` parameter, likely representing a video ID) is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code to manipulate the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** By exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker could potentially access sensitive data stored in the application's database. This could include user credentials (usernames and passwords), among other data. The exploit also shows the capability of extracting the database version.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** The attacker might also modify or delete data stored in the database, leading to data integrity issues or denial of service.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In some cases, successful SQL injection exploitation can lead to more severe issues, like remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector is through manipulating the HTTP GET request to `index.php`. The vulnerable parameter is `v` within the URL:
`http://server/[kaMtiEz]/index.php?m=video&v=[VALID-ID][SQL]`
An attacker would insert a SQL injection payload into the `[SQL]` placeholder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running VideoCMS.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques and how to construct a suitable payload for the specific application.
*   **Knowledge of the application's structure** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of how the `m` and `v` parameters work within the application.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided exploit uses the `UNION ALL SELECT` technique to extract database information, which confirms the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The exploit is fairly straightforward SQL injection.
*   The exploit targets the `users` table, indicating that user credential compromise is likely the primary goal of the attacker.
