    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `forummission.php` script and manipulate the `id` parameter to inject SQL code."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided exploit includes a specific SQL injection payload targeting the `cdb_members` table to extract user credentials, and example vulnerable URLs are included, demonstrating live exploits."
