Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-4355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a memory leak in OpenSSL related to the reinitialization of the zlib library, specifically when certain functions are called during the SSL handshake process.  The issue stems from the `CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data()` function not being properly reinitialized after a library reload, causing the zlib ex_data callbacks not to be freed. This occurs after a "graceful" restart (SIGHUP signal) of a service utilizing OpenSSL, where the library is reloaded, and static data is reinitialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:** OpenSSL fails to release memory allocated during SSL connections when a graceful restart of the service (e.g., Apache) using the library occurs.
*   **Improper Resource Cleanup:** `CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data()` was not re-initializing ex_data callbacks properly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit the memory leak by triggering numerous SSL connections, causing the affected service to consume all available system memory leading to a denial of service. The memory consumption can rapidly increase after a service restart.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable by sending SSL requests.
*   **Triggered by Service Restart:** The vulnerability manifests after a service, such as Apache, is gracefully restarted (using SIGUSR1 signal), which causes the library to reload and re-initialize the static data.
*   **Specific Protocol Required:** Exploitation requires the use of SSLv3

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send SSL requests to the vulnerable service over the network.
*   **Knowledge of Trigger:** The attacker must know that the service is vulnerable and trigger a graceful restart.

**Technical Details:**

*   The memory leak occurs specifically when `libcrypto.so` is reloaded, causing static data re-initialization, and thus, previously set ex_data indices not matching during later zlib calls, resulting in a failure to free the allocated memory during the connection.
*   The vulnerability can occur in applications or modules that use openssl, where it is reloaded during a restart of the program.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Slackware, and openSUSE.
*   The issue is a re-incarnation of a previous memory leak issue CVE-2008-1678, highlighting an incomplete fix in the past.
*   Patches were made available that fix the issue in OpenSSL itself, rather than working around it in each application using it.
*   The vulnerability can be reliably reproduced.
