```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Tuniac when parsing .m3u playlist files.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application does not properly validate the length of data read from an .m3u file, leading to a buffer overflow.
- Impact of exploitation: Exploitation leads to a crash of the application (Denial of Service).
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted .m3u file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs the ability to create and send the specially crafted .m3u file to the user.
