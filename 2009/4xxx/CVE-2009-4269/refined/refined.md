RELATED:

The provided content contains information related to CVE-2009-4269.

The vulnerability is located in Apache Derby's BUILTIN authentication scheme, which uses SHA-1 for password hashing. This was found to be easily crackable.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The BUILTIN authentication scheme used a weak hashing algorithm (SHA-1) for storing passwords, making them susceptible to cracking.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure password hashing algorithm
- Password substitution was allowed, which further weakened the security.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could easily crack passwords managed by Derby's BUILTIN authentication logic, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by attackers who have access to the database or the password hashes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers need to be able to capture or have access to the password hashes stored by Derby.
- No direct network access is required for this vulnerability, but network access may be needed for strong password substitution.

**Additional details:**
- The fix includes changing the default hashing algorithm to SHA-256, which is more secure.
- Password substitution is disabled for databases with the fix and using BUILTIN passwords.
- Users are advised to migrate to other authentication schemes, upgrade to 10.6.1.0, set a stronger algorithm, reset passwords, and encrypt all network traffic using SSL/TLS.
- The vulnerability was tracked as DERBY-4483 in the Apache Jira system.
