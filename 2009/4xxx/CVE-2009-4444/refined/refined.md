**Content Analysis**

The content from `soroush.secproject.com` is directly related to CVE-2009-4444, describing a vulnerability in Microsoft IIS. The other content is not related to this CVE.

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is how Microsoft IIS parses filenames. It incorrectly interprets a semicolon (`;`) in a filename, effectively truncating the filename at the semicolon.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the improper parsing of filenames, specifically when a semicolon is present. This allows attackers to bypass file extension checks. Additionally, the use of a colon (`:`) in a filename can create empty files via NTFS Alternate Data Streams, although this is a different vulnerability from the semicolon issue.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Bypassing File Upload Restrictions:** The vulnerability enables attackers to upload malicious executable files (e.g., ASP, CER, ASA files) to the server by appending a fake extension (e.g., `.jpg`) after a semicolon. This bypasses the common practice of checking the last part of a filename to determine its extension.
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading and executing malicious code, an attacker can gain control of the server, leading to potentially full system compromise.
    *   **High Risk:** The impact is deemed "Highly Critical for Web Applications" because a successful exploit could allow for a complete takeover of the affected server.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File Upload Forms:** The primary attack vector is through file upload forms on web applications. If the application only checks for the extension after the last period and fails to properly sanitize filenames, the vulnerability can be exploited.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Upload Files:** Attackers must be able to upload files to the vulnerable server. This usually implies a web application with file upload functionality.
    *   **Web Application Vulnerability:** Exploiting this vulnerability relies on a vulnerable web application that incorrectly handles file uploads, and is running on a vulnerable IIS server.

**Technical Details**

*   **Affected Versions:**  Microsoft IIS (all versions prior to IIS 7.5). Specifically confirmed to work on IIS 6 and prior. IIS 7 was not tested, and IIS 7.5 is not vulnerable.
*  **Example:** A file named `malicious.asp;.jpg` is treated as an ASP file by IIS and executed as such, while the web application might interpret it as a JPEG file.
*   **Alternative Attack Vector:** The use of a colon (e.g., `test.asp:.jpg`)  can be used to create empty files with an arbitrary extension on an NTFS partition, this is a consequence of NTFS Alternate Data Streams but a different issue from the semicolon vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** The document provided also gives recommendations on how to remediate this issue both from a web developer perspective (using random filename generation, strict filename restrictions) and from a webmaster perspective (removing execute permissions from upload directories).

**Summary**
The vulnerability is due to incorrect parsing of filenames, where IIS fails to properly handle semicolons, and allows attackers to bypass file extension checks. This leads to the ability to upload and execute malicious files. The attack vector is through file upload functionalities of web applications. The impact is remote code execution on the server, and mitigation requires proper filename handling, and disabling execution rights in the affected directories.
