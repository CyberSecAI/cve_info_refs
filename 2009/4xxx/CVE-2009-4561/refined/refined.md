```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `Admin/index.php` file where user-supplied input from `$_POST['username']` and `$_POST['password']` are directly used within an SQL query without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection due to unsanitized user input in the SQL query.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain administrative access to the web application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `Admin/index.php` file with specially formatted username and password parameters to bypass the authentication check via SQL injection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable web application. The attacker does not need prior access, and can exploit this vulnerability remotely."
