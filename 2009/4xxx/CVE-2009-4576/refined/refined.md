The provided content is related to CVE-2009-4576.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the `com_beeheard` component for Joomla. The vulnerability occurs because user-supplied input, specifically the `category_id` parameter, is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The attacker cannot directly see the output of the SQL query but can infer information by observing the application's behavior (e.g., time-based or boolean-based responses).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including admin login credentials.
- Complete control of the database server is possible with further exploitation, potentially leading to full compromise of the application/server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attacker manipulates the `category_id` parameter in the URL to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla application. No specific position or authentication is needed to exploit this blind SQL injection vulnerability.
