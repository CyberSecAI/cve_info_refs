The provided content is related to CVE-2009-4346.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerabilities is that multiple third-party TYPO3 extensions contained SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: Allows attackers to manipulate database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- SQL Injection: Could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- XSS: Could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- SQL Injection: Exploited by manipulating input fields or parameters in the affected extensions to inject malicious SQL queries.
- XSS: Exploited by injecting malicious scripts through input fields or parameters in the affected extensions that are then rendered in user's browsers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to interact with the vulnerable extensions. In many cases, this would not necessarily require special privileges. An attacker could potentially leverage any publicly accessible functionality of the vulnerable extension to trigger these vulnerabilities.
