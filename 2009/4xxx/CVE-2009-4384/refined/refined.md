Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-4384:

**Content Analysis:**

The provided exploit-db content directly references CVE-2009-4384 and details multiple vulnerabilities found in "Ez Poll Hoster".

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the Ez Poll Hoster application. This allows for the injection of malicious code through various parameters.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple XSS vulnerabilities are present in both the user and admin panels. These allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** CSRF vulnerabilities are also present, specifically:
         *  **Delete poll by name:** An attacker can trick a user into deleting a poll without their consent.
         *   **Delete user by name:** An attacker can trick an admin into deleting a user without their consent.
         *   **Email all users:** An attacker can trick an admin into sending arbitrary emails to all users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **XSS:** Could allow an attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website.
    *   **CSRF:** Could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a user or admin, such as deleting polls/users, or sending out mass emails.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **XSS:** Exploitable via crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code within the `pid` parameter in `index.php` for user panel XSS, and the `uid` parameter in `profile.php` for admin panel XSS.
    *   **CSRF:** Exploitable by tricking a user or admin into visiting a malicious page that submits a forged request to the vulnerable application using parameters like `action`, `pid`, `uid`, and `do` within URLs in `index.php` and `admin.php`, or using a form submission in the case of email all users.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with malicious payloads and persuade users or admins to access them. For CSRF, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into making a request. For XSS, simply opening the crafted link is sufficient.

**Summary**
The provided exploit-db content clearly identifies multiple vulnerabilities, including XSS and CSRF, in Ez Poll Hoster, which matches CVE-2009-4384. The vulnerabilities stem from inadequate input sanitization and allow attackers to perform malicious actions like code injection and unauthorized modifications.

The content from secunia.com and vupen.com are not relevant to this CVE.
