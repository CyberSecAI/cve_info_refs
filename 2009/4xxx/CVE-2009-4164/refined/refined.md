    *   **Solution:** Update to version 1.2.2.
*   **Automatic Base Tags for RealUrl (lt\_basetag)**
    *   **Vulnerability:** TYPO3 Cache spoofing
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Affected Versions:** 1.0.0
    *   **Solution:** Use TypoScript with conditions to set the base URL in a multidomain setup. The extension was removed from the TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER).
*   **Trips (mchtrips)**
    *   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Affected Versions:** 2.0.0

*   **simple Glossar (simple\_glossar)**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Affected Versions:** 1.0.3 and below
    *  **Solution:** Uninstall the extension and delete all related files since the extension is no longer maintained.
*   **TW Productfinder (tw\_productfinder)**
    *   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Affected Versions:** 0.0.2 and below
     *  **Solution:** Uninstall the extension and delete all related files since no fix was available.
*   **DB Integration (wfqbe)**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Local Command Execution
    *   **Severity:** High
    *   **Affected Versions:** 1.3.1 and below
    *   **Solution:** Update to version 1.3.2 (or later 1.3.4).

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **XSS:** Improper input sanitization and output encoding in the affected extensions, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Vulnerability in kk\_downloader allowed unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **TYPO3 Cache spoofing:** lt\_basetag allowed spoofing of the TYPO3 cache.
*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input passed to SQL queries in the extensions, allowing attackers to manipulate queries and potentially access, modify, or delete data.
*   **Local Command Execution:** wfqbe extension allowed execution of arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Can allow attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Could expose sensitive data to unauthorized parties.
*   **TYPO3 Cache spoofing:** Can lead to incorrect or manipulated information being displayed to users.
*  **SQL Injection:** Can allow attackers to read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially leading to full compromise of the application.
*   **Local Command Execution:** Enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** By injecting malicious scripts via user input or parameters.
*   **SQL Injection:** By manipulating SQL queries through user input.
*   **Local Command Execution:** By exploiting a vulnerability that allows command execution.
* **Cache Spoofing:** By manipulating the cache in a way that the correct information is not displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** Requires the attacker to inject malicious code, often via forms or URLs.
*   **SQL Injection:** Requires the ability to send manipulated SQL queries to the vulnerable extension.
*   **Local Command Execution:** Requires the ability to leverage the vulnerability in the extension to execute commands.
* **Cache Spoofing:** Requires the ability to influence the cache.

**Additional Notes:**

* The advisory emphasizes that the listed extensions are third-party and not part of the TYPO3 core.
* It recommends that users subscribe to the `typo3-announce` mailing list to receive future security bulletins.
* It advises users to follow recommendations in the TYPO3 Security Cookbook.
*  The advisory introduces the concept of Collective Security Bulletins (CSB) for less popular extensions to reduce workload on the security team.
