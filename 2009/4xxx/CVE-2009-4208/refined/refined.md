*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4208
*   **Vulnerable Software:** Open-school 1.0
*  **Root Cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper handling of the `id` parameter in the `index.php` file when the `os_news` module and `show` view are used.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords for administrators, students and teachers.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `id` parameter in the URL: `http://site.com/index.php?module=os_news&view=show&id=[SQLI]`
