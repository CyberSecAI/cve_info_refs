```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `CheckLogin` function within `includes/functions.php`. It directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$username` and `$password`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the application.
- Attack vectors: The attacker manipulates the username field during the login process, injecting malicious SQL code.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to access the login form and input data into the username field.
