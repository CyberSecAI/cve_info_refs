{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient input sanitization and validation in various parameters of the AdPeeps Ad Rotator application.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied data in various URL parameters.",
        "HTML Injection vulnerability due to lack of sanitization in form fields, some of which are sent to administrators via email."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to arbitrary script execution in the victim's browser, session hijacking, or other malicious actions. HTML Injection allows an attacker to modify page content or inject malicious links and content. Additionally, injected content might affect administrator emails.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating URL parameters to inject JavaScript code (XSS).",
        "Injecting HTML into form fields that are not properly sanitized (HTML Injection)."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted URLs to users or submit malicious input through the application's forms. No specific access or authentication is required for XSS, while HTML injection often requires purchasing a user/ad-spot or having a user profile.",
