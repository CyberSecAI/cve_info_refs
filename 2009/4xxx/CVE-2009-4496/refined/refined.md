    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-4496",
      "description": "Boa webserver versions 0.94.14rc21 and prior are vulnerable to log escape sequence injection. By sending specially crafted requests containing escape sequences, an attacker can inject arbitrary control characters into the server's log files. When these log files are viewed in a terminal, the escape sequences can be executed, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution, dumping the buffer to a file or other malicious actions if the webserver is executed in the foreground or when the logfiles are viewed with tools like 'cat' or 'tail'.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input in the HTTP request which is then written to log files. The web server does not filter out terminal escape sequences before logging them.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Log Injection",
         "Unsanitized Input"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary control characters into the server's log files. When the logfiles are viewed in a terminal, these sequences can perform actions like executing commands, or dumping the buffer to a file.",
      "attack_vector": "By sending a specially crafted HTTP request containing terminal escape sequences.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and can send HTTP requests to the server."
