I. BACKGROUND
nginx is a HTTP and reverse proxy server written by Igor Sysoev.
Varnish is a state-of-the-art, high-performance HTTP accelerator.
Cherokee is a very fast, flexible and easy to configure Web Server.
thttpd is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.
mini\_httpd is a small HTTP server.
WEBrick is a Ruby library providing simple HTTP web server services.
Orion Application Server is a pure java application-server.
AOLserver is America Online's Open-Source web server.
Yaws is a HTTP high perfomance 1.1 webserver.
Boa is a single-tasking HTTP server.
II. DESCRIPTION
Nginx, Varnish, Cherokee, thttpd, mini-httpd, WEBrick, Orion, AOLserver,
Yaws and Boa are subject to logs escape sequence injection
vulnerabilites.
Escape sequences are special characters sequences that are used to
instruct the terminal to perform special operations like executing
commands [4, 5] or dumping the buffer to a file [6, 7].
When the webserver is executed in foreground in a pty or when the
logfiles are viewed with tools like "cat" or "tail" such control chars
reach the terminal and are executed.

IV. DETECTION
Services like Shodan (shodan.surtri.com) or Google can be used to get an
approximate idea on the usage of the products.
Some examples:
- http://shodan.surtri.com/?q=nginx
- http://www.google.com/search?q="powered+by+Cherokee"
- curl -kis http://www.antani.gov | grep -E "Server: Orion/2.0.8"
V. WORKAROUND
Cherokee and WEBrick (Ruby) released related security fixes and releases
as detailed below.
Cherokee issued a public patch that resolved the issue but caused some
issues (http://svn.cherokee-project.com/changeset/3944) and has been
later replaced (http://svn.cherokee-project.com/changeset/3977) by a
better fix that both resolve the issue and doesn't affect the normal
webserver behavior. Use the second patch or a safe release like 0.99.34
or above. If you are using Cherokee 0.99.32 please note that your build
uses the first patch.
Webrick (Ruby) sent us the following patch and issued a release
that fixes the issues. Detailed informations are available at the
following url:
http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2010/01/10/webrick-escape-sequence-injection
The patch we reviewed is the following but please refer to the vendor's
article for exact informations.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
We contacted the vendors of eleven affected webservers, counting the
previous advisory [1] for Jetty. Three fixed the issue (Cherokee,
WEBrick/Ruby and Jetty), one will not fix the issue (Varnish) and one
acknowledged the issue (AOLserver).
Nginx NO-RESPONSE
Cherokee FIXED
thttpd NO-RESPONSE
mini-httpd NO-RESPONSE
WEBrick FIXED
Orion NO-RESPONSE
AOLserver ACK
Yaws NO-RESPONSE
Boa NO-RESPONSE
Varnish WONT-FIX
The response was overall good and it was nice to work with them, in
particular we want to thank Cherokee's staff, Ruby's staff, Raphael
Geissert (Debian) and Steven M. Christey (Mitre) for the support.
Poul-Henning Kamp (Varnish) replied to our contact email with the
following email that we quote as-is.
--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--
The official Varnish response, which I ask that you include in its
entirety in your advisory, if you list Varnish as "vulnerable" in it:
This is not a security problem in Varnish or any other piece of software
which writes a logfile.
The real problem is the mistaken belief that you can cat(1) a random
logfile to your terminal safely.
This is not a new issue. I first remember the issue with xterm(1)'s
inadvisably implemented escape-sequences in a root-context, brought up
heatedly, in 1988, possibly late 1987, at Copenhagens University
Computer Science dept. (Diku.dk). Since then, nothing much have changed.
The wisdom of terminal-response-escapes in general have been questioned
at regular intervals, but still none of the major terminal emulation
programs have seen fit to discard these sequences, probably in a
misguided attempt at compatibility with no longer used 1970'es
technology.
I admit that listing "found a security hole in all HTTP-related programs
that write logfiles" will look more impressive on a resume, but I think
it is misguided and a sign of trophy-hunting having overtaken common
sense.
Instead of blaming any and all programs which writes logfiles, it would
be much more productive, from a security point of view, to get the
terminal emulation programs to stop doing stupid things, and thus fix
this and other security problems once and for all.
--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--8<--
We would like to punctuate the following facts:
1) We totally agree that the root of the problem is an unwise design in
the terminal emulators. If in 70' controls were sent out of band on a
secondary channel we would not have the equivalent of Blue Boxing in the
terminal.
This is a known issue from years. We didn't invented this attack vector
and never claimed so. We don't think that design changes will happen in
the short or mid term so it's better to have a proactive approach and
sanitize outputs where functionalities are likely to not be affected at
all like in this case.
Security in complex systems requires some synergy.
2) Varnish is the only program that doesn't need a "cat" program as logs
are stored in memory and displayed using the "varnishlog" utility.
2) Apache fixed a similiar bug (CVE-2003-0020), "Low: Error log escape
filtering", in 2004 (six years ago). The bug was affecting Apache up
to 1.3.29 [8] or 2.0.48 [9] depending on the branch.
Take you conclusion, criticize if you want. In the meantime things are a
little safer.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
