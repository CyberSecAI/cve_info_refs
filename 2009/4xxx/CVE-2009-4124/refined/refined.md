Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4124

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap overflow in the `String#ljust`, `String#center`, and `String#rjust` methods of the Ruby programming language.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when handling string manipulations within the mentioned methods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting this heap overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious input string and utilizing the vulnerable `ljust`, `center`, or `rjust` methods, an attacker could trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to influence the input to these string manipulation methods within a Ruby application. This may not require local access to the target system if the Ruby application is processing user-provided input.

**Affected Versions:**
- All releases of Ruby 1.9.1

**Unaffected Versions:**
- Ruby 1.8 series

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Ruby 1.9.1-p376 or a later version where this vulnerability has been addressed.
