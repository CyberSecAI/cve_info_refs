Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4060

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in CubeCart version 4.3.7. The vulnerability lies in the `includes/content/viewProd.inc.php` file where the `$_GET['productId']` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to insufficient input validation of the `productId` parameter.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious SQL queries into the database. This could lead to:
    *   Data breaches or data manipulation (unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data)
    *   Potential compromise of the web application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector involves manipulating the `productId` parameter within the URL, which is then used in a vulnerable SQL query.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application, specifically targeting the vulnerable script. No special privileges or prior access to the system are needed, aside from being able to access the web server where the vulnerable CubeCart is hosted.

**Mitigation:**

The provided information includes two methods to fix the vulnerability:

1.  **Method 1:** Replace the existing `includes/content/viewProd.inc.php` with the patched version.
2.  **Method 2:** Modify line 34 of the `includes/content/viewProd.inc.php` file from:
    ```php
    $_GET['productId'] = sanitizeVar($_GET['productId']);
    ```
    to
    ```php
    $_GET['productId'] = (int)sanitizeVar($_GET['productId']);
    ```
    This will ensure the product ID is treated as an integer, thus preventing SQL injection through this parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

* The advisory indicates that the security patch was released the same day the vulnerability was reported, indicating an active and quick response by the developers.
* The fix involves type-casting the potentially dangerous input to an integer, which is a standard mitigation for SQL injection.
