The provided content relates to CVE-2009-4975. This CVE was assigned to a Universal Cross-Site Scripting (UXSS) vulnerability in Rekonq and QtDemoBrowser, which was inherited from QtDemoBrowser, a component of Qt.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way these browsers handle error messages when a requested URL cannot be resolved. The browsers embed the full, unsanitized URL directly into the error page's HTML, including any malicious script tags present in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unsanitized URL Handling:** The core issue is the lack of sanitization or escaping of the URL string before embedding it into the HTML of the error page.
- **UXSS Vulnerability:** This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the error page.
- **Cookie Stealing:** If a website uses wildcard domain cookies (e.g., *.example.com), the injected script can access and steal those cookies, even if the actual domain isn't accessible.
- **Crash (in initial instance):** On a fresh instance, the browser would crash due to this vulnerability, but this was resolved and no longer reproducible in later versions.
- **XSS in about: pages**  The about pages, rendered by WebKit, where also vulnerable to XSS through script injection in the title or URL of a page

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the browser's error page.
- **Cookie Theft:** An attacker can steal sensitive cookies from websites that use wildcard domain cookies.
- **Spoofing:** Attackers can create fake login forms or inject any desired content on the error page.
- **Potential for further attacks:** Once the attacker has javascript execution on the browser instance, other forms of attacks could be carried out

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URLs:** An attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript code. The URL is designed to fail resolution.  For instance `<http://thisdomainwillnotresolveandrekonqerrorpagewillbeshownwithfullurlembedded.twitter.com/>"><script>alert(document.cookies)</script>`
- **User Interaction:** A user needs to paste or visit the malicious URL, triggering the error page.
- **New tabs:** XSS in about: pages can be triggered by inserting malicious code in the title of the page

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft URLs:** The attacker must be able to construct URLs that include malicious JavaScript code.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs a victim to visit/paste the malicious URL on the browser, or make them visit a site that generates an about: page with the injected javascript.
