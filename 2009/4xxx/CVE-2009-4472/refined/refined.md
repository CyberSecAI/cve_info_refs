Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-4472

**Vulnerable Software:** PHPope <= 1.0.0

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing for Remote File Inclusion (RFI) through the `GLOBALS` array. Specifically, the application uses the `GLOBALS` array in such a way that an attacker can inject arbitrary values into the `config` array, which in turn is used to specify file paths. By injecting a malicious URL into those config variables, the attacker can cause the application to include remote PHP files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The application fails to validate or sanitize user-supplied input before using it in file path contexts. This weakness is the underlying cause for the RFI.
*   **Use of GLOBALS array:** Improper use of the `GLOBALS` array to handle configuration parameters, allows the attacker to overwrite configuration variables by manipulating parameters in HTTP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server hosting the PHPope application. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands, potentially leading to full server compromise.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker could also use the vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data residing on the server by using malicious php scripts.
*   **Website Defacement/Manipulation:** Exploiting RFI could allow the attacker to inject malicious code into the application, altering its appearance, function, or delivering malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET requests:** The attacker manipulates specific query parameters in the HTTP GET request.
*   **Direct manipulation of `GLOBALS` array:**  The exploit directly targets the `GLOBALS` array to overwrite configuration variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PHPope installation.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to formulate HTTP requests with specific parameters.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know which specific parameters to manipulate in order to trigger the vulnerability. The provided exploit examples give the required parameters.
*  **Ability to host a malicious php file:** The attacker needs to have access to a server they control where they can place the malicious php file to be included by the vulnerable application.
