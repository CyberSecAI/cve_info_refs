How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- IBMJava5-JRE/java-1\_5\_0-ibm
The update brings IBM Java 5 to SR9-SSU.
It fixes a lot of security issues:
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with storing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to consume a disproportionate amount of disk space resulting
in a denial-of-service condition.
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with processing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to retain temporary files resulting in a denial-of-service
condition.
CVE-2009-1103: A vulnerability in the Java Plug-in with deserializing
applets may allow an untrusted applet to escalate privileges. For
example, an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to
the user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1104: The Java Plug-in allows Javascript code that is loaded
from the localhost to connect to any port on the system. This may be
leveraged together with XSS vulnerabilities in a blended attack to
access other applications listening on ports other than the one where
the Javascript code was served from.
CVE-2009-1093: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with
initializing LDAP connections may be exploited by a remote client to
cause a denial-of-service condition on the LDAP service.
CVE-2009-1094: A vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment LDAP client
implementation may allow malicious data from an LDAP server to cause
malicious code to be unexpectedly loaded and executed on an LDAP client.
CVE-2009-1107: The Java Plugin displays a warning dialog for signed
applets. A signed applet can obscure the contents of the dialog and trick
a user into trusting the applet.
CVE-2009-1095
CVE-2009-1096: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with unpacking applets and Java Web Start applications
using the unpack200 JAR unpacking utility may allow an untrusted applet
or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted applet
may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running the untrusted
applet.
CVE-2009-1098: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing GIF images may allow an untrusted applet or
Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an
untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local
files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user
running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1099: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing fonts may allow an untrusted applet or Java
Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Hash: SHA1
Advisory: xine-lib Quicktime STTS Atom Integer Overflow
Advisory ID: TKADV2009-005
Revision: 1.0
Release Date: 2009/04/04
Last Modified: 2009/04/04
Date Reported: 2009/03/05
Author: Tobias Klein (tk at trapkit.de)
Affected Software: xine-lib <= version 1.1.16.2
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Vendor URL: http://www.xine-project.org/
Vendor Status: Vendor has released an updated version
Patch development time: 30 days
======================
Vulnerability Details:
======================
Xine-lib contains an integer overflow vulnerability while parsing malformed
STTS atoms of Quicktime movie files. The vulnerability may be exploited by
a (remote) attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of an
application using the xine library.
==================
Technical Details:
==================
Source code file: xine-lib-1.1.16.2/src/demuxers/demux\_qt.c:
[...]
840 static qt\_error parse\_trak\_atom (qt\_trak \*trak,
841 unsigned char \*trak\_atom) {
...
1535 } else if (current\_atom == STTS\_ATOM) {
1536
1537 /\* there should only be one of these atoms \*/
1538 if (trak->time\_to\_sample\_table) {
1539 last\_error = QT\_HEADER\_TROUBLE;
1540 goto free\_trak;
1541 }
1542
1543 [1] trak->time\_to\_sample\_count = \_X\_BE\_32(&trak\_atom[i + 8]);
1544
1545 debug\_atom\_load(" qt stts atom (time-to-sample atom): %d
entries\n",
1546 trak->time\_to\_sample\_count);
1547
1548 [2] trak->time\_to\_sample\_table = (time\_to\_sample\_table\_t \*)calloc(
1549 trak->time\_to\_sample\_count+1, sizeof(time\_to\_sample\_table\_t));
1550 if (!trak->time\_to\_sample\_table) {
1551 last\_error = QT\_NO\_MEMORY;
1552 goto free\_trak;
1553 }
1554
1555 /\* load the time to sample table \*/
1556 [3] for (j = 0; j < trak->time\_to\_sample\_count; j++) {
1557 [4] trak->time\_to\_sample\_table[j].count =
1558 \_X\_BE\_32(&trak\_atom[i + 12 + j \* 8 + 0]);
1559 [5] trak->time\_to\_sample\_table[j].duration =
1560 \_X\_BE\_32(&trak\_atom[i + 12 + j \* 8 + 4]);
1561 debug\_atom\_load(" %d: count = %d, duration = %d\n",
1562 j, trak->time\_to\_sample\_table[j].count,
1563 trak->time\_to\_sample\_table[j].duration);
1564 }
1565 trak->time\_to\_sample\_table[j].count = 0; /\* terminate with zero\*/
1566 }
1567 }
[...]
[1] The unsigned int variable "trak->time\_to\_sample\_count" is filled with
user supplied data from the media file.
[2] In the lines 1548 and 1549 an integer overflow happens as the first
argument to calloc() is calculated with the addition "trak-
>time\_to\_sample\_count+1". A user supplied "trak->time\_to\_sample\_count"
of UINT\_MAX (0xffffffff) will cause an integer overflow within the
first parameter of calloc() and therefore only allocate a 0 byte
buffer. Please notice that calloc(0, sizeof(time\_to\_sample\_table\_t))
will not return a NULL pointer but a pointer into the legal heap on at
least platforms like Windows and Linux.
[3] The value of "trak->time\_to\_sample\_count" is used as a counter in this
for() loop.
[4] User controlled data from the quicktime movie file gets copied into the
previously allocated heap buffer (see [2]). As "j" is used as an array
index and the for() loop is executed until "j < trak-
>time\_to\_sample\_count" it is possible to overflow the heap buffer with
user controlled data from the quicktime movie file.
[5] Same as [4]

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
