How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## About OCS inventory

**Open computers and software inventory** is an **asset management solution.**

It is an **open source** software. It allows you to **scan** and **inventory** all your devices in your IT Department. Once you know everything about your machines, on **hardware** and **software** sides, you can deploy **packages** to keep your environment **safe**. Many **plugins** are available and give high flexibility to fit OCS Inventory to your own system. [FactorFX](https://www.factorfx.com/) is the main contributor and daily edit the software. This french society guides companies in integrating and supporting OCS Inventory.

![ocs](https://ocsinventory-ng.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/AUTOCOLLANT-03-2.png)

## specifics of solution

### Inventory management

Since 2001, **OCS Inventory** has been looking to make hardware and software inventory of computers more efficient. OCS Inventory queries its **agents** to know the **soft and hard composition** of each machine, each server. OCS Inventory also queries the network to discover the active elements that cannot receive an agent. Since version 2.0, OCS Inventory integrates the functionality of **SNMP scans**.

The main purpose of this integration is to complement the data collected by **ipdiscover.** Using SNMP scans will allow you to insert a lot of information about your network hardware: printers, switches, computers (which do not have an OCS agent installed), etc. SNMP scans will be performed by OCS agents based on IP addresses collected by ipdiscover.

### The remote deployment

**OCS Inventory** includes the **package deployment** feature, in order not to control, but to ensure uniformity of the software environments present on the network. From the central management server, you can upload the packets that will be downloaded using HTTP/HTTPS and launched by the **agent** on the client computer. OCS remote deployment is configurable so that sent packets impact the network’s quality of service as little as possible. OCS is used as a deployment tool on parks with **more than 150 000 machines**.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: ocsinventory-reports: Different errors for bad username and for
valid username with bad password
Date: Mon, 18 May 2009 13:25:30 -0600
```
Package: ocsinventory-reports
Version: 1.01-6
Severity: normal
Tags: security

The OCS Inventory web interface returns one error if one enters an
invalid username but a different error if one enters a valid username
with an invalid password -- in the English translation, the messages are
"User not registered" and "Password error". This type of behavior is
generally considered a problem because it permits an attacker to
determine whether usernames are valid.

Hi,

Yes, this can eventually lead to finding whether an user is valid or
not. You'll also discover that the admin user is .. admin !

Seriously, while I agree on what you say, the tag 'security' seems a bit
strong to me. Especially given that the README.Debian advises to give
access even to the login window only to authenticated users (Apache
auth, for ex).

Cheers,
Pierre
