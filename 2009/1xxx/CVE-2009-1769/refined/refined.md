Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-1769:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The OCS Inventory web interface, in version 1.01-6, displayed different error messages depending on whether the entered username was invalid or the password was invalid for a valid username.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability lies in the system's behavior of providing different error messages ("User not registered" vs. "Password error") during the login process. This allows an attacker to distinguish between valid and invalid usernames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Username Enumeration:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to enumerate valid usernames within the OCS Inventory system. This information can then be used in subsequent attacks such as brute-force password guessing, or targeted phishing.
- While the maintainer considers the "security" tag to be strong as access to the login should be restricted, the information leak still allows for reconnaissance.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited by interacting with the OCS Inventory's login web interface.
- The attacker does not need prior access to the system, only access to the login page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the OCS Inventory web interface.
- **No Authentication Required Initially:** No prior authentication is required, the attacker can simply interact with the login page.

**Additional details:**

- This issue was addressed in `ocsinventory-server` version 1.02.1-1, where the error message for invalid username and invalid password was unified to prevent username enumeration.
- The fix was part of a larger update that included other security fixes.
