How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# TYPO3-SA-2009-004: Information Disclosure in third party extension "Frontend User registration"

It has been discovered that the TYPO3 extension "Frontend User Registration" (sr\_feuser\_register) is susceptible to Information Disclosure.

**Release Date:** April 6, 2009

**Component Type:** Third party extension. This extension is not a part of a TYPO3 default installation.

**Affected Versions:** 2.5.20 and all versions below

**Vulnerability Type:** Information Disclosure

**Severity:** High

**Problem Description:** Failing to properly check access rights, the extension is susceptible to information disclosure, making it possible for a logged in frontend user to get hold of information (including the password) of other frontend user records.

**Solution:** An updated version 2.5.21 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager and at <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sr_feuser_register/2.5.21/>. Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.

****Credits:**** Credits go to Thomas Renner and Christian MÃ¼nch, who discovered the issue and Steffen Gebert who reported it to us.

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 SECURITY Guide](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SecurityGuide). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce mailing list](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) in order to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail.
