  "cve": "CVE-2009-1727",
  "description": "This update extends the system's list of content types that will be flagged as potentially unsafe under certain circumstances, such as when they are downloaded from a web page. While these content types are not automatically launched, if manually opened they could lead to the execution of a malicious JavaScript payload. This update improves the system's ability to notify users before handling content types used by Safari.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.7",
    "Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.7"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The system did not flag certain content types as potentially unsafe, which could lead to the execution of a malicious JavaScript payload if manually opened.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Insufficient warning for potentially unsafe content types"
  ],
  "impact": "Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code by a user manually opening a downloaded file. The vulnerability allows a malicious actor to run code on the victim's computer if the user is tricked into opening the file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
    "User downloads a file of a content type not flagged as unsafe.",
        "User manually opens the downloaded file."
  ],
  "required_capabilities": [
    "Attacker must craft a malicious file with a content type that is not flagged as unsafe.",
    "Attacker must convince the user to download and open the file."
