Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1952:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two distinct weaknesses in the PropertyMax Pro FREE application: SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, specifically an authentication bypass.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is also susceptible to cross-site scripting.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** Successful SQL injection can lead to a complete bypass of the authentication mechanism, granting unauthorized administrative access to the application.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** XSS attacks can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser, leading to potential cookie theft or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** The SQL injection vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the login parameters. By entering `'or''='` for both the username and password when magic_quotes_gpc is off, an attacker can bypass the authentication.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The XSS vulnerability can be triggered by injecting malicious JavaScript into the `pl` parameter of a specific URL: `http://127.0.0.1/path/?op=mi&id=2&pl="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
*   For the SQL injection vulnerability, the server needs to have `magic_quotes_gpc` disabled.
*   For XSS, the attacker needs to lure a user to click a crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Exploit-DB entry provides specific steps for exploitation, including the exact parameters to manipulate for both SQL Injection and XSS.
*   The advisory also mentions the SQL injection vulnerability leading to an authentication bypass.
*   The provided information offers more specific details than a typical CVE description, including the exact injection vectors.
