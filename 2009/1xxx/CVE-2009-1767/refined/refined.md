Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-1767

**Vulnerable Software:** 2DayBiz Template Monster Clone

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `edituser.php` file of the 2DayBiz Template Monster Clone application. The provided exploit code demonstrates a lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `edituser.php` script which allows an attacker to modify user details, including password without authorization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:**  The `edituser.php` script directly accepts a user ID (`id=16` in the example) via the URL, without proper authorization checks.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The script does not validate the input received through the form, allowing attackers to directly control user account details.
*   **Password Change Vulnerability:** Specifically, it allows an attacker to change the password of an arbitrary user by manipulating the `edituser.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts by changing their passwords.
*   **Account Takeover:** The most direct impact would be the attacker gaining full control of the targeted user's account.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify other user details, leading to further system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack is conducted by crafting a malicious HTTP request to `edituser.php` with a target user ID and new credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server hosting the 2DayBiz Template Monster Clone application.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable script:** The attacker must know about the existence of the `edituser.php` and its input parameters to construct a malicious request.
*   **No prior authentication:** The exploit does not require prior authentication which can be seen in the sample html exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit example provided in the content shows a form that is submitted to the vulnerable script with user parameters, illustrating how an attacker can manipulate the `edituser.php` script.
*   The exploit doesn't go into specific detail on what needs to be done to successfully change the password (e.g. what is the underlying code) but it is sufficient to identify the vulnerability.
*   The exploit is specific to the `edituser.php` and implies that the software has a lack of access controls over this file.
