{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input used in file inclusion operations.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include local files, potentially revealing sensitive information or executing arbitrary code. Also, an attacker can include remote files, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker controls the content of the remote file.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET request with a manipulated 'lang' parameter in 'help.php'",
    "HTTP GET request with a manipulated 'lib_path' parameter in 'indexk.php'",
    "HTTP GET request with a manipulated 'error' parameter in 'index.php'"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. There is no need to be authenticated or have an existing account."
