Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `gallery_list.php` script of Advanced Image Hosting (AIH) version 2.3. Specifically, the `gal` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a **Blind SQL Injection**. This means the attacker cannot see the direct output of their SQL queries, but they can infer information by observing the application's behavior (e.g., response time or whether an error occurs).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Through blind SQL injection, an attacker can extract sensitive information from the database. In the provided example, the attacker is able to extract the admin username and password hash from the `setting` table. This can lead to complete compromise of the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `gallery_list.php`, manipulating the `gal` parameter. The attacker injects SQL code within this parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are needed.

**Technical Details:**

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how the blind SQL injection can be exploited. It uses the following techniques:

1.  **SQL Injection:** Appending SQL code to the `gal` parameter, specifically `gal=3'/**/and/**/ascii(substring((select/**/concat(admin,0x3a,pass)/**/from/**/setting/**/limit/**/0,1),1,1))>100--++`
2.  **Blind Injection:** The `ascii(substring(...))>100` part is used to check if the ASCII value of the character at a specific position is greater than 100, allowing the attacker to extract the data character by character.

The attacker uses a series of queries, incrementing the substring position and the ASCII value to extract the admin username (`demo`) and potentially the password hash.
