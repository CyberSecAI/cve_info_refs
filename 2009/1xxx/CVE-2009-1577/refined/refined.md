Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1577:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists within the `putstring` function of cscope. This function is used when processing function or symbol names.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `putstring` function. The vulnerability can occur when the function attempts to write a string longer than the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
    - Application crash
    - Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious source code file. The file would contain an overly long function or symbol name, which triggers the buffer overflow during cscope's processing (during a search operation).
- The user must be enticed to open/process this malicious file with cscope.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted source code file with long function/symbol names.
- The attacker needs to make the victim open this file using the vulnerable version of `cscope`.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability other than being a user that can use cscope.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was originally reported as bug #189666 in Red Hat Bugzilla.
- The fix involved replacing `putstring` with `fetch_string_from_dbase` in cscope version 15.6, which accepts the target buffer size as its argument to prevent overflows.
- Patches were also backported into older cscope versions for various distributions such as Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.
- The vulnerability is user-assisted in that the user needs to run cscope on the malicious input.
- This vulnerability is distinct from other cscope vulnerabilities like CVE-2009-0148, CVE-2006-4262, and CVE-2004-2541.
