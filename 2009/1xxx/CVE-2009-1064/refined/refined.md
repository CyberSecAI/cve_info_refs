Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the way Orbit Downloader handles file paths in the `download` function of its ActiveX control (`Orbitmxt.Orbit`). The program incorrectly processes the provided file path, allowing for the inclusion of arbitrary commands, specifically "/L", which instructs the program to delete the file specified after the command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can force Orbit Downloader to delete any file on the user's system.
- **Insecure ActiveX Control:** The ActiveX control (`Orbitmxt.dll`) is vulnerable due to lack of proper input sanitization, leading to arbitrary command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** Successful exploitation results in the deletion of arbitrary files on the victim's machine, potentially leading to data loss.
- **System Instability:** Deletion of critical system files could lead to system instability or prevent the operating system from working properly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable through a malicious web page that uses JavaScript to call the vulnerable ActiveX control function `download` with a crafted path containing the command to delete files.
- **Internet Explorer:** The attack specifically targets users using Internet Explorer, where the ActiveX control is loaded and executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Serve Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver a malicious webpage that the victim will load through Internet Explorer.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The provided proof of concept shows that exploitation happens without any special warnings or confirmations by Internet Explorer, making it possible to execute arbitrary file deletions silently.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Orbit Downloader versions 2.8.7 and earlier.
- The advisory states that the developer was contacted but a fix wasn't implemented before the public disclosure.
- The provided proof-of-concept HTML code demonstrates how the vulnerability is exploited.
- The exploit relies on a specific CLSID (`{3F1D494B-0CEF-4468-96C9-386E2E4DEC90}`) for the vulnerable ActiveX object, which is part of `orbitmxt.dll`.
