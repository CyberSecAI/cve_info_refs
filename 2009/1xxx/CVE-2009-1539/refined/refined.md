  "CVE-2009-1539": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft DirectShow validates specific fields in QuickTime media files. This vulnerability could allow code execution if a user opened a specially crafted QuickTime file. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The Microsoft DirectShow component does not properly validate certain size fields within QuickTime media files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of size fields in QuickTime media files by Microsoft DirectShow."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution leading to complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted QuickTime file.",
       "Receiving specially crafted streaming content from a website.",
       "Any application that delivers web content."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted QuickTime file or control streaming content to trigger the vulnerability. They need to convince a user to open the malicious file or interact with the malicious content."
