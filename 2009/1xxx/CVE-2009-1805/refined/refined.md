Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2009-1805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the VMware Descheduled Time Accounting driver, which is an optional, experimental service for improved guest OS accounting. Specifically, a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists when the service is *not* running in a Windows-based virtual machine where the driver is installed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The core vulnerability is a DoS condition triggered by a specific state in the guest OS. This occurs when the Descheduled Time Accounting driver is installed, but the service itself is not running.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** Exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service within the affected Windows-based virtual machine. This means the virtual machine may become unresponsive or crash, impacting the user's ability to work with the guest OS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local, Unprivileged User:** The attack vector is a local, unprivileged user *within* the affected virtual machine. This user does not need administrative rights or network access to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Virtual Machine:** The attacker requires local access to a vulnerable Windows-based virtual machine that has the Descheduled Time Accounting driver installed.
*   **Driver Not Running:** The attacker needs to be in an environment where the service is not running, and the driver is installed. This is the key condition for triggering the DoS.

**Additional details:**

*   The VMware advisory mentions that the Descheduled Time Accounting Service is no longer provided in newer versions of VMware Tools.
*   Migration of older virtual machines to newer platforms could still be vulnerable if the tools are not updated.
*   The advisory includes specific steps for remediation depending on the affected product (VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion, ESX, ESXi).
*   The advisory also notes that users will *not* be prompted to update their VMware Tools in ESX environments and that it must be done manually.
