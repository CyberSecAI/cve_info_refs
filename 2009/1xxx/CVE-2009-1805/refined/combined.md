How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. VMware Descheduled Time Accounting driver vulnerability may cause a denial of service in Windows based virtual machines.

The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting Service is an optional,
experimental service that provides improved guest operating system
accounting.
This patch fixes a denial of service vulnerability that could be
triggered in a virtual machine by an unprivileged, locally
logged-on user in the virtual machine.
Virtual machines are affected under the following conditions:
- The virtual machine is running a Windows operating system.
- The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting driver is installed
in the virtual machine. Note that this is an optional (non-
default) part of the VMware Tools installation.
- The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting Service is not running
in the virtual machine
The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting Service is no longer provided
in newer versions of VMware Tools, starting with the versions
released in Fusion 2.0.2 and ESX 4.0.
However, virtual machines migrated from vulnerable releases will
still be vulnerable if the three conditions listed above are met,
until their tools are upgraded.
Steps needed to remediate this vulnerability:
Guest systems on VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion
- Install the new version of Workstation, Player, ACE, Server,
Fusion (see below for version information)
- Upgrade tools in the virtual machine (virtual machine users
will be prompted to upgrade).
Guest systems on ESX 3.5, ESXi 3.5, ESX 3.0.2, ESX 3.0.3
- Install the relevant patches (see below for patch identifiers)
- Manually upgrade tools in the virtual machine (virtual machine
users will not be prompted to upgrade). Note the VI Client will
not show the VMware tools is out of date in the summary tab.
Please see <http://tinyurl.com/27mpjo> page 80 for details.
Guests systems on ESX 4.0 and ESXi 4.0 that have been migrated from
ESX 3.5, ESXi 3.5, and ESX 3.0.x
- Install/upgrade the new tools in the virtual machine (virtual
machine users will be prompted to upgrade).
If the Descheduled Time Accounting driver was installed, the tools
upgrade will result in an updated driver for Workstation, Player,
ACE, Server, ESX 3.0.2, ESX 3.0.3, ESX 3.5, ESXi 3.5. For Fusion,
ESX 4.0, and ESXi 4.0 the tools upgrade will result in the removal
of the driver.
VMware would like to thank Nikita Tarakanov for reporting this
issue to us.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1805 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
(column 4) if a solution is available. See above for remediation

b. Updated libpng package for the ESX 2.5.5 Service Console

The libpng packages contain a library of functions for creating and
manipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.
A flaw was discovered in libpng that could result in libpng trying
to free() random memory if certain, unlikely error conditions
occurred. If a carefully-crafted PNG file was loaded by an
application linked against libpng, it could cause the application
to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.
A flaw was discovered in the way libpng handled PNG images
containing "unknown" chunks. If an application linked against libpng
attempted to process a malformed, unknown chunk in a malicious PNG
image, it could cause the application to crash.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-0040 and CVE-2008-1382 to these
issues.
The VMware version number of libpng after applying the update is
libpng-1.0.14-12.i386.rpm.

(column 4) if a solution is available.
