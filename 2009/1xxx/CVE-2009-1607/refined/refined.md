{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the lack of input sanitization when registering a user. The vulnerability lies in the fact that a user can inject malicious JavaScript code as part of their profile information.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "When an administrator visits the 'Users' menu in the admin panel, the injected JavaScript code is executed in their browser. This allows the attacker to redirect the admin to a malicious site, thus achieving cookie stealing.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker registers a user with malicious Javascript payload within the user information that will be triggered when an admin user views the user page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to register a user on the vulnerable application. The admin of the web application must visit the 'Users' menu for the attack to be successful."
