Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-1209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of the `defer` attribute within the `<script>` tag in Amaya 11.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability arises because the application fails to properly validate the length of input supplied to the `defer` attribute in the `<script>` tag, allowing an attacker to write beyond the boundaries of a stack buffer.
- **Unvalidated Input:** The application does not sanitize or check the size of data passed to the `defer` attribute, making it susceptible to the buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the overflow payload, attackers can overwrite critical parts of the stack, including the saved instruction pointer (EIP), and inject and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Denial of Service:** Even without successful code execution, a buffer overflow could crash the application, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious HTML file containing a long string within the `defer` attribute of the `<script>` tag.
- **HTML File:** The attacker hosts a malicious HTML file on a remote server, and the victim's Amaya browser must render the HTML file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Hosting:** The attacker must host a malicious HTML file on a web server.
- **Victim Interaction:** The victim needs to open the attacker's malicious HTML document with a vulnerable version of Amaya.
- **Knowledge of Stack Layout:** To achieve code execution, the attacker requires knowledge of the stack layout and the address of return instructions in the target software.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- **Exploitation Technique:** The exploit takes advantage of the stack overflow to overwrite the SEH (Structured Exception Handler) chain.
- **Shellcode:** The provided exploit code includes shellcode to launch the calculator application as a demonstration of arbitrary code execution. The exploit specifically uses a `pop pop ret` instruction to gain control.
- **Vulnerable Platform:** The exploit has been tested and verified to work on Windows XP SP2.
- **Specific exploit details:** The exploit code pads the buffer with "A" characters (0x41), overwrites the SEH with a crafted address, and includes a shellcode designed to execute "calc.exe"
