Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in the article about Linksys IP cameras, which seems related to CVE-2009-1560.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Disclosure of Credentials in Client-Side Source Code:** The web interface of the Linksys IP camera (WVC54GCA) returns sensitive information such as the admin password and Wi-Fi encryption keys directly in the HTML source code of specific pages.
*   **Multiple XSS vulnerabilities:** Input sanitization was not properly implemented, leading to stored XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission of Credentials:** The web interface returns the admin password and wireless encryption key in the HTML source code, and since the camera does not have SSL/TLS support, this information is transmitted in the clear, vulnerable to interception.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The web interface does not properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the pages via URL parameters, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Weak/Insufficient Filtering:** The filtering mechanism implemented by the developers is easily bypassed as the filtering was only for the `<script>` tags but not `<img>` tags for example.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Theft:** By exploiting the XSS vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the camera's web interface, allowing them to steal the admin password and/or Wi-Fi keys.
*   **Unauthorized Access/Control:** With stolen admin credentials, an attacker can gain full control of the camera.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to Camera Interface:** An attacker can directly exploit the credential disclosure by visiting the vulnerable URLs (e.g., `/adm/file.cgi?next_file=pass_wd.htm`, `/adm/file.cgi?next_file=Wsecurity.htm`) if they have network access to the camera.
*   **XSS Attack via Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code, which gets executed in the victim's browser when they visit the URL. This code can then steal credentials and send them to the attacker's server.
*   **Client-Side Attacks:** An attacker can use social engineering tactics to lure users to visit a page with a malicious URL, triggering the XSS attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the camera. This could be via the same local network as the camera or potentially through the internet if the camera is exposed.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript to craft the malicious XSS code.
*   **Social Engineering:** For the XSS attacks, the attacker may need to employ social engineering tactics to get a valid user to visit a malicious link while logged into the admin interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The article mentions that basic authentication is used by the camera, which transmits credentials in base64 encoding, but this is easily decoded. The vulnerability resides in the fact that credentials are included in the source code of the page.
*   The provided exploit code `evil.js` demonstrates how to steal the admin password using XSS, by sending it to a remote server.
*   The vulnerabilities were tested on the WVC54GCA with firmware versions V1.00R22 and V1.00R24.
