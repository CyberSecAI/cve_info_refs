Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1503:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `login.php` file of Tiger DMS. The application does not properly sanitize user input in the username and password fields before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is that the application directly incorporates user-supplied data from the `r_username` and `r_password` parameters into the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Authentication Bypass: The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited to bypass the authentication mechanism, allowing attackers to log in without valid credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application as any user.
- Potential Data Breach/Manipulation: If the bypassed user has higher privileges the impact could be a data breach, data modification, or privilege escalation within the Tiger DMS application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP Request: The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP request to the `login.php` page.
- Malicious Input: The malicious input is injected into the `username` and `password` fields within the login form of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Tiger DMS application.
- Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters: The attacker needs to know that the `username` and `password` parameters in `login.php` are vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Exploit:**

The provided exploit example involves setting both the username and password fields to `' or '1=1`. This results in the following SQL query being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users where username='' or '1=1' and password='' or '1=1'
```

Since `1=1` is always true, this query will return all users from the table, bypassing the authentication checks. The application then proceeds to log the attacker in as the first user retrieved.

**Additional notes:**
The exploit-db content provides more detailed information than the standard CVE description, including the specific vulnerable file (`login.php`), the vulnerable code snippet, and a working exploit example. This information is extremely useful in understanding the vulnerability.
