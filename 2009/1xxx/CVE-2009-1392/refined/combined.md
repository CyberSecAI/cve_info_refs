                 CVE-2009-1841

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications, such as the Iceweasel web
browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2009-1392

Several issues in the browser engine have been discovered, which can
result in the execution of arbitrary code. (MFSA 2009-24)

CVE-2009-1832

It is possible to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving "double
frame construction." (MFSA 2009-24)

CVE-2009-1833

Jesse Ruderman and Adam Hauner discovered a problem in the JavaScript
engine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
(MFSA 2009-24)

CVE-2009-1834

Pavel Cvrcek discovered a potential issue leading to a spoofing attack
on the location bar related to certain invalid unicode characters.
(MFSA 2009-25)

CVE-2009-1835

Gregory Fleischer discovered that it is possible to read arbitrary
cookies via a crafted HTML document. (MFSA 2009-26)

CVE-2009-1836

Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang and Ming Zhang reported a potential
man-in-the-middle attack, when using a proxy due to insufficient checks
on a certain proxy response. (MFSA 2009-27)

CVE-2009-1837

Jakob Balle and Carsten Eiram reported a race condition in the
NPObjWrapper_NewResolve function that can be used to execute arbitrary
code. (MFSA 2009-28)

CVE-2009-1838

moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary
JavaScript with chrome privileges due to an error in the
garbage-collection implementation. (MFSA 2009-29)

CVE-2009-1839

Adam Barth and Collin Jackson reported a potential privilege escalation
when loading a file::resource via the location bar. (MFSA 2009-30)

CVE-2009-1840

Wladimir Palant discovered that it is possible to bypass access
restrictions due to a lack of content policy check, when loading a
script file into a XUL document. (MFSA 2009-31)

CVE-2009-1841

moz_bug_r_a4 reported that it is possible for scripts from page content
to run with elevated privileges and thus potentially executing arbitrary
code with the object's chrome privileges. (MFSA 2009-32)

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.11-0lenny1.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

I see this on Linux too.
The basic problem is that we create an atom for a string and then destroy it, but when we destroy it, it doesn't get removed from the atom table since the key we use doesn't match the key we added it with.

This looks a lot like [bug 489041](/show_bug.cgi?id=489041 "VERIFIED FIXED - Atom table crash triggered by DOM mutation events and unicode surrogates").

We could probably set things up so this asserts when the problem happens by having an assertion about gAtomTable.entryCount decreasing by 1 across the PL\_DHashTableOperate in ~AtomImpl.

My guess would be that porting the fix for [bug 421576](/show_bug.cgi?id=421576 "VERIFIED FIXED - Unpaired surrogate handled wrongly (Acid3 #68)") will fix this.

Transplanting the fix for [bug 421576](/show_bug.cgi?id=421576 "VERIFIED FIXED - Unpaired surrogate handled wrongly (Acid3 #68)") fixes this and [bug 489041](/show_bug.cgi?id=489041 "VERIFIED FIXED - Atom table crash triggered by DOM mutation events and unicode surrogates").

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

(MFSA 2009-33)

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-0lenny1.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported mail client.

For the testing (squeeze) distribution these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Loading the testcase makes Firefox crash [@ nsHTMLEditor::HideResizers]. The immediate cause of the crash is that mTopLeftHandle is null.

Attached patch

[Patch v1](attachment.cgi?id=318282&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=318282&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=431086&attachment=318282)

When the testcase makes the document abspos and editable, it becomes resizable. It doesn't really make sense to have the document resizable, but regardless ShowResizers() is called from some editor batching stuff in the execCommand call. This fails, because it can't create resizer nodes which are direct descendants of the document element, but it leaves the mResizedObject field pointing to the document element. Later on when we tear down the editor, we call HideResizers(), which sees mResizedObject is !null, and so assumes that all the resizers exist, and dereferences one of them to delete it, causing the crash.
This patch:
\* Moves the implementation of ShowResizers() into an inner method, when it fails, the outer will call HideResizers() so that the mResizedObject field doesn't point to something that isn't acually able to be resized.
\* Fixes HideResizers() to be null safe.Assignee: nobody → chrisStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Patch v1
A little ugly, but it probably prevents a couple of crashes. I would also move up the call to GetParentNode in nsHTMLEditor::ShowResizers, (before any of the code that sets members) and return early if parentNode is null.

I was trying to roll this into the patch for [bug 399046](/show_bug.cgi?id=399046 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Resizers of centered tables are positioned wrongly in designmode"), but I haven't had the time to work out test-failure issues with that patch. That stack trace looks like it's from some other bug? This patch could land if you're worried about it.

m-c patch without test
May I carry forward approval for this patch? It's the previously approved patch, with the crashtest removed to prevent potential disclosure of an exploit.

Yes, get\_window\_for\_gtk\_widget() can return NULL in some circumstances, but I
don't think it should in this case. It does look like it has returned
something wrong, but I think this could be a symptom of a more complicated
problem.
All MozDrawingarea inner\_windows should have a parent MozContainer widget
(while the MozDrawingarea still exists at least), and all MozContainer widgets
should have an nsWindow (while the descendant nsWindow has a MozDrawingarea at
least).
Martin, thank you for the backtrace. Would you be able to print the values of
mDrawingarea->inner\_window, widget, and window, please? That might help
narrow down where the problem is.

Attached patch

[clear mozdrawingarea from GdkWindow and add asserts [checked-in]](attachment.cgi?id=335112&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=335112&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=451341&attachment=335112)

Correctly clear the "mozdrawingarea" from the data on the GdkWindows in case
something is grabbing a reference through nsWindow::GetNativeData() and then
using it as a parent to try to create a child nsWindow after the parent
nsWindow has been destroyed.
Add an assert to check that the MozContainer stored on MozDrawingarea's
GdkWindows remains valid through a reparent.
Add asserts that the parent MozContainer can be found and that it has an
nsWindow.
This is not likely to directly fix the problem, but will catch some possible
situations where the nsWindow and the embedding app won't interact well.Assignee: nobody → mozbugzStatus: UNCONFIRMED → ASSIGNEDEver confirmed: true

BTW, sometimes gdb seems to need "this->mDrawingarea->inner\_window".

I don't expect this to fix the problem reported here, but it might help us catch some possible causes.
I'll leave this bug open in the hope that we might find the real cause of the problem.

(In reply to [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=451341#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - xulrunner crashes when fails to find the window on which to change the cursor"))
> All MozDrawingarea inner\_windows should have a parent MozContainer widget
> (while the MozDrawingarea still exists at least)
It seems that we can get into a situation where the MozContainer widget is not
valid when an nsWindow of type eWindowType\_child is created with a native
GdkWindow parent (instead of an nsWindow parent), and the nsWindow
corresponding to the parent GdkWindow and MozContainer gets destroyed before
the new nsWindow of type eWindowType\_child.
The MozContainer for the new nsWindow's MozDrawingarea is obtained from the
parent GdkWindow, but the new nsWindow is not registered as a child of the
parent GdkWindow's nsWindow. If the new nsWindow were registered as a child
then it would be destroyed before the parent was destroyed, but, as it is not
registered, the parent nsWindow can be destroyed first, destroying the
MozContainer before the child nsWindow's MozDrawingarea, leaving a dangling
pointer to the MozContainer.
I haven't (yet) been able to determine why unconnected parent nsWindows are
destroyed before their indirect child nsWindows, but, if this situation cannot
be excluded, possible options for resolving include.
1) Register the new nsWindow as a child of the parent GdkWindow's nsWindow.
I don't know what assumptions are made about the nsIWidget hierarchy, and
so I'm not sure what effects this might have. Other platforms don't put
nsWindows into the hierarchy when created with a native parent.
2) Create a new MozContainer widget for the new nsWindow.
This seems a bit of a waste of MozContainer widgets.
When the parent GdkWindow is destroyed, the new nsWindow's GdkWindows are
also "destroy"ed (but not unref'ed), so adding a MozContainer doesn't
lengthen the functional life of the nsWindow. There is little gain from
having extra MozContainers.
3) Check whether the (child) GdkWindow is destroyed before using it to look up
the MozContainer.
This can be done by casting the GdkWindow\* to a struct GdkWindowObject\*
which has a "destroyed" field. We already do this in
nsWindow::SetupPluginPort, and the struct and casting macro are defined in
gdkwindow.h, but I don't see any documentation on GdkWindowObject.
4) Add weak reference callbacks to the MozContainer for each of its
MozDrawingareas, so the MozDrawingareas get notified when their
MozContainer is disposed.Depends on: [478519](/show_bug.cgi?id=478519 "RESOLVED FIXED - suppress painting when windows are not visible (obscured or minimized)")

Attached patch

[make the pointer from MozDrawingarea to MozContainer a weak reference](attachment.cgi?id=362840&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=362840&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=451341&attachment=362840)

This is option 4 from [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=451341#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - xulrunner crashes when fails to find the window on which to change the cursor"). I still need to make another patch adding
NULL checks in the places where these weak references are accessed.
The patch also removes MozDrawingarea::parent, which is not used, so that
there is no need to fix up dangling pointers there.
The toplevel nsWindow first gets destroyed on an event (when clicking the
frame's close box at least), then the eWindowType\_child nsWindows with weak
references to the MozContainer on the toplevel nsWindow get destroyed on
GC/shutdown.
toplevel nsWindow:

Attached patch

[NULL checks on MozContainer widget pointers v1.1](attachment.cgi?id=363049&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=363049&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=451341&attachment=363049)

The assertion in [attachment 363044](/attachment.cgi?id=363044 "NULL checks on MozContainer widget pointers") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=363044&action=edit "NULL checks on MozContainer widget pointers") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=363044&action=diff "NULL checks on MozContainer widget pointers") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=451341&attachment=363044) wasn't valid: OnButtonPressEvent collects events on the nsWindow associated with event's window, while GTK collects the event on the widget with the grab (and provides that widget). Given that the widget that GTK provides is different to the nsWindow's container widget, I'm not sure that the container widget still exists.

I think it would make sense to land these patches on 1.9.1.
I don't know exactly how we might get into the situation of dereferencing these dangling pointers, but better to be safe than sorry.

This is essentially all 3 patches here combined, but IMEComposeStart and IMEComposeText are a little different on 1.9.0.

The testcase in [bug 484458](/show_bug.cgi?id=484458 "VERIFIED FIXED - body onload=\"alert(1)\" crashes Firefox after reload") depends on the position of the pointer (and a modal dialog), so an automated test would either need to be based on some other scenario, which we do not yet know, or perhaps we could put the browser into fullscreen view, which would be likely to catch the pointer on systems with a single monitor.
[Attachment 362840](/attachment.cgi?id=362840 "make the pointer from MozDrawingarea to MozContainer a weak reference") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=362840&action=edit "make the pointer from MozDrawingarea to MozContainer a weak reference") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=362840&action=diff "make the pointer from MozDrawingarea to MozContainer a weak reference") and [attachment 363049](/attachment.cgi?id=363049 "NULL checks on MozContainer widget pointers v1.1") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=363049&action=edit "NULL checks on MozContainer widget pointers v1.1") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=363049&action=diff "NULL checks on MozContainer widget pointers v1.1") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=451341&attachment=363049) are tested on 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 through their use in code from [bug 298889](/show_bug.cgi?id=298889 "RESOLVED FIXED - iframe invisible when window is transparent"). (Mochitests would be crashing without these patches.)
1.9.0 doesn't have the code from [bug 298889](/show_bug.cgi?id=298889 "RESOLVED FIXED - iframe invisible when window is transparent"), so we don't have test coverage through that code, and we don't know of another testcase. We might be able to construct something with different cursor styles, but that would depend on the position of the pointer again.
I suspect the patches here also fix [bug 467744](/show_bug.cgi?id=467744 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - crash @gdk_window_new from moz_drawingarea_create_windows after GdkWindow 0x???????? unexpectedly destroyed"), as I haven't seen any "unexpectedly destroyed" messages since applying these patches, but I don't fully understand what's happening in that bug (and it doesn't have a reproducible testcase.

I don't know the changes between 1.8 and 1.9 well enough to know why the testcases in [bug 484458](/show_bug.cgi?id=484458 "VERIFIED FIXED - body onload=\"alert(1)\" crashes Firefox after reload") and [bug 474303](/show_bug.cgi?id=474303 "VERIFIED FIXED - leave_notify_event_cb() tries to AddRef already released window") do not crash 1.8. The widget structures are similar to 1.8, but perhaps the order of operations is different enough that no problems are hit.

I've verified [bug 484458](/show_bug.cgi?id=484458 "VERIFIED FIXED - body onload=\"alert(1)\" crashes Firefox after reload") but I cannot verify [bug 474303](/show_bug.cgi?id=474303 "VERIFIED FIXED - leave_notify_event_cb() tries to AddRef already released window") (the testcase isn't crashing). I'm not sure what else can be done to verify this fix at this time.

> I expect this change to GDK will also prevent this bug from happening:

I mean it would avoid [bug 484458](/show_bug.cgi?id=484458 "VERIFIED FIXED - body onload=\"alert(1)\" crashes Firefox after reload") and [bug 474303](/show_bug.cgi?id=474303 "VERIFIED FIXED - leave_notify_event_cb() tries to AddRef already released window").
It wouldn't fix all of potential problems fixed in this bug.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-24

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.0.11)

Announced
June 11, 2009
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.11
* SeaMonkey 1.1.17
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.22

### Description

Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed
several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of
memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with
enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out
the possibility that for some of these an attacker might be able to
prepare memory for exploitation through some means other than
JavaScript such as large images.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.

### References

Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, Alexander Sack, Bret McMillan, Tomeo
Vizoso, Matt McCutchen, and Martijn Wargers reported crashes in the
Firefox 3 browser engine. Boris Zbarsky also reported a method to
trigger double frame construction which could lead to memory
corruption.

[testcase (causes shutdown crash)](attachment.cgi?id=356114)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=356114&action=edit)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Load the testcase.
2. Quit Firefox.
Result: crash [@ UnhookTextRunFromFrames] or [@ ClearAllTextRunReferences]. If MallocScribble is enabled, the crash involves dereferencing 5555567d, but without MallocScribble, a random address gets called.

I can reproduce the ClearAllTextRunReferences shutdown-crash in my Linux mozilla-central debug build from this morning. OS --> All.
The crash is at line 328 in nsTextFrameThebes.cpp, on the call to aFrame->GetType(), quoted here:
328 NS\_ASSERTION(aFrame->GetType() == nsGkAtoms::textFrame,
329 "Bad frame");
If I run "print \*aFrame" in gdb after the crash, I see that all of aFrame's member-data pointers are bad (0x5a5a5a5a). firebot tells me that that pattern signifies "jemalloc allocated but unused memory (MALLOC\_FILL) - or possibly dead land (deleted memory)".
FWIW, I can't reproduce the shutdown-crash in today's optimized nightly build. (Or at least I can't tell that it's crashing -- Firefox closes normally, and I get no errors printed to stderr or stdout.)OS: Mac OS X → All

That assertion was added specifically to catch stale text frames here. Without the assertion, the code in that method will usually silently exit without causing any problems.

|  | |

"Usually" not causing problems isn't very reassuring! Actually, it looks like the crash can happen after merely closing the window, it's not just a shutdown thing. And in a release build, without the assertion, there's a risk that we'll be dereferencing something stale elsewhere in the function, so we're still liable to crash.
I'm suspicious that this may be a result of the fix to [bug 470418](/show_bug.cgi?id=470418 "VERIFIED FIXED - Leak nsStyleContext with RTL, text-transform"). That patch redefined the TEXT\_INCOMING\_ARABICCHAR flag to avoid conflicting with TEXT\_IN\_CACHE, which was most definitely a Bad Thing. However, it now conflicts with TEXT\_IN\_TEXTRUN\_USER\_DATA. :( This means that it may affect the behavior of nsContinuingTextFrame::Destroy(), at least: it looks like it could cause ClearTextRun() to be called in cases where otherwise it wouldn't have been. Could that be damaging things?
I haven't yet tested enough to confirm whether this is really the root of the problem, but it looks bad. Part of the trouble is that these flag bits are defined in a variety of places, so it's not immediately obvious if we're inadvertently reusing bits for multiple purposes.

"Usually not causing problems" is actually worse than "always causes problems", since it's harder to debug, which is why I added the assertion to ensure it "always causes problems" :-).
In gfxFont.h are the rules that are supposed to govern who owns what flags:
CACHE\_TEXT\_FLAGS = 0xF0000000,
USER\_TEXT\_FLAGS = 0x0FFF0000,
PLATFORM\_TEXT\_FLAGS = 0x0000F000,
TEXTRUN\_TEXT\_FLAGS = 0x00000FFF
> However, it now conflicts with TEXT\_IN\_TEXTRUN\_USER\_DATA.
No, because TEXT\_IN\_TEXTRUN\_USER\_DATA is a frame state bit, and TEXT\_INCOMING\_ARABICCHAR is a textrun flag bit.

no comments, but I'm wondering if people just don't know what to say since they might be in the middle of a shutdown.

Attached patch

[fix](attachment.cgi?id=360649&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=360649&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=472776&attachment=360649)

The problem was when we constructed a textrun for a frame that already has one. We set TEXT\_IN\_TEXTRUN\_USER\_DATA on to frame and then call ClearTextRun on it before we set its mTextRun. Because it already has a textrun, we clear out that textrun and also clear the TEXT\_IN\_TEXTRUN\_USER\_DATA flag we just set... The fix is simple, just set TEXT\_IN\_TEXTRUN\_USER\_DATA after the ClearTextRun call.

Attached patch

[fix for 1.9.0.x (fixed bitrot in crashtests.list)](attachment.cgi?id=375493&action=diff)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=472776&attachment=375493)

Here's the fix as landed on 1.9.0.x -- I just fixed the bitrot in crashtests.list.

Is this a debug only crash? I cannot crash with 1.9.0.10 on Ubuntu or OS X.

Yes, I believe it was debug-only on mozilla-central.
However, I'm not sure anyone's seen this crash in 1.9.0.10 debug builds. (I haven't -- see [bug 490410 comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=490410#c11 "VERIFIED FIXED - Another Crash on testcase from 489647 with accessibility enabled in [@nsTextFrame::ClearTextRun()]").) This bug's testcase may require some additional not-currently-backported-to-1.9.0.x code in order to crash.
In any case, though, we took this bug's patch to fix [bug 490410](/show_bug.cgi?id=490410 "VERIFIED FIXED - Another Crash on testcase from 489647 with accessibility enabled in [@nsTextFrame::ClearTextRun()]")'s testcase, not to fix this bug's testcase.

We have closed this bug a long time ago. I think it would be better to handle it in a new bug.

I'm seeing a null-dereference; I think that's because we've created a content tree where a particular node has no parent, although I don't completely follow what's going on.

If I breakpoint in the nsListBoxBodyFrame::OnContentRemoved call from that removeChild call, here's what the relevant part of the frametree looks like:

Note that the second and third nsGridRowLeaf frames have the same content node; in fact the node we're removing. So we remove one of them, and then have a frame in the tree which points to a content node whose parent is null. When we dereference that null later, we crash.

[Testcase not involving XBL](attachment.cgi?id=370251)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=370251&action=edit)

The only reason XBL was needed was to make sure that:
1) A frame reconstruct (and in particular a ContentInserted) happened
2) No frame was constructed for the content passed to
nsListBoxBodyFrame::OnContentInserted
This testcase just uses display:none on the listitem for similar effect. We call nsListBoxBodyFrame::OnContentInserted, which calls nsListBoxBodyFrame::CreateRows, which does the whole GetNextItemBox thing. Then GetNextItemBox calls CreatListBoxContent, which returns null. This triggers this lovely bit of code:
if (result) {
if (aCreated)
\*aCreated = PR\_TRUE;
} else
return GetNextItemBox(aBox, ++aOffset, aCreated);
which then tries to construct a frame for the next content... but we have a frame for it already.

I think this is the right thing to do; just skipping the create if GetPrimaryFrameFor() returns something different from mLinkupFrame might not work well if mRowsToPrepend > 0. But then again, I'm not quite sure exactly what this code should be doing when mRowsToPrepend > 0....

I didn't try the first test case, but the second test case crashes here; is that supposed to happen? Note that this is a debug build, so I'm assuming it's not doing any optimisation tricks that would result in a confusing stack.

Yes, the second testcase is expected to crash on that line (as does the first). parentContent is null, since prevContent is no longer in the document.

Downstream bug - <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=488570>
in nsViewManager::DispatchEvent() there's a code:
1130 vm->DoSetWindowDimensions(vm->mDelayedResize.width,
1131 vm->mDelayedResize.height);
1132 vm->mDelayedResize.SizeTo(NSCOORD\_NONE, NSCOORD\_NONE);
1133
1134 // Paint later.
1135 vm->UpdateView(vm->mRootView, NS\_VMREFRESH\_NO\_SYNC);
but vm (nsViewManager \*) can be destroyed in DoSetWindowDimensions() so
vm->UpdateView(vm->mRootView, NS\_VMREFRESH\_NO\_SYNC);
uses already freed object. (vm is a normal pointer here). In this particular case ViewManager is destroyed because of frame style change:

It would be better to hold the strong reference in HandleEvent --- having 'this' go away anywhere inside a method is bad news...

roc: Is [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=490425#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsViewManager::DispatchEvent]") an "r-" ? That is, is the ball in your court as reviewer or back to the assignee?

Since we're not seeing this (only 7 crash reports in 3.0.10, out of thousands) and there's no testcase to verify we're uncomfortable rushing this into 1.9.0.11 (code freeze less than a week away). But we'll take it if roc's happy with the patch.Assignee: nobody → stranskyFlags: blocking1.9.0.12?Flags: blocking1.9.0.11?Flags: blocking1.9.0.11-

It depends what happened in frame 0 which is missing there. Could be this one or something completely different.

Some STR at <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c66> but requires a "Clearspace" installation. We need something more reliable for verification, a testcase in the bug or even better one we could check in as a regression test.Keywords: [testcase-wanted](/buglist.cgi?keywords=testcase-wanted&resolution=---)

What is Clearspace? Is it something that uses a Java applet. Without a site or without a way to get "Clearspace" there is no way to get a testcase.

Clearspace (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearspace>) is ugly java blob, the crash occurs when web based document editor is loaded on a web page. (Generally when you select "Edit document" in Clearpace) I'll try to find some reproducer.

I made an account on wiki.jboss.org, which uses Clearspace, and used the editor with Firefox 3.0.10. I couldn't get a crash when I did so. Does anyone have any more specific steps for triggering this?

Some steps are at:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c66>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c67>

All right. I've been able to reproduce the crash using the steps at <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c66>. Unfortunately, using last night's 3.0.11pre build, it still crashes using these same steps.
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11pre) Gecko/2009051504 GranParadiso/3.0.11pre
So this bug does not appear to be fixed.

Huh, finally I manage to get the crash. It's here:
nsViewManager::DispatchEvent() at nsViewManager.cpp:
1078 // Paint later.
1079 vm->UpdateView(vm->mRootView, NS\_VMREFRESH\_NO\_SYNC);
1080 didResize = PR\_TRUE;
because vm->mRootView is NULL now so we crash at:
NS\_IMETHODIMP nsViewManager::UpdateView(nsIView \*aView, PRUint32 aUpdateFlags)
{
// Mark the entire view as damaged
nsView\* view = static\_cast<nsView\*>(aView);
nsRect bounds = view->GetBounds();
view->ConvertFromParentCoords(&bounds.x, &bounds.y);
return UpdateView(view, bounds, aUpdateFlags);
}

To be clear here, we need this patch in all branches.
Recently, vm->mRootView can be NULL and whole browser crashes then.

Ok, what/where do we still need a checkin here, this bug is resolved, the only active branches are our rapid-releases and 1.9.2... Was hoping to take care of this checkin-needed but not sure what needs doing.

So the aFrame passed in to nsNativeTheme::GetContentState has a mContent, but there's this chunk of code:
77 PRBool isXULCheckboxRadio =
78 (aWidgetType == NS\_THEME\_CHECKBOX ||
79 aWidgetType == NS\_THEME\_RADIO) &&
80 aFrame->GetContent()->IsNodeOfType(nsINode::eXUL);
81 if (isXULCheckboxRadio)
82 aFrame = aFrame->GetParent();
isXULCheckboxRadio is TRUE, so we grab the frame's parent. The frame's parent doesn't have mContent, and has a mRect of 0,0,65820,59880 (which I think is 2194x1996 pixels?) No idea what type it is.
We grab this parent frame for checkbox/radio in a few different places.
roc, any ideas as to what we should do here?

oof, it's the viewport. that makes sense I guess.
Where we do
if (isXULCheckboxRadio)
aFrame = aFrame->GetParent();
we should check that the new aFrame's content is non-null and bail if it is.

FYI for automated testing-- the above doesn't always crash immediately. Eg, I would use a file:/// URL and most of the time I would need to click 'Reload' to trigger the crash (though occasionally I wouldn't).

Since [bug 489647](/show_bug.cgi?id=489647 "VERIFIED FIXED - New 1.9.0.9 topcrash [@nsTextFrame::ClearTextRun()]") was blocking, if we can reproduce this, it should block too.Blocks: [CVE-2009-1313](/show_bug.cgi?id=489647 "VERIFIED FIXED - New 1.9.0.9 topcrash [@nsTextFrame::ClearTextRun()]")Flags: blocking1.9.0.11?

Just enabling accessibility is enough to get this crash, as was already said.

Daniel, the build id you posted wasn't from a 1.9.0.x build, but from a trunk build, so I guess you tested with a trunk build and not with a 1.9.0.x build.

Ah, good catch on that build ID... I'd swear I tested with a 1.9.0.x nightly on that machine, but maybe I forgot the "-no-remote" command-line arg or something.
In any case, I've downloaded a 1.9.0.x nightly on my laptop now, and I can definitely reproduce the bug here, both with the old bug's testcase (with accessibility enabled) and with Martijn's new automatic-accessibility-enabling testcase attached on this bug.

In theory, we should be able to hit this crash with a mozilla-central build/nightly from just after [bug 467150](/show_bug.cgi?id=467150 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsContinuingTextFrame::Destroy doesn't need to clear the textrun if the frame is empty")'s patch landed, and then track down a fix range from there, to see what patch fixed this additional crash.

Cool -- I tried the mozilla-central nightly build from 2008/12/17 (right after [bug 467150](/show_bug.cgi?id=467150 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsContinuingTextFrame::Destroy doesn't need to clear the textrun if the frame is empty") landed), and it crashed on this bug's testcase, after reloading repeatedly for ~10 sec.
I tried the 2008/12/20 nightly (a few days later) to make sure the 12/17 one wasn't just particularly crashy, and the 12/20 build crashed on this bug's testcase, too.
Sadly, the crash report doesn't seem to have symbols available.

I traced the crash to being fixed in mozilla-central between these nightlies:
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090223 Minefield/3.2a1pre
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090224 Minefield/3.2a1pre
That yields this regression range:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=b84ee6f45b08&tochange=69c86f3acc5a>
That range includes the fix for [bug 472776](/show_bug.cgi?id=472776 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ UnhookTextRunFromFrames] [@ ClearAllTextRunReferences] with bidi"), which I think is the exact same as this bug -- it's a crash [@ UnhookTextRunFromFrames] and [@ ClearAllTextRunReferences], which exactly matches the stacks I've been getting from Martijn's testcase here, e.g.
<http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/d005a5b3-613e-46ba-8fce-503602090428>
So, I think this crash here is effectively a dupe of [bug 472776](/show_bug.cgi?id=472776 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ UnhookTextRunFromFrames] [@ ClearAllTextRunReferences] with bidi").

The patch in [bug 472776](/show_bug.cgi?id=472776 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ UnhookTextRunFromFrames] [@ ClearAllTextRunReferences] with bidi") applies cleanly on 1.9.0.x (aside from 'crashtests.list') -- I tried it out, and it does indeed fix this crash.

(Though FWIW, I haven't ever been able to reproduce the shutdown crash from [bug 472776](/show_bug.cgi?id=472776 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ UnhookTextRunFromFrames] [@ ClearAllTextRunReferences] with bidi")'s testcase in a 1.9.0.x build. That's not a huge deal, though -- it just means there are additional factors involved that caused that particular testcase to fail on mozilla-central.)

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=484031#c0)• 16 years ago |
|  | |

Testcase is attached. You might need to download it locally due to bugzilla's attachment URI thing, but it'd work on any web server.
The basic idea is to have a binding with two insertion points; one of these needs to be an inline and the other needs to be a descendant of the inline's containing block. The we force a ContentAppended with at least two nodes after the binding has been attached (the testcase uses a script that blocks the parser and spins the event queue using sync XHR until the binding has been attached). The first node has block display and goes into the inline insertion point; the others go into the other insertion point.
Since there are multiple insertion points, the frame constructor converts the ContentAppended call into a sequence of ContentInserted calls. The first ContentInserted sticks a block inside the inline insertion point, which reframes the containing block. After that we already have frames for all the other kids, and their ContentInserted calls end up double-creating the frames. The testcase just uses a single doubled kid: a textnode that uses the text "Doubled", which shouldn't be crashy. But it could easily toss in iframes, image frames, etc, and cause various trouble.
Possible solutions I see:
1) Do a GetPrimaryFrameFor before doing ContentInserted in this case. That
would also bite fieldsets, since those claim multiple insertion points, but
might be ok.
2) If a node has a binding with multiple insertion points (including nested
ones, etc), never add more than one child at a time to it; notify after
each child.
#2 is hard to do with our current parser; not sure about Henri's parser. And in any case, we'd need it for both XHTML and HTML (the page could be HTML if it just linked to a separate XBL file).
Thoughts?

This doesn't trigger the doubling with Firefox 3 or my 1.9.0 build for some reason. I thought that had incremental XML parsing, and it certainly has the relevant frame construction code...
In any case, it does trigger doubling with 1.9.1 builds and trunk.

If the condition of #2 (node having a binding with multiple insertion points) expensive to find out on a per-insertion basis?
The relevant methods are the two methods starting here:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/users/mrbkap_mozilla.com/html5parsing/file/ad080d04a0e5/content/html/parser/src/nsHtml5TreeBuilderHSupplement.h#l86>
If would be a matter of the first calling the second conditionally. Thus, easy to do, but the effect depends on how expensive the check is.

Probably somewhat expensive, yes. I'm tempted to go with #1, since it's more reliable and guarantees that we only take a perf hit in the multiple insertion point case...

Probably, yes. Given what will happen if I stick an animated image in as the doubled node, the right rating is sg:critical.

Er, maybe not. That won't guarantee that we leak the frame, come to think of it. So we still need a rating, but we might be closer to ok than I thought, esp. with some of smaug's changes to subdocument frames.

[Fix](attachment.cgi?id=369742&action=diff) (obsolete)

Let's just fix this. I realized that the GetPrimaryFrameFor() check is cheap in the common case (the case when we don't double content), due to the MAY\_HAVE\_FRAME flag and due to this being ContentAppended for multiple nodes (so it's coming from the parser, basically, hence these nodes definitely should not have MAY\_HAVE\_FRAME set).

This should work unless the node's frame gets suppresed (e.g. whitespace inside a table row or some such). Not sure what we can do about that case, but "double-constructing" there should be safe enough in any case.

Is there any way to verify this fix for 1.9.0? As mentioned above, the attached testcase doesn't cause any issues with 1.9.0.10.

Probably, yes. Start with the attached testcase and modify it to trigger the relevant code on 1.9.0... That might involve some debugging to figure out why it doesn't right now. I didn't think that was worth it.

I'd be very very surprised if not. That said, I'm not sure nothing else along these lines does, so I'm not sure how worth it it is to fix it there.

Attached patch

[1.8 patch](attachment.cgi?id=383226&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=383226&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=484031&attachment=383226)

Updated patch for 1.8 although I can't confirm it fixes the bug on 1.8. The testcase acts the same way with and without the patch.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=503568#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-06-01 18:33:41 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, Alexander Sack, Bret McMillan, Tomeo Vizoso, Matt McCutchen, and Martijn Wargers reported crashes in the Firefox 3 browser engine.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=503568#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 22:46:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1095.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=503568#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 23:18:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1096 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1096.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=503568#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-06-16 02:17:37 UTC  ``` firefox-3.0.11-1.fc10, xulrunner-1.9.0.11-1.fc10, epiphany-2.24.3-7.fc10, epiphany-extensions-2.24.3-2.fc10, blam-1.8.5-11.fc10, devhelp-0.22-9.fc10, galeon-2.0.7-11.fc10, gecko-sharp2-0.13-9.fc10, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-31.fc10, gnome-web-photo-0.3-19.fc10, google-gadgets-0.10.5-7.fc10, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc10.3, Miro-2.0.3-5.fc10, mozvoikko-0.9.5-11.fc10, mugshot-1.2.2-10.fc10, pcmanx-gtk2-0.3.8-10.fc10, perl-Gtk2-MozEmbed-0.08-6.fc10.2, ruby-gnome2-0.18.1-5.fc10.3, yelp-2.24.0-10.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

This looks like the same crash as [bug 395651](/show_bug.cgi?id=395651 "RESOLVED FIXED - Atom table crash triggered by DOM mutation events and unicode surrogates") -- did we not actually fix it? Was it fixed and then something regressed it? (note this test is now checked into the testsuite -- [bug 395651 comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=395651#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Atom table crash triggered by DOM mutation events and unicode surrogates"))
Assigning to jst who fixed the old version. Feel free to farm it out, but with the test in the tree we're going to want a fix sooner than later.Assignee: nobody → jstFlags: wanted1.9.0.x+Keywords: [regressionwindow-wanted](/buglist.cgi?keywords=regressionwindow-wanted&resolution=---)Whiteboard: [sg:critical?]

Johnny, we really don't want to lose this for 1.9.0. Can you investigate for 1.9.0.12?

This was a regression from the branch port of [bug 439206](/show_bug.cgi?id=439206 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Shutdown crash [@ PL_DHashTableFinish] with high surrogate in <style>") (as, it seems, was [bug 490513](/show_bug.cgi?id=490513 "VERIFIED FIXED - Shutdown crash [@ PL_DHashTableFinish] with high surrogate in <style>")). If you look at the patch there, it clearly addressed an incompleteness of the patch for [bug 421576](/show_bug.cgi?id=421576 "VERIFIED FIXED - Unpaired surrogate handled wrongly (Acid3 #68)") -- which only landed on mozilla-central and was intentionally not backported to 190, introducing this [sg:critical?] bug. Oops. I filed [bug 497204](/show_bug.cgi?id=497204 "NEW - Reorganize and consolidate (without rewriting, as much as possible) XPCOM string encoding and decoding code") to reorganize and consolidate this code, because if four different people can write and review incorrect patches for this code (particularly security-critical code like encoding/decoding code), it clearly needs it.
Well, at least we picked up another point on Acid3 in this snafu (the original reason I investigated why the fix worked, incidentally).Keywords: [regression](/buglist.cgi?keywords=regression&resolution=---)

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A1096)

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
(CVE-2009-1392, CVE-2009-1833, CVE-2009-1838, CVE-2009-1841)

A flaw was found in the processing of malformed, local file content. If a
user loaded malicious, local content via the file:// URL, it was possible
for that content to access other local data. (CVE-2009-1835)

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c0)  Bret McMillan    2009-03-04 20:47:53 UTC  ``` We're seeing frequent crashes of various versions of firefox on RHEL 5 when used with the internal clearspace instance (docspace).  I will gdb backtraces and a coredump of 3.0.2 (the only one we could find debuginfo pkgs for), but we've experienced crashes on 3.0.6, and the 3.0.7 pkg I found in brew the other day.  We do not yet have a reliable reproducer, but it does seem to happen more when interacting w/ the the tinymce editor embedded within clearspace.  If you can point us towards more recent packages and/or debuginfo packages, we'll happily try to help come up w/ more relevant core dumps.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c1)  Bret McMillan    2009-03-04 20:50:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 334058](attachment.cgi?id=334058 "output of gdb's bt command") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=334058&action=edit "output of gdb's bt command") output of gdb's bt command  Stacktrace from gdb   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c2)  Bret McMillan    2009-03-04 20:51:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 334059](attachment.cgi?id=334059 "More verbose backtrace of all threads from gdb") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=334059&action=edit "More verbose backtrace of all threads from gdb") More verbose backtrace of all threads from gdb  Backtrace for all threads   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c4)  Martin Stransky    2009-03-04 21:33:59 UTC  ``` Please install debuginfo packages and attach the bactrace again...   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c7)  Bret McMillan    2009-03-09 16:51:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 334558](attachment.cgi?id=334558 "backtrace w/ more debuginfo's installed") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=334558&action=edit "backtrace w/ more debuginfo's installed") backtrace w/ more debuginfo's installed  Ok, here's the expanded backtrace w/ xulrunner and other debuginfo's installed   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c10)  Bret McMillan    2009-03-10 16:18:28 UTC  ``` Martin,  Go ahead and try creating a new document; also, Sudhir and I can probably help you via IRC if need be.  We hang out in #collaboration  TinyMCE refers to the javascript WYSIWYG editor invoked for any document (or other content) creation or editing.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c12)  Martin Stransky    2009-03-11 09:15:27 UTC  ``` I can't reproduce the crash.  But it looks like NULL pointer deference like <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=474303>. This one (and some others) are already fixed in upcoming 3.5 (former 3.1).   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c13)  Martin Stransky    2009-03-11 09:17:14 UTC  ``` If you can reproduce the crash - can you test official mozilla binaries too? latest 3.0.7 and 3.1 beta...   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c14)  Bret McMillan    2009-03-11 14:39:45 UTC  ``` Do we have 3.1 packages we could try w/ RHEL5?  Please note that we have tried the 3.0.7 packages that were found in brew, and reproduced the crash with them.  We couldn't provide a stack trace b/c we didn't have the debuginfo pkgs.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c15)  Lisa Webb    2009-03-11 17:49:32 UTC  ``` GSS is one of our biggest users of the internal Clearspace instance; this bug greatly impacts their ability to effectively perform their daily activities.   I see that you are having difficulty reproducing the problem (we also cannot reproduce it consistently)- is there anything further our team can do to help you troubleshoot this issue?   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c16)  Sam Knuth    2009-03-11 18:01:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c12)) > I can't reproduce the crash. >  > But it looks like NULL pointer deference like > <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=474303>.

And, do we know when this will be released?  Thanks, Sam   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c17)  Martin Stransky    2009-03-12 11:28:11 UTC  ``` Please install firefox 3.1b3 at your rhel-5 box (from ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/3.1b3-candidates/build2/linux-i686) and try to reproduce the problem with it. This build has the mentioned fix.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c18)  Bret McMillan    2009-03-12 18:21:59 UTC  ``` So far, haven't been able to reproduce the issue on the 3.1 build.  Any chance we can obtain some beta 3.1 packages for testing (and possible deployment) w/ RHEL 5 CSB?   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c22)  Sudhir Mallamprabhakara    2009-03-17 21:22:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 335605](attachment.cgi?id=335605 "output of gdb's bt command  Stacktrace from gdb") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=335605&action=edit "output of gdb's bt command  Stacktrace from gdb") output of gdb's bt command  Stacktrace from gdb    Experienced crash again on FF 3.0.7 with the patches applied.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c23)  Martin Stransky    2009-03-18 14:20:52 UTC  ``` Okay, new debug builds are available at <http://porkchop.devel.redhat.com/~stransky/xulrunner/> - please attach a backtrace from this build, it should provide more info...   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c24)  Sudhir Mallamprabhakara    2009-03-18 19:13:46 UTC  ``` My whole OS got rebooted after I installed the new debug builds and could not capture any stacktrace.

So we need a little bit more information on this:  1) The best thing which can happen to this bug would be if somebody *FROM GSS* in Brno would be able to reproduce this and then hand the computer to Martin or Jan. Could you try, please? 2) If not that could you try to reproduce it with firefox being started in safe mode, i.e., run  firefox -safe-mode  on in gnome-terminal. Could you do that? 3) Backtrace is still not complete, it could be useful, but still we could get better. Could you please (before doing any further testing) run (as root)  sed -i -e '/^enabled=/s/0/1/' /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel-debuginfo.repo yum install yum-utils debuginfo-install firefox  That should make much better backtraces.

For what it's worth:  I can consistently (100%) crash Firefox in Clearspace using the following set of specific steps. I only spent an hour or so on the issue, so I can't provide much analysis. However, when it naturally happens to me, I noticed that it was always happened when I was editing a previously created document with complex content in a second+ tab. I used this information to find the following sequence that will consistently crash (for me, at least).  There are two main parts that follow what I experience naturally: (1) creating the document and (2) editing the document. I have been able to get into a loop where the second sequence crashes again and again. I hope this provides some assistance; please let me know how else I can assist you in your efforts.  (prep sequence:) . Start firefox . Open new tab . Go to a space (e.g. <https://docspace.corp.redhat.com/clearspace/community/project/knowledge?view=overview>) . Open "Create a new document" in a new tab . Click Continue (Write a New Document) . Enter any name for the document like "test123" for the document . Switch to HTML . Paste attached HTML as the content . Click Publish . Quit Firefox & click "Save and Quit" (edit sequence:) . Start firefox (which should open two tabs from previous session) . Click OK to any authentication windows that pop up. . Click to focus on the second tab . Click on "Edit document" link *CRASH*   ```  [Comment 67](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c67)  Mike Amburn    2009-04-17 20:46:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 340086](attachment.cgi?id=340086 "HTML for the a sample document that crashes when editing") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=340086&action=edit "HTML for the a sample document that crashes when editing") HTML for the a sample document that crashes when editing   ```  [Comment 69](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c69)  Martin Stransky    2009-04-18 20:48:28 UTC  ``` I've found a way how reproduce it pretty reliably so you can take a break with the reproducers for now...   ```  [Comment 70](show_bug.cgi?id=488570#c70)  Sudhir Mallamprabhakara    2009-04-20 13:22:12 UTC  ``` Thanks Martin..

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[zipped up unminimized testcase](attachment.cgi?id=370500)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=370500&action=edit)

I have an unminimized testcase that crashes with this stacktrace. Unfortunately, it does crash not regurlarly, it can take up to 5 minutes to crash, which makes it really difficult to make a minimized testcase, so I'm giving up for now.
I've attached an zipped up unminimized testcase. Open the 'parentframe.htm' file to test. You might be more lucky to get the crash to open that file in multiple tabs.
It also crashes Firefox 3, so marking security sensitive for now.

I can't reproduce this on Linux, so the patch is based on the stack trace.
If the patch fixes this, this is probably a regression from
split-window.

I've run the testcase now half an hour with the tryserver build and I didn't get the crash, so I'm pretty sure the patch fixes the crash.

Hmm, I wonder if I should have updated IID after all.
The member variable is used in some inline methods.
For 1.9.0.x we may want to explicitly addref/release.Flags: blocking1.9.1?Flags: blocking1.9.0.10?

To fix this on stable branch (1.9.0), I can't change the member from
nsIDOMElement\* to nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMElement>, I think. There are few inline methods
which use the variable and I'm not sure how the automatic nsCOMPtr release would
work in case of nsPIDOMWindow destruction.
So, I think the caller of SetFrameElementInternal need to be responsible to
addref/release. That way we don't have to change the interface at all.
Patch coming once I've run all the tests.

Though, this wouldn't be any less-ugly solution.

Martijn, could you perhaps test the patch for 1.9.0?

|  | |

For what it's worth, nsCOMPtr<nsIFoo> and nsIFoo\* look the same on the machine level, I think, so the inline methods might have been ok. And nsPIDOMWindow's destructor is virtual, so doesn't get inlined. But I agree the other is safer.

I can't reproduce in my 1.9.0.x debug build, so I have to rebuild and then test in a non-debug build. I'll do that tomorrow.

Olli was so nice to post a tryserver build for this. I can verify that the 1.9.0.x patch seems to fix the crash for this. I let the testcase run in that build in 3 different tabs for one hour. It would have normally crashed for me.

Attached patch

[1.8 version](attachment.cgi?id=383225&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=383225&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=486398&attachment=383225)

Backported 1.8 version + modification for old gcc:
+ nsIDOMElement\* fe = frame\_element.get();
+ NS\_ADDREF(fe);
It's because the current patch doesn't compile on our ancient systems like RHEL-3/2.1.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=503570#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-06-01 18:38:49 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Jesse Ruderman, Adam Hauner, and Igor Bukanov reported crashes in the Firefox 3 JavaScript engine.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=503570#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 22:46:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1095.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=503570#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 23:18:11 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1096 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1096.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=503570#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-06-16 02:17:46 UTC  ``` firefox-3.0.11-1.fc10, xulrunner-1.9.0.11-1.fc10, epiphany-2.24.3-7.fc10, epiphany-extensions-2.24.3-2.fc10, blam-1.8.5-11.fc10, devhelp-0.22-9.fc10, galeon-2.0.7-11.fc10, gecko-sharp2-0.13-9.fc10, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-31.fc10, gnome-web-photo-0.3-19.fc10, google-gadgets-0.10.5-7.fc10, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc10.3, Miro-2.0.3-5.fc10, mozvoikko-0.9.5-11.fc10, mugshot-1.2.2-10.fc10, pcmanx-gtk2-0.3.8-10.fc10, perl-Gtk2-MozEmbed-0.08-6.fc10.2, ruby-gnome2-0.18.1-5.fc10.3, yelp-2.24.0-10.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2009-1392, CVE-2009-1832, CVE-2009-1833, CVE-2009-1837, CVE-2009-1838,
CVE-2009-1841)

Multiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed, local file
content. If a user loaded malicious, local content via the file:// URL, it
was possible for that content to access other local data. (CVE-2009-1835,
CVE-2009-1839)

A script, privilege elevation flaw was found in the way Firefox loaded XML
User Interface Language (XUL) scripts. Firefox and certain add-ons could
load malicious content when certain policy checks did not happen.
(CVE-2009-1840)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed certain Unicode characters in
International Domain Names (IDN). If an IDN contained invalid characters,
they may have been displayed as spaces, making it appear to the user that
they were visiting a trusted site. (CVE-2009-1834)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled error responses returned from
proxy servers. If an attacker is able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack
against a Firefox instance that is using a proxy server, they may be able
to steal sensitive information from the site the user is visiting.
(CVE-2009-1836)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 3.0.11. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this errata.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 3.0.11, which corrects these issues. After installing the
update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# USN-782-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

25 June 2009

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine of Thunderbird. If a

user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into viewing malicious web

content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-1303](/security/CVE-2009-1303), [CVE-2009-1305](/security/CVE-2009-1305), [CVE-2009-1392](/security/CVE-2009-1392), [CVE-2009-1833](/security/CVE-2009-1833),

[CVE-2009-1838](/security/CVE-2009-1838))

Several flaws were discovered in the way Thunderbird processed malformed

URI schemes. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website and

had JavaScript and plugins enabled, a remote attacker could execute

arbitrary JavaScript or steal private data. ([CVE-2009-1306](/security/CVE-2009-1306), [CVE-2009-1307](/security/CVE-2009-1307),

[CVE-2009-1309](/security/CVE-2009-1309))

Cefn Hoile discovered Thunderbird did not adequately protect against

embedded third-party stylesheets. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker

could exploit this to perform script injection attacks using XBL bindings.

([CVE-2009-1308](/security/CVE-2009-1308))

Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang, and Ming Zhang discovered that

Thunderbird did not properly handle error responses when connecting to a

proxy server. If a user had JavaScript enabled while using Thunderbird to

view websites and a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive

information. ([CVE-2009-1836](/security/CVE-2009-1836))

It was discovered that Thunderbird could be made to run scripts with

elevated privileges. If a user had JavaScript enabled while having

certain non-default add-ons installed and were tricked into viewing a

malicious website, an attacker could cause a chrome privileged object, such

as the browser sidebar, to run arbitrary code via interactions with the

attacker controlled website. ([CVE-2009-1841](/security/CVE-2009-1841))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=503569#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-06-01 18:37:02 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Boris Zbarsky reported a method to trigger double frame construction which could lead to memory corruption.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=503569#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 22:46:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1095.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=503569#c3)  Fedora Update System    2009-06-16 02:17:41 UTC  ``` firefox-3.0.11-1.fc10, xulrunner-1.9.0.11-1.fc10, epiphany-2.24.3-7.fc10, epiphany-extensions-2.24.3-2.fc10, blam-1.8.5-11.fc10, devhelp-0.22-9.fc10, galeon-2.0.7-11.fc10, gecko-sharp2-0.13-9.fc10, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-31.fc10, gnome-web-photo-0.3-19.fc10, google-gadgets-0.10.5-7.fc10, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc10.3, Miro-2.0.3-5.fc10, mozvoikko-0.9.5-11.fc10, mugshot-1.2.2-10.fc10, pcmanx-gtk2-0.3.8-10.fc10, perl-Gtk2-MozEmbed-0.08-6.fc10.2, ruby-gnome2-0.18.1-5.fc10.3, yelp-2.24.0-10.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

Attached file
[testcase (crashes Firefox when loaded)](attachment.cgi?id=316745)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=316745&action=edit)

Loading the testcase triggers:
###!!! ASSERTION: unexpected flow: 'mFrames.ContainsFrame(nextInFlow)', file /Users/jruderman/trunk/mozilla/layout/generic/nsInlineFrame.cpp, line 469
###!!! ASSERTION: StealFrame failure: 'NS\_SUCCEEDED(rv)', file /Users/jruderman/trunk/mozilla/layout/generic/nsContainerFrame.cpp, line 1116
Crash [@ IsPercentageAware].
Security-sensitive because the testcase is very similar to the testcase for [bug 429968](/show_bug.cgi?id=429968 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: child list is not empty for initial reflow\" with :first-letter, rtl").

This is the same issue as [bug 429968](/show_bug.cgi?id=429968 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: child list is not empty for initial reflow\" with :first-letter, rtl"), I think. We're violating assumptions that inline frames make in initial reflow, and that causes bad things to happen.Blocks: [429968](/show_bug.cgi?id=429968 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: child list is not empty for initial reflow\" with :first-letter, rtl")

This is definitely exploitable-looking on the 1.9.0 branch. If it's not crashing on mozilla-central ([comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=429969#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ IsPercentageAware] with :first-letter, rtl")) maybe we can backport the fix.

It doesn't crash on mac or windows with either builds, but running in debug I am seeing an assertion on both 1.9.1 and 1.9.2. However, on 1.9.1 the assertion is accompainied by a SQLLite warning, which I find odd. Everytime I reload the test on 1.9.1 I get the SQLLite warning. Here is what I get on 1.9.1 (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4pre) Gecko/20090417 Shiretoko/3.5b4pre):

I just filed [bug 491547](/show_bug.cgi?id=491547 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ IsPercentageAware] with first-letter float and direction: rtl"), which has a similar stacktrace, but seems like a regression. But perhaps still related to this?

I think it's more like [bug 460389](/show_bug.cgi?id=460389 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash [@ nsBlockFrame::DoRemoveFrame] with -moz-column, floating first letter, rtl")

The 1.9.0 patch in [bug 429968](/show_bug.cgi?id=429968 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: child list is not empty for initial reflow\" with :first-letter, rtl") fixes this crash on that branch. I still see the "unexpected flow" assertion, but no crash.

Checked [bug 429969](/show_bug.cgi?id=429969 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ IsPercentageAware] with :first-letter, rtl"), fixing this for the 1.9.0.11 release.
As far as the "sg:critical" crash goes this bug is now fixed, so I think the remaining assertion can go into another bug. There was [bug 402380](/show_bug.cgi?id=402380 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"ASSERTION: unexpected flow\" with :first-letter, :before, rtl, wrapping"), but that was fixed a while ago.Status: NEW → RESOLVEDClosed: 16 years agoKeywords: [fixed1.9.0.11](/buglist.cgi?keywords=fixed1.9.0.11&resolution=---)Resolution: --- → FIXED

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=503568#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-06-01 18:33:41 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, Alexander Sack, Bret McMillan, Tomeo Vizoso, Matt McCutchen, and Martijn Wargers reported crashes in the Firefox 3 browser engine.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=503568#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 22:46:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1095.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=503568#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 23:18:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1096 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1096.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=503568#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-06-16 02:17:37 UTC  ``` firefox-3.0.11-1.fc10, xulrunner-1.9.0.11-1.fc10, epiphany-2.24.3-7.fc10, epiphany-extensions-2.24.3-2.fc10, blam-1.8.5-11.fc10, devhelp-0.22-9.fc10, galeon-2.0.7-11.fc10, gecko-sharp2-0.13-9.fc10, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-31.fc10, gnome-web-photo-0.3-19.fc10, google-gadgets-0.10.5-7.fc10, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc10.3, Miro-2.0.3-5.fc10, mozvoikko-0.9.5-11.fc10, mugshot-1.2.2-10.fc10, pcmanx-gtk2-0.3.8-10.fc10, perl-Gtk2-MozEmbed-0.08-6.fc10.2, ruby-gnome2-0.18.1-5.fc10.3, yelp-2.24.0-10.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.
