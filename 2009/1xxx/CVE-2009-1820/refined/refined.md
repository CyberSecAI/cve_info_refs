Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1820:

**CVE Description:** The provided content does not include the official CVE description.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `product.php` script of the 2DayBiz Custom T-shirt Design application. This allows for both SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input being used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `id` parameter in `product.php` is directly used in a database query.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is also vulnerable to XSS, likely due to the `id` parameter not being properly sanitized before being displayed on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords of administrators. The example given extracts the username and password from the 'admin' table.
    - Modify data in the database.
    - Potentially gain access to the underlying server depending on the database privileges and configuration.
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker can:
   - Execute malicious scripts in the user's browser.
    - Steal cookies or session tokens, which could lead to account hijacking.
    - Redirect users to malicious sites.
   - Modify content of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Both SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities are exploited through the `id` parameter in the `product.php` script, using HTTP GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No special privileges or prior knowledge of the application is needed to carry out these attacks besides knowledge of the vulnerable URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit information indicates that the vulnerability was found in the 2DayBiz Custom T-shirt Design application.
- The provided exploit examples demonstrate how to exploit the SQL injection to extract admin credentials and how to inject a script for XSS.
- The SQL injection exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data, which means that the number of columns returned by the attacker's query must match the number of columns returned by the original query.
- The provided XSS payload is a simple alert that shows the user's cookies.

**Summary of Extracted Information**
This content provides detailed information about the SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities in the 2DayBiz Custom T-shirt Design application (CVE-2009-1820) including how to exploit it with clear examples, going beyond the basic description.
