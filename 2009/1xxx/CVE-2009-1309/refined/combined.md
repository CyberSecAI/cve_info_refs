Thanks to Tavis Ormandy who found the bugs.
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- java-1\_4\_2-ibm/IBMJava2
This update brings IBM Java 1.4.2 to Service Release 13.
It fixes lots of bugs and following security issues:
CVE-2008-3104: Security vulnerabilities in the Java
Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet that is
loaded from a remote system to circumvent network access
restrictions and establish socket connections to certain
services running on the local host, as if it were loaded
from the system that the applet is running on. This may
allow the untrusted remote applet the ability to exploit
any security vulnerabilities existing in the services it
has connected to.
CVE-2008-3112: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create arbitrary files with the
permissions of the user running the untrusted Java Web
Start application.
CVE-2008-3113: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create or delete arbitrary files with
the permissions of the user running the untrusted Java
Web Start application.
CVE-2008-3114: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to
determine the location of the Java Web Start cache.
CVE-2008-5350: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or
application to list the contents of the home directory of
the user running the applet or application.
CVE-2008-5346: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an
untrusted applet or application to read arbitrary memory
locations in the process that the applet or application is
running in.
CVE-2008-5343: A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java
Plug-in may allow hidden code on a host to make network
connections to that host and to hijack HTTP sessions using
cookies stored in the browser.
CVE-2008-5344: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with applet classloading may allow an
untrusted applet to read arbitrary files on a system that
the applet runs on and make network connections to hosts
other than the host it was loaded from.
CVE-2008-5359: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow
an untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges.
For example, an untrusted applet may grant itself
permissions to read and write local files or execute local
applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5339: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java Web Start
application to make network connections to hosts other than
the host that the application is downloaded from.
CVE-2008-5340: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with launching Java Web Start applications may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted application may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted application.
CVE-2008-5348: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with authenticating users through
Kerberos may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) to the
system as a whole, due to excessive consumption of
operating system resources.
CVE-2008-2086: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow
certain trusted operations to be performed, such as
modifying system properties.
CVE-2008-5345: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows
code loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost.
This may allow code that is maliciously placed on the local
filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network
access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed if
the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be
leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains
that map a name to the localhost).
CVE-2008-5351: The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8)
decoder in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts
encodings that are longer than the "shortest" form. This
behavior is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may
be leveraged to exploit systems running software that
relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form
sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be
decoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that
are not otherwise accessible to be read, if the URIs are
not checked following UTF-8 decoding.
CVE-2008-5360: The Java Runtime Environment creates
temporary files with insufficiently random names. This may
be leveraged to write JAR files which may then be loaded as
untrusted applets and Java Web Start applications to access
and provide services from localhost and hence steal cookies.
CVE-2008-5353: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects
may allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5356: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5354: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java
application that is launched through the command line to
escalate privileges. For example, the untrusted Java
application may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are
accessible to the user running the untrusted Java
application.
This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or
Java Web Start application.
CVE-2008-5357: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5342: A security vulnerability in the the Java Web
Start BasicService allows untrusted applications that are
downloaded from another system to request local files to be
displayed by the browser of the user running the untrusted
application.
Affected products: SUSE CORE 9, SLE 10
- kdegraphics3

CVE-2009-1181, CVE-2009-1182, CVE-2009-1183)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libopenssl-devel/openssl/compat-openssl097g
This update of openssl fixes the following problems:
- CVE-2009-0590: ASN1\_STRING\_print\_ex() function allows remote denial
of service
- CVE-2009-0591: CMS\_verify() function allows signatures to look valid
- CVE-2009-0789: denial of service due to malformed ASN.1 structures
Affected products: SLES 9, SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libsoup
Large strings could lead to a heap overflow in the base64 encoding and
decoding functions. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0585).
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, POS 9, OES, SLES 9, SLE 10
- opensc/libopensc2
Private data objects on smartcards initialized with OpenSC could be
accessed without authentication (CVE-2009-0368).
Only blank cards initialized with OpenSC are affected by this
problem. Affected cards need to be manually fixed, updating the
opensc package alone is not sufficient!
Please carefully read and follow the instructions on the following
web site if you are using PIN protected private data objects on
smart cards other than Oberthur, and you have initialized those
cards using OpenSC:
<http://en.opensuse.org/Smart_Cards/Advisories>
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- python-crypto
Missing checks for the key length in the ARC2 module potentially allowed
attackers to crash applications using python-crypto or potentially even
cause execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0544).
Affected products: SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- unbound
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow in the
ldns\_rr\_new\_frm\_str\_internal()
function. This allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
DNS resource record (RR) with a long class field and possibly TTL field.
(CVE-2009-1086)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could lead to crashes, make the viewer
run into an infinite loop or potentially even allow execution of
arbitrary code.

- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

# USN-782-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

25 June 2009

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine of Thunderbird. If a

user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into viewing malicious web

content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-1303](/security/CVE-2009-1303), [CVE-2009-1305](/security/CVE-2009-1305), [CVE-2009-1392](/security/CVE-2009-1392), [CVE-2009-1833](/security/CVE-2009-1833),

[CVE-2009-1838](/security/CVE-2009-1838))

Several flaws were discovered in the way Thunderbird processed malformed

URI schemes. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website and

had JavaScript and plugins enabled, a remote attacker could execute

arbitrary JavaScript or steal private data. ([CVE-2009-1306](/security/CVE-2009-1306), [CVE-2009-1307](/security/CVE-2009-1307),

[CVE-2009-1309](/security/CVE-2009-1309))

Cefn Hoile discovered Thunderbird did not adequately protect against

embedded third-party stylesheets. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker

could exploit this to perform script injection attacks using XBL bindings.

([CVE-2009-1308](/security/CVE-2009-1308))

Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang, and Ming Zhang discovered that

Thunderbird did not properly handle error responses when connecting to a

proxy server. If a user had JavaScript enabled while using Thunderbird to

view websites and a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive

information. ([CVE-2009-1836](/security/CVE-2009-1836))

It was discovered that Thunderbird could be made to run scripts with

elevated privileges. If a user had JavaScript enabled while having

certain non-default add-ons installed and were tricked into viewing a

malicious website, an attacker could cause a chrome privileged object, such

as the browser sidebar, to run arbitrary code via interactions with the

attacker controlled website. ([CVE-2009-1841](/security/CVE-2009-1841))

|  | |

This is a similar problem to [bug 370127](/show_bug.cgi?id=370127 "VERIFIED FIXED - XPCNativeWrapper function wrapper's __proto__ comes from content"). If chrome code calls
content.toString.call(), then content-defined functions can be called by chrome
code. Also, it's possible to use this bug to bypass XOW and perform bug
369334's XSS attack.

this patch fixes both testcases on 1.8; avoided not exported js\_SetSlotThreadSafe by using (funobj)->slots[JSSLOT\_PARENT] directly. Hope thats the right approach.

I don't think the code comment is necessary, and get rid of the space before the paren (not that it matters, it's your branch!).

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.9.0.9-0lenny2.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=482206#c0)• 16 years ago |
|  | |

This seems to be a regression from [bug 445004](/show_bug.cgi?id=445004 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Plugins embedded in generated file:// loaded pages don't appear and don't play."). fx3.0.7 and fx3.1 are affected.
On trunk, this seems to have been fixed by [bug 465806](/show_bug.cgi?id=465806 "RESOLVED FIXED - document.open should use the principal of the document whose URI it uses").
In nsHTMLDocument::OpenCommon(), we get the URI from the document returned by
GetDocumentFromContext(), but we get the principal by using
GetSubjectPrincipal().
An attacker can create a fake login page whose URI is a real login page's URI.
And, if a password for the real login page was already saved in the Password
Manager, an attacker can steal the password without user interaction.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=366276&action=edit)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Load a testcase.
2. Wait a few second.
A fake login page whose URI is
<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/users/login> appears.
And, if you already saved a password for
<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/users/login> then the Password Manager
will automatically fill in the password.

Hmm. So I'd be fine with backporting [bug 465806](/show_bug.cgi?id=465806 "RESOLVED FIXED - document.open should use the principal of the document whose URI it uses") (and maybe adding a hack of some sort for system principals so as not to break extension compat). jst, sicking, what do you think?
I guess the key to the testcase is that during execution of the function a() we actually change the principal and URI of the document whose context the function is running on. So the function has the old principals (which are still same-origin with the parent page) while the URI of the subframe is now a different URI, as is its principal. Is that correct?
I wish password manager didn't just rely on the URI; there are all sorts of ways the URI can be weird with document.write, especially once we implement the HTML5-specced behavior for the URI of document.write result pages.

What would it use instead?
If a page is able to bypass same-origin restrictions to reach into other content, it seems like that's the root problem that would lead to all kinds of other issues (say, stealing login cookies).

> What would it use instead?
The principal. That's what identifies what the page actually "is". For example, for a data: URI it would have the actual originating URI. That sort of thing. It's probably a good idea to cross-check the two in the password manager case, really...
> If a page is able to bypass same-origin restrictions to reach into other
> content
All the script running in this case is script with the origin of the original outer document. You did read the testcase, right? There are no same-origin restrictions being bypassed.

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=482206&attachment=366467)

This is basically the backport I described in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=482206#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FIX]It's possible to create a document whose URI does not match the document's principal"), with a test that's based on the testcase in this bug but sufficiently different to hopefully make it unclear what the danger is... I'd like to check in that same testcase to mozilla-central as well. moz\_bug\_r, is that reasonable?
I've tested this on 1.9.1; waiting on my 1.9.0 builds.

I don't think your testcase is sufficiently different. If someone runs your
testcase in browser, he/she can realize that the URI in the location bar is the
cross-origin page's URI while content is "Something". That is a real exploit
code, I guess.

Hmm. I could obfuscate it a bit more by running the test in a subframe so that the URI is not obvious. Would that help?
I can avoid pushing the test, but it seems a shame to have to do that. :(

The "Proposed fix" patch applies directly to 1.9.0 and fixes the bug there too.

Once this bug is made public, attackers understand what they can do with this
bug. So, even if the testcase in [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=482206#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FIX]It's possible to create a document whose URI does not match the document's principal") is still private, they can easily
create a password stealing page based on your testcase. Hmm, am I worrying
more than necessary?

Once the bug is made public, I'm checking in the testcase no matter what, assuming I still remember to. At that point we will have shipped fixes on all branches for the bug, right?

|  | |

Ah, checking in after shipping fixes is OK, indeed.
I'm not sure whether running the test in a subframe is helpful, if you check in
the testcase before shipping fixes.

OK. I'll do the usual "wait till we ship" thing, I guess. I hate that. :(

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-19

## Same-origin violations in XMLHttpRequest and XPCNativeWrapper.toString

Announced
April 21, 2009
Reporter
moz\_bug\_r\_a4
Impact
High
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.9

### Description

Mozilla security researcher **moz\_bug\_r\_a4** reported
that it is possible to create a document whose URI does not match the
document's principal using `XMLHttpRequest`. This type of
mismatch leads to incorrect results in principal-based security
checks. An attacker could use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
JavaScript within the context of another site.

moz\_bug\_r\_a4 separately reported
that `XPCNativeWrapper.toString`'s
`__proto__` comes from the wrong scope which results in
calls to that function being executed in the wrong context in certain
circumstances. An attacker could use this vulnerability to run
arbitrary code within the context of a different site. Alternatively,
if chrome were to call `content.toString.call()`, then
attacker-defined functions could be run with chrome privileges.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
(CVE-2009-1303, CVE-2009-1305)

Several flaws were found in the way malformed web content was processed. A
web page containing malicious content could execute arbitrary JavaScript in
the context of the site, possibly presenting misleading data to a user, or
stealing sensitive information such as login credentials. (CVE-2009-0652,
CVE-2009-1306, CVE-2009-1307, CVE-2009-1309, CVE-2009-1312)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey saved certain web pages to a local
file. If a user saved the inner frame of a web page containing POST data,
the POST data could be revealed to the inner frame, possibly surrendering
sensitive information such as login credentials. (CVE-2009-1311)

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
the changes to take effect.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
