Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Windows kernel's improper validation of input passed from user mode to the kernel when editing a specific desktop parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is that the Windows kernel does not adequately validate the data received from user mode before processing it when modifying a specific desktop parameter. This lack of validation allows for the potential injection of malicious data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   **Complete System Control:** An attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.
*   **Malicious Actions:**  This control enables the attacker to:
    *   Install programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker would need to run a specially crafted application that takes advantage of the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker needs legitimate user credentials.
*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must be able to log on to the target system directly (not remote or anonymous).
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to execute the crafted application on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is categorized as an "elevation of privilege" issue.
*   The provided Microsoft document specifically mentions that a fix for this vulnerability involves correcting the method used to validate input from user mode when setting the specific desktop parameter.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed and had proof of concept code published, but there were no reports of active exploitation at the time of the security bulletin's release.
*   This vulnerability is part of a set of four vulnerabilities addressed in the MS09-025 bulletin.
