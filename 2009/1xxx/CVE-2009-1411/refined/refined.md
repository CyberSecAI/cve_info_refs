Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1411:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an SQL injection in the 'c' parameter of the Seditio CMS Events Plugin

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the `c` parameter, allowing the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL execution: Attackers can potentially manipulate the database, gaining access to sensitive information, modifying data, or potentially taking full control of the application's database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: A malicious SQL payload is included within the 'c' parameter of an HTTP GET request targeting the `plug.php` script with `e=events&f=old`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have a basic understanding of SQL syntax. They do not need any special privileges or to be within the local network.

**More details:**

-   The exploit is in the `plug.php` file of the `events` plugin with `f=old` using parameter `c`
-   A sample vulnerable URL is given as `http://[site]/[path]/plug.php?e=events&f=old&c=all' [SQL]/*`
-   A proof of concept URL is provided `http://thespider.neocrome.org/plug.php?e=events&f=old&c=all' union select 1,2,3,4,5,version(),7,8,9,0,1,2,3/*` which tries to dump the database version
