Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect order of checks and cleanup within the `charon` daemon when processing IKEv2 packets. Specifically, the code attempts to destroy traffic selector lists (TSi and TSr) but does so in the wrong order. If either TSi or TSr is missing (NULL), the code attempts to dereference a NULL pointer, leading to a crash. The root cause is a logic error in the `destroy` function of the `child_create.c` file, where the null pointer checks for `tsi` and `tsr` were swapped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is a NULL pointer dereference due to the swapped conditional checks. The code attempts to access members of the TSi/TSr structures without properly verifying that these structures actually exist.
- **Improper Resource Management:** The incorrect cleanup logic leads to the crash. The code should first check if a pointer is valid (not NULL) before attempting to use it for destruction/cleanup operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. A remote attacker can send crafted IKEv2 packets that lack the TSi or TSr traffic selector payloads, causing the `charon` daemon to crash. This crash disrupts VPN connections and prevents new ones from being established until the daemon is restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely. The attacker needs to send malformed IKEv2 packets to a vulnerable strongSwan server.
- **Specifically Crafted IKEv2 Packets:** The attack involves sending an `IKE_AUTH` request that is missing either the TSi or TSr traffic selector payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target strongSwan server.
- **Ability to Send IKEv2 Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to construct and send IKEv2 packets.
- **No Authentication Required:** This is a pre-authentication vulnerability, meaning the attacker does not need valid credentials to trigger the crash.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability specifically affects strongSwan versions 4.1.0 to 4.3.0
- The fix involves correcting the order of checks when destroying traffic selector lists in the `child_create.c` file
- This issue is specific to IKEv2 implementations in `charon` daemon and does not affect the old stable distribution (etch) which lacks IKEv2 support.
