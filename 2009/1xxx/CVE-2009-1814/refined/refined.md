Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1814:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the `mail.php` script of PHPenpals version 1.1 and earlier. The script is vulnerable because user-supplied input via the `ID` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `ID` parameter in `mail.php`, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to sanitize user-provided data before using it in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Leakage:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as administrator usernames and password hashes using `UNION SELECT` statements.
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** Using the `load_file()` SQL function, the attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the web application and the server it runs on.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `mail.php`, including the malicious SQL injection payload in the `ID` parameter.
*   **Direct URL manipulation:** The attacker can craft malicious SQL queries within the vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web application to send the malicious HTTP GET request.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
