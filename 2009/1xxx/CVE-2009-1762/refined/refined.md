Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1762, based on the Novell knowledge base article.

**Vulnerability Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization or validation in Novell GroupWise WebAccess, allowing an attacker to inject and execute JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is an XSS vulnerability that allows JavaScript injection on the login page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can deface the login page, potentially preventing users from logging into WebAccess, effectively causing a denial of service. The content also suggests this could potentially be used for phishing or other attacks if the malicious code were more advanced than just defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Injection:** The attack vector is through the WebAccess login page. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by exploiting the lack of input validation in this page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the GroupWise WebAccess interface.
- **Injection Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to inject javascript into the login page, which likely means they need to find a parameter/field/location that doesn't properly sanitize inputs.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects GroupWise WebAccess versions 7.0 up to (and including) 7.03 HP2, and 8.0 up to (and including) 8.0.0 HP1
- It was discovered and reported by Scott White of Secure State, LLC.
