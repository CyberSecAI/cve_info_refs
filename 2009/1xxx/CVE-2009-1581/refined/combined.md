Package        : squirrelmail
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1578 CVE-2009-1579 CVE-2009-1580 CVE-2009-1581
Debian Bug     : 528528

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in SquirrelMail,
a webmail application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-1578

    Cross site scripting was possible through a number of pages which
    allowed an attacker to steal sensitive session data.

CVE-2009-1579

    Code injection was possible when SquirrelMail was configured to
    use the map_yp_alias function to authenticate users. This is not
    the default.

CVE-2009-1580

    It was possible to hijack an active user session by planting a
    specially crafted cookie into the user's browser.

CVE-2009-1581

    Specially crafted HTML emails could use the CSS positioning feature
    to place email content over the SquirrelMail user interface, allowing
    for phishing.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.9a-4.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.15-4+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.18-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
