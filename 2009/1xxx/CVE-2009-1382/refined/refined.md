Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2009-1382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `mimetex.cgi` application's improper handling of TeX expressions, specifically due to the use of `strcpy` without bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Stack-based buffer overflows:** Several stack-based buffer overflows exist in `mimetex.cgi`. These are triggered by oversized TeX expressions provided as input.
2.  **Unsafe directives:** The `\environ`, `\input`, and `\counter` directives are deemed unsafe for exposure to untrusted internet input, as they can lead to command injection if not properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Information Disclosure:** Although not explicitly detailed in the impact, the potential for information disclosure is mentioned alongside arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerabilities are triggered by sending crafted TeX expressions to `mimetex.cgi` via HTTP requests, often through a web browser.
- The vulnerable code is in the `rastpicture()` function, where a TeX expression is copied using `strcpy` into a buffer without checking its size.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Attackers must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable `mimetex.cgi` application.
- No authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**

-  The vulnerability is triggered with the following TeX expressions:
    ```
    ./mimetex.cgi "\picture(12,34){(AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA$10,10){testing}}"

    ./mimetex.cgi "\circle(10;`perl -e 'print "A"x400'`)"

    ./mimetex.cgi "\input[`perl -e 'print "A"x2000'`]{mimetex.cgi}"
    ```

- The `strcpy` function is used to copy data into a fixed-size buffer, `pream`, which leads to a buffer overflow if the source string `putexpr` exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- The  `\environ`, `\input`, and `\counter` directives were identified as a potential source for command injection, and were disabled in the updated version.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was found by Google's security team, specifically Chris Evans.
- Patches were released on the maintainer's website to address the issues.
- The oCERT advisory also notes the lack of version numbers, complicating the identification of affected software.
- The `mathtex` application is also mentioned as being vulnerable but it is associated with CVE-2009-1383.
