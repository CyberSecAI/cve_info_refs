  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1936",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of the `$prefix` variable within the `_functions.php` file, specifically line 36 where `require_once(\"{$prefix}_config.php\");` is used. The application does not properly sanitize or restrict the value of the `$prefix` variable, allowing an attacker to control the included file path.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Arbitrary File Inclusion",
        "Lack of input sanitization",
        "Uncontrolled variable in include function"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local or remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if a PHP file is included, information disclosure if sensitive files are included, or denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `_functions.php`. The attacker manipulates the `GLOBALS[prefix]` parameter to specify the file to be included.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
