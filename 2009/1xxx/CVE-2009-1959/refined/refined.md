Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-1959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `event_wallops()` function of the irssi IRC client. This function processes `WALLOPS` messages from IRC servers. The code attempts to remove a leading `0x01` character from the message using a null byte replacement. However, it doesn't properly check if the message has at least one character before attempting this replacement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Off-by-one Error:** If a `WALLOPS` message with a length of zero is received after the "01ACTION " prefix is removed, the code attempts to access `tmp[len-1]` where `len` is zero, leading to accessing `tmp[-1]`, and then writing to it which causes a heap-based buffer underflow.
*  **Out-of-bounds Read:** When the message length is zero, accessing `tmp[len-1]` results in an out-of-bounds read.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Underflow:** The out-of-bounds write operation with `tmp[len-1] = '\0'` can cause a heap-based buffer underflow by writing a null byte before the allocated buffer, corrupting heap metadata.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service. By sending a crafted `WALLOPS` message, an attacker can crash the irssi client.
*   **Potential for more severe issues:** The heap-based buffer underflow could potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, but the provided documents do not describe the specifics on how this would be achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker who has the ability to send specially crafted `WALLOPS` messages to an irssi client connected to an IRC server under their control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **IRC Operator Privileges:** The attacker needs operator privileges on an IRC server. This is required to send `WALLOPS` messages.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send messages to the vulnerable irssi client, meaning the client needs to be connected to a network controlled by the attacker.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and be able to craft a message that triggers the out-of-bounds read/write condition.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided patch checks if `len >= 1` before attempting to access `tmp[len-1]`, which prevents the out-of-bounds access, thus fixing the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is described as "easy to spot but difficult to exploit", primarily due to the challenges of achieving reliable heap-based off-by-one exploitation remotely.
* The SUSE security report indicates that the affected products are openSUSE 10.3-11.1
* Ubuntu's security notice mentions that this issue was addressed in the irssi package and provides the affected versions: 9.04, 8.10, 8.04 and 6.06.

In summary, CVE-2009-1959 describes a remotely exploitable off-by-one vulnerability in irssi's `event_wallops()` function, which could be used to crash the client.
