      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1558",
      "is_related": true,
      "details": "Two directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in the `/adm/file.cgi` program of Linksys IP cameras. The first vulnerability is due to insufficient filtering of the `next_file` parameter, while the second is due to the lack of filtering of the `this_file` parameter. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker with administrative access to retrieve arbitrary files from the device.",
      "vulnerability": "Directory Traversal",
      "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation of the `next_file` and `this_file` parameters within the `/adm/file.cgi` CGI program.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
         "Path Traversal"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary file retrieval, disclosure of sensitive information, such as password hashes and configuration settings.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET requests to the `/adm/file.cgi` endpoint, manipulating the `next_file` or `this_file` parameters."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "Administrative access to the camera's web interface is required to exploit these vulnerabilities."
