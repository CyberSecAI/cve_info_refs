{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1948",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `UnbDbEncode` function within `/unb_lib/database.lib.php`. When the `$forLIKE` parameter is set to `true`, the function incorrectly escapes characters, leading to a bypass of SQL injection sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input",
        "SQL Injection vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information, unauthorized data modification, or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered through the `$_REQUEST['Query']` parameter in `/unb_lib/search.inc.php` when the `InSubject` or `InMessage` parameters are enabled."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the parameters in the request.",
       "additional_notes": "The provided exploit code demonstrates how to leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information, such as usernames and password hashes, and subsequently use the retrieved information to authenticate as a legitimate user."
    },
    {
      "cve_id":"CVE-2009-1947",
         "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the ability to define global variables using the GLOBALS array and passing them in the query string, combined with a flawed logic in how the 'type' parameter is handled in `/unb_lib/rss.inc.php` and `useCached` function in `/unb_lib/feedcreator.lib.php`, allowing arbitrary local file disclosure.",
          "weaknesses":[
               "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input",
                "Local File Disclosure"
             ],
          "impact": "An attacker can disclose arbitrary local files from the server. Log files are a particular target.",
          "attack_vectors":[
                 "By manipulating the type parameter in the rss.inc.php request and defining a filename using the GLOBALS array, and exploiting the flawed logic in useCached."
             ],
         "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the parameters in the request. The `register_globals` PHP setting needs to be enabled.",
        "additional_notes": "The exploit code provides a proof-of-concept showing how to use this vulnerability to disclose log files."

     },
    {
     "cve_id":"CVE-2009-1949",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper initialization of the `$UTE` array and the use of a null byte in the filename path, combined with the inclusion of the file in the `UteShow` function in `/unb_lib/ute.runtime.lib.php`, which allows local file inclusion. Additionally, this vulnerability can lead to Remote Command Execution.",
       "weaknesses": [
             "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input",
             "Local File Inclusion",
             "Remote Command Execution"
          ],
      "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files leading to information disclosure or, by including a file with malicious PHP code, to remote command execution.",
       "attack_vectors":[
              "The attacker needs to manipulate the GLOBALS array by passing parameters in the request. The vulnerable code is in `UteShow` function in `/unb_lib/ute.runtime.lib.php`."
         ],
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, manipulate the parameters in the request and the PHP settings `register_globals` to `on` and `magic_quotes_gpc` to `off` .",
     "additional_notes":"The exploit code provides a proof-of-concept showing how to include `/etc/passwd` and describes how the attacker can obtain remote command execution by injecting PHP code in a log file or in an attachment/avatar and then including it via LFI."
