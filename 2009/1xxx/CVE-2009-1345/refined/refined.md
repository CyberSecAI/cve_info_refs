Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection flaw present in the `document.php` file of the CPCommerce 1.2.8 application. The `id_document` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation or sanitization of the `id_document` parameter in the `document.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject SQL queries. It is a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker doesn't see the direct output of the query, but can infer results based on application behavior.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially:
    *   Extract sensitive database information.
    *   Modify or delete data in the database.
    *   Potentially gain control over the server, depending on the database permissions and configuration.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes malicious SQL code in the `id_document` parameter of the `document.php` script. Specifically, the `id_document` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable CPCommerce application. They also need knowledge of SQL syntax to exploit the injection. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the server or application.

The provided exploit demonstrates how to test the blind SQL injection by using `substring` and `@@version` to determine the database version, indicating the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
