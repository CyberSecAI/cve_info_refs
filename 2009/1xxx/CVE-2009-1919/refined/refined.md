  "cve": "CVE-2009-1919",
  "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer accesses an object that has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",

      "vulnerability": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page. The specific flaw exists when accessing embedded style sheets within an HTML file. When modifying the properties of rules defined in the style the behavior element is improperly processed resulting in a memory corruption which can be further leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current user."

        "The attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer, then convince a user to view the website by clicking a link in an email or instant messenger message.",

      "required_capabilities": "The user must visit a specially crafted webpage. The attacker would have to convince users to visit the web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems."
