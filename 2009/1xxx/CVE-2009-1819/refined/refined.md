The provided content relates to CVE-2009-1819.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the 2DayBiz Custom T-shirt Design application, specifically in the `product.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, read sensitive data like usernames and passwords, modify data, or even gain control of the server hosting the application.
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the `product.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable `product.php` script. This is a remote vulnerability, so the attacker does not need local access.
