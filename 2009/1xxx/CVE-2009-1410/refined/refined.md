- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input in the `id` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to sanitize the `id` parameter in `index.php` before using it in an SQL query, allowing for SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other information, or to modify or delete data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is launched via an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
