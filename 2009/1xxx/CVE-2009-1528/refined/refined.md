  "CVE-2009-1528": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of object initialization or deletion when accessing them.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption due to accessing uninitialized or deleted objects."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the logged-on user. Complete control of the system is possible if the user has administrative privileges.",
    "attack_vector": "Visiting a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious web page. No other special capabilities are mentioned."
