Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure placement of the `archive.sh` script within the webserver's document root. This script contains a secret API key necessary for Piwik's auto-archiving functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the secret API key due to the script being directly accessible via HTTP.
*   **Insecure File Placement:** The `archive.sh` script, which contains sensitive information, was placed in the document root, making it publicly accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who obtains the API key could potentially gain unauthorized access to the Piwik instance and its data.
*   **Data Manipulation:** With the API key, an attacker could manipulate data within the Piwik installation.
*   **Data Breach:** This could lead to a data breach and compromise the confidentiality of the tracked data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker can directly request the `archive.sh` script via HTTP through the web browser.
*   **Web Scraping/Crawling:** Automated tools could also be used to scan for and retrieve the script if it is in the document root of the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target web server.
*   **Knowledge of the File Location:** The attacker needs knowledge (or the ability to discover) the location of `archive.sh` within the publicly accessible web directory.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required to access the vulnerable file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reported in March 2009.
*   The issue was marked as "Critical".
*   The recommendation was to move the `archive.sh` script to a location outside of the document root, making it inaccessible via HTTP.
*   The script contains a "secret" API key.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned issue number #599 in the Piwik project.
