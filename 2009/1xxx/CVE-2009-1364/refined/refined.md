  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2009-1364",
    "description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the embedded GD library in libwmf 0.2.8.4 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted WMF file.",
    "root_cause": "The embedded GD library copy in libwmf has a use-after-free vulnerability. Specifically, the `gdRealloc` function result was not properly assigned back to `im->clip->list`, causing a use-after-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted WMF file, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application, or a denial of service (application crash).",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted WMF file"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted WMF file and convince a user to open it with an application using the vulnerable `libwmf` library.",
    "position": "Remote attacker"
  }
