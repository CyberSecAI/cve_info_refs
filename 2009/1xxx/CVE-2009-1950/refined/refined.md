Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `yorum.asp` script within the WebEyes Guest Book v.3 application. Specifically, the `mesajid` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied input is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * **Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. This can result in a complete compromise of the application's database.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `yorum.asp` script.
    * **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `mesajid` parameter is the vulnerable point of injection.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
    * **Basic Understanding of SQLi:** The attacker should have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
    * **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement appended to the `mesajid` parameter:
```
http://[website]/[script]/yorum.asp?mesajid=11+union+select+0+from+msysobjects
```
This attempts to retrieve information about database objects, confirming the SQL injection vulnerability. The `11` is the original integer value of `mesajid`, the exploit is simply appending to this.
