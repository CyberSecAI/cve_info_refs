      "impact": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious SQL query via the 'linkid' parameter in the 'edlink.php' script.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required.",
	"additional_details": "The specific vulnerable code is located in edlink.php, where the linkid parameter is directly inserted into a SQL query without proper sanitization. This can allow the attacker to extract user, database, and version information."
