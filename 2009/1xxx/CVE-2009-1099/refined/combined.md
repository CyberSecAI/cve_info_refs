How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Sun JDK 5 was updated to Update18 and the Sun JDK 6 was updated
to Update 13 to fix various bugs and security issues.
CVE-2009-1093: LdapCtx in the LDAP service in Java SE Development Kit
(JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 Update 17 and earlier; 6
Update 12 and earlier; SDK and JRE 1.3.1\_24 and earlier; and 1.4.2\_19
and earlier does not close the connection when initialization fails,
which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (LDAP
service hang).
CVE-2009-1094: Unspecified vulnerability in the LDAP implementation in
Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0
Update 17 and earlier; 6 Update 12 and earlier; SDK and JRE 1.3.1\_24
and earlier; and 1.4.2\_19 and earlier allows remote LDAP servers to
execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors related to serialized data.
CVE-2009-1095: Integer overflow in unpack200 in Java SE Development Kit
(JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 Update 17 and earlier,
and 6 Update 12 and earlier, allows remote attackers to access files
or execute arbitrary code via a JAR file with crafted Pack200 headers.
CVE-2009-1096: Buffer overflow in unpack200 in Java SE Development Kit
(JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 Update 17 and earlier,
and 6 Update 12 and earlier, allows remote attackers to access files
or execute arbitrary code via a JAR file with crafted Pack200 headers.
CVE-2009-1097: Multiple buffer overflows in Java SE Development Kit
(JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 Update 12 and earlier
allow remote attackers to access files or execute arbitrary code
via a crafted (1) PNG image, aka CR 6804996, and (2) GIF image,
aka CR 6804997.
CVE-2009-1098: Buffer overflow in Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 Update 17 and earlier; 6 Update 12
and earlier; 1.4.2\_19 and earlier; and 1.3.1\_24 and earlier allows
remote attackers to access files or execute arbitrary code via a
crafted GIF image, aka CR 6804998.
CVE-2009-1099: Integer signedness error in Java SE Development Kit
(JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 Update 17 and earlier,
and 6 Update 12 and earlier, allows remote attackers to access files
or execute arbitrary code via a crafted Type1 font, which triggers
a buffer overflow.
CVE-2009-1100: Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Java SE
Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 Update
17 and earlier, and 6 Update 12 and earlier, allow remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) via vectors related
to temporary font files and (1) "limits on Font creation," aka CR
6522586, and (2) another unspecified vector, aka CR 6632886.
CVE-2009-1101: Unspecified vulnerability in the lightweight HTTP server
implementation in Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) 6 Update 12 and earlier allows remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (probably resource consumption) for
a JAX-WS service endpoint via a connection without any data, which
triggers a file descriptor "leak."
CVE-2009-1102: Unspecified vulnerability in the Virtual Machine in Java
SE Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 Update
12 and earlier allows remote attackers to access files and execute
arbitrary code via unknown vectors related to "code generation."
CVE-2009-1103: Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Plug-in in
Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0
Update 17 and earlier; 6 Update 12 and earlier; 1.4.2\_19 and earlier;
and 1.3.1\_24 and earlier allows remote attackers to access files and
execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors related to "deserializing
applets," aka CR 6646860.
CVE-2009-1104: The Java Plug-in in Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 Update 17 and earlier; 6 Update
12 and earlier; and 1.4.2\_19 and earlier does not prevent Javascript
that is loaded from the localhost from connecting to other ports on
the system, which allows user-assisted attackers to bypass intended
access restrictions via LiveConnect, aka CR 6724331. NOTE: this
vulnerability can be leveraged with separate cross-site scripting
(XSS) vulnerabilities for remote attack vectors.
CVE-2009-1105: The Java Plug-in in Java SE Development Kit (JDK)
and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 Update 12, 11, and 10 allows
user-assisted remote attackers to cause a trusted applet to run in
an older JRE version, which can be used to exploit vulnerabilities
in that older version, aka CR 6706490.
CVE-2009-1106: The Java Plug-in in Java SE Development Kit (JDK)
and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 Update 12, 11, and 10 does not
properly parse crossdomain.xml files, which allows remote attackers
to bypass intended access restrictions and connect to arbitrary sites
via unknown vectors, aka CR 6798948.
CVE-2009-1107: The Java Plug-in in Java SE Development Kit (JDK)
and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 Update 12 and earlier, and 5.0
Update 17 and earlier, allows remote attackers to trick a user into
trusting a signed applet via unknown vectors that misrepresent the
security warning dialog, related to a "Swing JLabel HTML parsing
vulnerability," aka CR 6782871.
No Sun Java 1.4.2 updates are available at this time since it has
entered EOL phase.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart applications using Sun Java after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## 1. Overview:

The Sun 1.5.0 Java release includes the Sun Java 5 Runtime Environment and
the Sun Java 5 Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Sun Java 5 Runtime
Environment and the Sun Java 5 Software Development Kit. These
vulnerabilities are summarized on the "Advance notification of Security
Updates for Java SE" page from Sun Microsystems, listed in the References
section. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2006-2426](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2426), [CVE-2009-1093](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1093), [CVE-2009-1094](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1094), [CVE-2009-1095](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1095), [CVE-2009-1096](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1096), [CVE-2009-1098](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1098), [CVE-2009-1099](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1099), [CVE-2009-1100](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1100), [CVE-2009-1103](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1103), [CVE-2009-1104](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1104) and [CVE-2009-1107](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1107) to these issues.

No Avaya system products are vulnerable, as java-1.5.0-sun is not installed by default.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0394.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with java-1.5.0-sun installed: None

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| AES 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed,
Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
IBM Java 6 SR 5 was released fixing various bugs and critical security
issues:
CVE-2009-1093: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with initializing LDAP connections may be exploited by a remote client
to cause a denial-of-service condition on the LDAP service.
CVE-2009-1094: A vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment LDAP
client implementation may allow malicious data from an LDAP server
to cause malicious code to be unexpectedly loaded and executed on an
LDAP client.
CVE-2009-1095
CVE-2009-1096: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) with unpacking applets and Java Web Start
applications using the unpack200 JAR unpacking utility may allow an
untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges. For example,
an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the
user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1097: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing PNG images may allow an untrusted Java Web
Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
application may grant itself permissions to read and write local
files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user
running the untrusted application.
CVE-2009-1097: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing GIF images may allow an untrusted Java Web
Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
application may grant itself permissions to read and write local
files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user
running the untrusted application.
CVE-2009-1098: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing GIF images may allow an untrusted applet
or Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example,
an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the
user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1099: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing fonts may allow an untrusted applet
or Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example,
an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the
user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with storing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet
or application to consume a disproportionate amount of disk space
resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with processing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to retain temporary files resulting in a denial-of-service
condition.
CVE-2009-1101: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
HTTP server implementation may allow a remote client to create a
denial-of-service condition on a JAX-WS service endpoint that runs
on the JRE.
CVE-2009-1103: A vulnerability in the Java Plug-in with deserializing
applets may allow an untrusted applet to escalate privileges. For
example, an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible
to the user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1104: The Java Plug-in allows Javascript code that is loaded
from the localhost to connect to any port on the system. This may
be leveraged together with XSS vulnerabilities in a blended attack
to access other applications listening on ports other than the one
where the Javascript code was served from.
CVE-2009-1105: The Java Plug-in allows a trusted applet to be launched
on an earlier version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provided
the user that downloaded the applet allows it to run on the requested
release. A vulnerability allows Javascript code that is present in
the same web page as the applet to exploit known vulnerabilities of
the requested JRE.
CVE-2009-1106: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment with
parsing crossdomain.xml files may allow an untrusted applet to connect
to any site that provides a crossdomain.xml file instead of sites
that allow the domain that the applet is running on.
CVE-2009-1107: The Java Plugin displays a warning dialog for signed
applets. A signed applet can obscure the contents of the dialog and
trick a user into trusting the applet.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of IBM Java after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

c. Third party library update for ntp.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
this advisory.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant
for ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

g. Updated Service Console package bind

Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5
The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
(column 4) if a solution is available.

#####

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these
issues.

The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)

j. Updated Service Console package gnutls

Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5\_3.5
A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- IBMJava5-JRE/java-1\_5\_0-ibm
The update brings IBM Java 5 to SR9-SSU.
It fixes a lot of security issues:
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with storing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to consume a disproportionate amount of disk space resulting
in a denial-of-service condition.
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with processing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to retain temporary files resulting in a denial-of-service
condition.
CVE-2009-1103: A vulnerability in the Java Plug-in with deserializing
applets may allow an untrusted applet to escalate privileges. For
example, an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to
the user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1104: The Java Plug-in allows Javascript code that is loaded
from the localhost to connect to any port on the system. This may be
leveraged together with XSS vulnerabilities in a blended attack to
access other applications listening on ports other than the one where
the Javascript code was served from.
CVE-2009-1093: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with
initializing LDAP connections may be exploited by a remote client to
cause a denial-of-service condition on the LDAP service.
CVE-2009-1094: A vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment LDAP client
implementation may allow malicious data from an LDAP server to cause
malicious code to be unexpectedly loaded and executed on an LDAP client.
CVE-2009-1107: The Java Plugin displays a warning dialog for signed
applets. A signed applet can obscure the contents of the dialog and trick
a user into trusting the applet.
CVE-2009-1095
CVE-2009-1096: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with unpacking applets and Java Web Start applications
using the unpack200 JAR unpacking utility may allow an untrusted applet
or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted applet
may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running the untrusted
applet.
CVE-2009-1098: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing GIF images may allow an untrusted applet or
Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an
untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local
files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user
running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1099: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing fonts may allow an untrusted applet or Java
Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.

Affected products: SLES9, OES, SLE10, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- ganglia-monitor-core
A stack buffer overflow in ganglia's buffer process\_path
function has been fixed. CVE-2009-0241 has
been assigned to this issue.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- ghostscript-devel
Specially crafted file could cause a heap-overflow in JBIG2 decoder
(CVE-2009-0196), an integer overflow in ICC library (CVE-2009-0792),
a buffer overflow in BaseFont writer module (CVE-2008-6679) or crash
the CCITTFax decoder (CVE-2007-6725).
The previous security update introduced a regression that broke some
printer drives. This new update fixes that issue.
Affected products: NLD9, SLES9, OES, SLE10, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libwmf
A specially crafted WMF files could crash libwmf. (CVE-2009-1364)
Affected products: NLD9, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libxine1/xine-devel
This update of libxine1 fixes an integer overflow in the qt\_error

allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed
Quicktime movie file. (CVE-2009-1274)
Affected products: NLD9, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- net-snmp
With this update of net-snmp the handling of TCP wrappers rules for
client authorization was improved, prior to this update it was possible

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

| Affected versions | < **1.6.0.17** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.5.0.22**>= **1.6.0.17** |

### Background

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the Sun Java
implementation. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below and
the associated Sun Alerts for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted JAR
archive, applet, or Java Web Start application, possibly resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. Furthermore, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of
Service affecting multiple services via several vectors, disclose
information and memory contents, write or execute local files, conduct
session hijacking attacks via GIFAR files, steal cookies, bypass the
same-origin policy, load untrusted JAR files, establish network
connections to arbitrary hosts and posts via several vectors, modify
the list of supported graphics configurations, bypass HMAC-based
authentication systems, escalate privileges via several vectors and
cause applet code to be executed with older, possibly vulnerable
versions of the JRE.

NOTE: Some vulnerabilities require a trusted environment, user
interaction, a DNS Man-in-the-Middle or Cross-Site-Scripting attack.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Sun JRE 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JRE 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JDK 1.5.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.5.0.22"
```

All Sun JDK 1.6.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/sun-jdk-1.6.0.17"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.5.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.5.0.22"
```

All users of the precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.6.x should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.6.0.17"
```

All Sun JRE 1.4.x, Sun JDK 1.4.x, Blackdown JRE, Blackdown JDK and
precompiled 32bit Sun JRE 1.4.x users are strongly advised to unmerge
Java 1.4:

```
 # emerge --unmerge =app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge =dev-java/sun-jdk-1.4*
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jdk
 # emerge --unmerge dev-java/blackdown-jre
```

Gentoo is ceasing support for the 1.4 generation of the Sun Java
Platform in accordance with upstream. All 1.4 JRE and JDK versions are
masked and will be removed shortly.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The update brings IBM Java 5 to SR9-SSU.
It fixes a lot of security issues:
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with storing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet
or application to consume a disproportionate amount of disk space
resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with processing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to retain temporary files resulting in a denial-of-service
condition.
CVE-2009-1103: A vulnerability in the Java Plug-in with deserializing
applets may allow an untrusted applet to escalate privileges. For
example, an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible
to the user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1104: The Java Plug-in allows Javascript code that is loaded
from the localhost to connect to any port on the system. This may
be leveraged together with XSS vulnerabilities in a blended attack
to access other applications listening on ports other than the one
where the Javascript code was served from.
CVE-2009-1093: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with initializing LDAP connections may be exploited by a remote client
to cause a denial-of-service condition on the LDAP service.
CVE-2009-1094: A vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment LDAP
client implementation may allow malicious data from an LDAP server
to cause malicious code to be unexpectedly loaded and executed on an
LDAP client.
CVE-2009-1107: The Java Plugin displays a warning dialog for signed
applets. A signed applet can obscure the contents of the dialog and
trick a user into trusting the applet.
CVE-2009-1095
CVE-2009-1096: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) with unpacking applets and Java Web Start
applications using the unpack200 JAR unpacking utility may allow an
untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges. For example,
an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the
user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1098: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing GIF images may allow an untrusted applet
or Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example,
an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the
user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1099: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing fonts may allow an untrusted applet
or Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example,
an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are accessible to the
user running the untrusted applet.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of IBM Java after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
