```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of the 'mosConfig_absolute_path' parameter in the imgcaptcha.php, mp3captcha.php, and swfmovie.php files of the ArtForms component. This allows an attacker to inject an arbitrary path.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending crafted HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP scripts (`imgcaptcha.php`, `mp3captcha.php`, and `swfmovie.php`) and specifying a malicious URL in the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No special privileges or prior access is required."
