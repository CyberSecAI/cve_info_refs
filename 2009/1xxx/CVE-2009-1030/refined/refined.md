Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**CVE-2010-1030 (HP-UX AudFilter DoS):**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of AudFilter rules in HP-UX.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability when AudFilter rules are enabled.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can cause a Denial of Service on the HP-UX system.
*   **Attack vectors:** Local access to the vulnerable HP-UX system is required.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected HP-UX system where AudFilter rules are enabled.

**CVE-2009-1030 (WordPress MU XSS):**
* **Root cause of vulnerability:** Failure to properly sanitize the `Host` header within the `choose_primary_blog` function in WordPress MU.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized input from the `Host` header.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code, potentially leading to cookie theft and privilege escalation to administrator level.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP `Host` header to inject code. The vulnerability is exposed when a user visits the affected page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress MU instance with a crafted `Host` header. This does not require any pre-existing user access.

**Note:** There is a discrepancy in the CVE ID. The HP Security Bulletin references CVE-2010-1030, while the Exploit-DB entry references CVE-2009-1030. The content from Exploit-DB clearly describes the WordPress MU vulnerability, while the HP content describes a HP-UX AudFilter vulnerability. Therefore, this analysis assumes that they are distinct vulnerabilities with different CVEs, despite being reported with the same ID.
