How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

It has been discovered that gst-plugins-good0.10, the GStreamer plugins
from the "good" set, are prone to an integer overflow, when processing
a large PNG file. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

| [Description](#c0)  Joby Walker    2002-05-07 19:56:23 UTC  ``` Attached is mailman.tar.gz, which contains: mailman-2.0.10.ebuild -- the ebuild for mailman 2.0.10 files/README -- Explanatory info with some install help files/mailman.conf -- file for inclusion in apache config files files/digest-mailman-2.0.10  Mailman is an excellent email list manager with an integrated web administrative and archive element.  Mailman is used by the gentoo email lists.  I suggest that it goes in net-mail/mailman, and it is dependant on >=python-1.5.2, virtual/mta, net-www/apache.  Feel free to contact me on any questions, comments, criticism.  This is my first submitted ebuild.  jbw ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Joby Walker    2002-05-07 19:58:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 888](attachment.cgi?id=888 "Tar.gz with mailman ebuild files") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=888&action=edit "Tar.gz with mailman ebuild files")] Tar.gz with mailman ebuild files ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Joby Walker    2002-06-20 12:39:17 UTC  ``` I noticed that the ebuild is being passed around.  Just curious about the current status, because I have an updated version for mailman-2.0.11 which has a couple bug fixes.  I would like to get the mailman ebuild to the newest version, but I don't want to delay it's release.  jbw -- zorloc@imperium.org ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Ben Lutgens (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-07-16 22:35:15 UTC  ```  i took what you had here, modified it slightly, updated to 2.0.12 and  committed it masked. Nice work on that package and THANK YOU!    Sorry it did get passed around alot, we had some major changes happening here.  ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# GStreamer plug-ins: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200907-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities in multiple GStreamer plug-ins might allow for the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/gst-plugins-good** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.10.14** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.14** |

| Package | **media-libs/gst-plugins-base** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.10.22** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.22** |

| Package | **media-plugins/gst-plugins-libpng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.10.14-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.10.14-r1** |

### Background

The GStreamer plug-ins provide decoders to the GStreamer open source
media framework.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in several GStreamer
plug-ins:

* Tobias Klein reported two heap-based buffer overflows and an array
  index error in the qtdemux\_parse\_samples() function in gst-plugins-good
  when processing a QuickTime media .mov file (CVE-2009-0386,
  CVE-2009-0387, CVE-2009-0397).
* Thomas Hoger of the Red Hat Security Response Team reported an integer
  overflow that can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow in the
  gst\_vorbis\_tag\_add\_coverart() function in gst-plugins-base when
  processing COVERART tags (CVE-2009-0586).
* Tielei Wang of ICST-ERCIS, Peking University reported multiple integer
  overflows leading to buffer overflows in gst-plugins-libpng when
  processing a PNG file (CVE-2009-1932).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system using a
GStreamer plug-in to process a specially crafted file, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All gst-plugins-good users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/gst-plugins-good-0.10.14"
```

All gst-plugins-base users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/gst-plugins-base-0.10.22"
```

All gst-plugins-libpng users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-plugins/gst-plugins-libpng-0.10.14-r1"
```
