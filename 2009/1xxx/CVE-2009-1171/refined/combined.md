Moodle File Disclosure Vulnerability

Systems Affected		Moodle series <1.6.9+, <1.7.7+, <1.8.9, <1.9.5
Severity				Critical
Probability of being vulnerable		Rather Low
Vendor				http://moodle.org/
Filed Bug			#MDL-18552
Author				Christian J. Eibl
Date				20090327

I. BACKGROUND

Moodle is an open source (webbased) learning management system with
users all over the world in educational institutes, schools, or
companies. See vendor homepage for details.

II. DESCRIPTION

An input filter for TeX formulas can be exploited to disclose files
readable by the web server. This includes the moodle configuration
file with all authentication data and server locations for directly
connecting to backend database.
TeX filter by default is off and in case of being activated mostly no
complete LaTeX environment on a server system will be available.

III. DETECTION OF VULNERABILITY

Since Moodle 1.6 a complete LaTeX environment is preferred over the
shipped mimetex program for rendering TeX formulas to images that can
be included in HTML pages.

In any text input area, e.g., forum, type something like "$$ \jobname
$$" (without quotes). If the result looks like
- "$$ \jobname $$":		TeX filter not activated
- "[jobname ?]":			TeX filter activated, but mimetex used
- "a91dbb..." (hash):		TeX filter active and LaTeX used (vuln.)

Since LaTeX per se is very powerful for file inclusion and even
writes, the vulnerability depends on LaTeX environment and its
configuration.

IV. EXPLOIT PoC

If LaTeX is not configured to restrict file inclusion (default!), then
absolute paths and relative ones can be used. As proof of concept
enter:
"$$ \input{/etc/passwd} $$"

In case the system is vulnerable, this will read the /etc/passwd file
and will render the contents to an image included in the text. Hence,
content is disclosed.

Rendering takes place in temporary folder by default which should not
be in the scope of the web server. Otherwise even arbitrary code could
be injected to compromise the whole web environment.
By using relative paths with background knowledge of Moodle's path
organization, it is easy to disclose the configuration file with
sensitive data.

V. WORKAROUND

Several alternatives:
1) deactivate TeX filter, if not needed
2) use more restrictive mimetex program for rendering
3) change LaTeX configuration (set "openin_any=p" for paranoid!)

... or upgrade to latest development version where patch should be
applied by now.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Package        : moodle
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-1171
Debian Bug     : 522116

Christian J. Eibl discovered that the TeX filter of Moodle, a web-based
course management system, doesn't check user input for certain TeX commands
which allows an attacker to include and display the content of arbitrary system
files.

Note that this doesn't affect installations that only use the mimetex
environment.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.3-2+etch3.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2.dfsg-3+lenny2.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2.dfsg-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your moodle packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- openswan/strongswan
By sending a specially crafted Dead Peer Detection (DPD) packet
remote attackers could crash the pluto IKE daemon (CVE-2009-0790).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- clamav
ClamAV was updated to version 0.95 to also fix some potential security
bugs. (CVE-2009-1241)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED, OES, SLES9-11
- gstreamer-0\_10-plugins-base
Specially crafted cover art tags in vorbis files could trigger a
heap overflow in the base64 decoder. Attackers could potentially
exploit that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0586).
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0, SLE11
- gnome-panel
The dbus package used a too permissive configuration. Therefore intended
access control for some services was not applied (CVE-2008-4311).
The new configuration denies access by default. Some dbus services break
due to this setting and need an updated configuration as well.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- postgresql
Remote authenticated users could crash the postgresql server by requesting
a conversion with an inappropriate encoding (CVE-2009-0922). This was a
minor version upgrade.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED, OES, SLES9-11
- acroread\_ja
Multiple flaws in the JBIG2 decoder and the JavaScript engine of the
Adobe Reader allowed attackers to crash acroread or even execute
arbitrary code by tricking users into opening specially crafted PDF
files. (CVE-2009-0658, CVE-2009-0927, CVE-2009-0193, CVE-2009-0928,
CVE-2009-1061, CVE-2009-1062)
Affected products: SLED10-11
- ghostscript
With this update the ghostscript-library four vulnerabilities were fixed:
- heap-overflow in JBIG2 decoder (CVE-2009-0196)
- integer overflow in ICC library (CVE-2009-0792)
- crash in CCITTFax decoder
- buffer overflow in BaseFont writer module
Affected products: SLE11 (packages for other products will be
released soon)
- xine-devel/libxine-devel
Specially crafted 4x movie files could cause an integer overflow in
xine-lib (CVE-2009-0698).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10-11
- moodle
Special command sequences in TeX files allowed users to read arbitrary
files (CVE-2009-1171).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- gnutls
The previous security fix for gnutls (CVE-2008-4989) introduced a re-
gression in the X.509 validation code for self-signed certificates.
This update fixes this problem.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10 (will be released soon),
SLE11
- udev update on SLES 10 requires udevd restart
The previously released udev update requires a restart of the udev
daemon on SLES 10. Either use
/etc/init.d/boot.udev restart
or reboot the machine.
On other SUSE products udevd is restarted by just applying the update
already.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
