      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_4bf1e896_20250124_140112.html",
      "root_cause": "The TeX filter in Moodle does not properly sanitize user input, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input sanitization",
        "File inclusion vulnerability"

      "impact": "An attacker can disclose files readable by the web server, including the Moodle configuration file containing sensitive authentication data and database connection details. In some scenarios arbitrary code could be injected.",

        "Abuse of TeX filter input",
         "File inclusion via LaTeX commands"

      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is present if LaTeX is used for rendering TeX formulas and if it is not configured to restrict file inclusion. The default LaTeX configuration is vulnerable."
