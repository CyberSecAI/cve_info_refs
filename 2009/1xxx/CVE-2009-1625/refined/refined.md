Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1625:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `index.php` file of Thickbox Gallery v2. Specifically, the `ln` parameter is vulnerable to path traversal.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application does not adequately validate user-supplied input for the `ln` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the server. This could include configuration files, source code, or other data that may aid in further attacks or expose sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is accessed through a web request by manipulating the `ln` parameter in the URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and must know the location of the vulnerable `index.php` file.

**Technical Details:**
* The exploit can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application's `index.php` file, using the `ln` parameter to specify the path of the file to include. For example: `http://127.0.0.1/[path]/index.php?ln=../../../../../../BOOTSECT.BAK%00`.
* The `%00` null byte is used to terminate the file path, potentially bypassing some basic file extension checks.
* This exploit allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the local filesystem which can lead to sensitive information disclosure.
