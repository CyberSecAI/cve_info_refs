  "CVE-2009-1855": {
    "description": "A stack overflow vulnerability exists in Adobe Acrobat and Reader when parsing malformed U3D model files within a PDF. Specifically, when processing a crafted extension block of a U3D model, insufficient bounds checking occurs before calling wcsncpy(), leading to a stack overflow and potential code execution.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient bounds checking when parsing a crafted extension block of a U3D model file within a PDF, before calling wcsncpy().",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack overflow",
         "Insufficient bounds checking"
      ],
        "impact_of_exploitation": "Remote code execution under the privileges of the user running the application, leading to system compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "Opening a malicious PDF file"
        ,"Visiting a malicious web address hosting a crafted PDF."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to create a specially crafted PDF file with a malformed U3D model and entice a user to open it."
    },
    "affected_products": [
        "Adobe Reader versions 9.1.1 and earlier, 8.1.5 and earlier, and 7.1.2 and earlier",
        "Adobe Acrobat (Standard, Professional, and 3D) versions 9.1.1 and earlier, 8.1.5 and earlier, and 7.1.2 and earlier"
      ],
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of U3D models, particularly when a crafted extension block is encountered, resulting in a stack buffer overflow due to missing boundary checks prior to using `wcsncpy()` function. This allows a remote attacker to gain control over the system. Successfully exploitation of this vulnerability could result in system compromise with the same access rights as the user running the vulnerable application. The attack is user-assisted, where opening the crafted PDF or visiting a malicious web address hosting the crafted PDF is required."
