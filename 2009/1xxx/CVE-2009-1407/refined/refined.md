Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `config.php` file of NotFTP 1.3.1. Specifically, the `$newlang` variable, when set, is used to construct a file path without validating the contents of `languages[$newlang]["file"]`.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. By manipulating the `newlang` parameter, an attacker can control the included file path through the `languages` array.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code directly uses user-controlled data to form a file path without any sanitization or validation, allowing traversal outside the intended directory.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's file system that the web server process has access to. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or even system files, such as `/etc/passwd`.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specifically crafted HTTP GET request to the `config.php` file. The `newlang` parameter and the `languages` array are appended to the URL as query string parameters.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable NotFTP application.
    *   **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable parameter and how to manipulate it to inject a file path. No authentication is needed.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet from `config.php` is:

```php
if (isset($newlang))
{
   require_once("lib/lang/".$languages[$newlang]["file"]);
}
elseif (isset($_COOKIE["notftplang"]))
{
   require_once("lib/lang/".$languages[$_COOKIE["notftplang"]]["file"]);
}
else
{
   require_once("lib/lang/".$languages[DEFAULTLANG]["file"]);
}
```

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability:

```
http://site.pl/path/config.php?newlang=kacper&languages[kacper][file]=../../../../../etc/passwd
```

This PoC sets the `newlang` to `kacper`, and the `languages['kacper']['file']` to traverse outside the intended directory and attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file.
