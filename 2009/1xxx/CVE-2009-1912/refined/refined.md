Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1912:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a combination of multiple weaknesses that can be chained together, including:

1.  **Cookie Injection:** The `language` cookie's value is not properly validated and is directly used to set the language path. By setting the `language` cookie to `..`, the `$this->language` variable becomes `languages/..`.
2.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `getlang.php` script includes files based on the `modul` GET parameter. The script uses `$this->language` from the cookie and doesn't properly sanitize the provided `modul` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary PHP files.
3.  **Blind SQL Injection:** The `awards.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `sort` and `type` parameters, which are directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization. Additionally, a check on the `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']` is bypassed by adding `&site=search` to the query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `language` cookie, the `modul` GET parameter, and the `sort` and `type` GET parameters are not properly validated or sanitized.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Arbitrary PHP files can be included using `getlang.php` due to insufficient checks on the `modul` parameter.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** User-controlled input is directly injected into an SQL query in `awards.php`.
*   **Security function bypass:** The check on `$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']` is easily bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By combining the LFI and SQL injection vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database via SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker crafts a malicious `language` cookie value (e.g. `..`)
*   The attacker sends a GET request to `getlang.php` with a crafted `modul` parameter to include arbitrary PHP files (e.g., `getlang.php?modul=pathtophpfile`).
*  The attacker sends a GET request to `awards.php` with a crafted  `sort` and `type` parameters along with `&site=search` to perform a blind SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests with custom cookies.
*   The attacker needs to know the structure of the application and the vulnerable parameters.
*   No specific privileges are needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to chain these vulnerabilities to extract the database version.
*   The vulnerability is found in webSPELL versions <= 4.2.0e. The solution is to upgrade to version 4.2.0f.

This detailed explanation clarifies the root cause, weaknesses, impact, attack vectors, and attacker capabilities required to exploit this vulnerability.
