Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a local file inclusion flaw in webEdition due to the way the `WE_LANGUAGE` parameter is handled. Specifically, the application includes files based on the provided `WE_LANGUAGE` parameter without proper sanitization, leading to path traversal. The code responsible is:
    ```php
    include_once($_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]."/webEdition/we/include/we_language/".$GLOBALS["WE_LANGUAGE"]."/start.inc.php");
    ```

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary local files. This is achieved by manipulating the `WE_LANGUAGE` parameter to include directory traversal sequences like `../../` along with a target file path.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `WE_LANGUAGE` parameter, allowing directory traversal sequences and other malicious input to be processed.
    *   **Reliance on `register_globals`:** The exploit relies on the `register_globals` PHP setting being enabled, which is a known security risk and is disabled by default in recent versions of PHP. This setting is necessary for the `$GLOBALS["WE_LANGUAGE"]` to be populated from the query parameter.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary local files. This can lead to information disclosure, such as reading configuration files, password files, or even gaining access to source code.
    *   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The exploit notes that by including files like Apache log files, it might be possible to inject and execute remote commands if the logs contain injected php code. This is a typical LFI to RCE technique.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP GET request, specifically by manipulating the `WE_LANGUAGE` parameter.
    *   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the URL, including path traversal sequences like `../../` to navigate up the directory structure to access files outside the intended scope.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely as the application is web-based.
    *   **Basic Web Knowledge:** Requires knowledge of how to manipulate URL parameters and basic understanding of path traversal techniques.
    *   **`register_globals` enabled:**  The target server must have `register_globals` enabled for the exploit to function as described.

**Additional Details (beyond the CVE description):**

*   The exploit explicitly mentions the requirement of `register_globals = on`, which is a crucial detail for the exploit to work.
*   The content provides a specific vulnerable code snippet showing how the `WE_LANGUAGE` parameter is used in a file include operation.
*   It outlines a specific attack path: `http://www.site.com/path/index.php?WE_LANGUAGE=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00` demonstrating how to exploit the LFI using a null byte.

In summary, this content details a Local File Inclusion vulnerability in webEdition that allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files by manipulating the `WE_LANGUAGE` parameter, potentially leading to information disclosure and remote command execution. The vulnerability is contingent on the PHP server having `register_globals` enabled and the use of directory traversal sequences and null byte injection.
