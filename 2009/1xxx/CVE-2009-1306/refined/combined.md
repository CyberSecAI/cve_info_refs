[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0437)

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
(CVE-2009-1303, CVE-2009-1305)

Several flaws were found in the way malformed web content was processed. A
web page containing malicious content could execute arbitrary JavaScript in
the context of the site, possibly presenting misleading data to a user, or
stealing sensitive information such as login credentials. (CVE-2009-0652,
CVE-2009-1306, CVE-2009-1307, CVE-2009-1309, CVE-2009-1312)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey saved certain web pages to a local
file. If a user saved the inner frame of a web page containing POST data,
the POST data could be revealed to the inner frame, possibly surrendering
sensitive information such as login credentials. (CVE-2009-1311)

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
the changes to take effect.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=496263#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-04-17 15:09:56 UTC  ``` Security researcher Gregory Fleischer reported that when an Adobe Flash file is loaded via the view-source: protocol, the Flash plugin misinterprets the origin of the content as localhost, leading to two specific vulnerabilities:     1. The Flash file can bypass restrictions imposed by the crossdomain.xml mechanism and initiate HTTP requests to arbitrary third-party sites. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker to perform CSRF attacks against these sites.    2. The Flash file, being treated as a local resource, can read and write Local Shared Objects on a user's machine. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker to place cookie-like objects on a user's computer and track them across multiple sites.  Additonally, Fleischer reported that the jar: protocol could be used to bypass restrictions normally preventing content loaded via view-source: from being rendered.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=496263#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-21 23:59:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1  Via RHSA-2009:0437 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0437.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=496263#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-22 01:43:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:0436 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0436.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=496263#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-04-22 20:25:09 UTC  ``` xulrunner-1.9.0.9-1.fc9, firefox-3.0.9-1.fc9, epiphany-extensions-2.22.1-10.fc9, epiphany-2.22.2-10.fc9, blam-1.8.5-8.fc9.1, chmsee-1.0.1-11.fc9, devhelp-0.19.1-11.fc9, evolution-rss-0.1.0-10.fc9, galeon-2.0.7-9.fc9, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-26.fc9, gnome-web-photo-0.3-20.fc9, google-gadgets-0.10.5-5.fc9, gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-28.fc9, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc9.1, Miro-2.0.3-3.fc9, mozvoikko-0.9.5-9.fc9, mugshot-1.2.2-8.fc9, ruby-gnome2-0.17.0-8.fc9, totem-2.23.2-14.fc9, yelp-2.22.1-11.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=496256#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-04-17 14:42:54 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Igor Bukanov reported a crash which affected both Firefox 2 and 3.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=496256#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-21 23:59:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1  Via RHSA-2009:0437 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0437.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=496256#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-22 01:43:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:0436 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0436.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=496256#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-04-22 20:24:55 UTC  ``` xulrunner-1.9.0.9-1.fc9, firefox-3.0.9-1.fc9, epiphany-extensions-2.22.1-10.fc9, epiphany-2.22.2-10.fc9, blam-1.8.5-8.fc9.1, chmsee-1.0.1-11.fc9, devhelp-0.19.1-11.fc9, evolution-rss-0.1.0-10.fc9, galeon-2.0.7-9.fc9, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-26.fc9, gnome-web-photo-0.3-20.fc9, google-gadgets-0.10.5-5.fc9, gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-28.fc9, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc9.1, Miro-2.0.3-3.fc9, mozvoikko-0.9.5-9.fc9, mugshot-1.2.2-8.fc9, ruby-gnome2-0.17.0-8.fc9, totem-2.23.2-14.fc9, yelp-2.22.1-11.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=496262#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-04-17 15:02:26 UTC  ``` Mozilla developer Daniel Veditz reported that when the jar: scheme is used to wrap a URI which serves the content with Content-Disposition: attachement, the HTTP header is ignored and the content is unpacked and displayed inline. A site may depend on this HTTP header to prevent potentially untrusted content that it serves from executing within the context of the site. An attacker could use this vulnerability to subvert sites using this mechanism to mitigate content injection attacks.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=496262#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-21 23:59:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1  Via RHSA-2009:0437 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0437.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=496262#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-22 01:43:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:0436 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0436.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=496262#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-04-22 20:25:05 UTC  ``` xulrunner-1.9.0.9-1.fc9, firefox-3.0.9-1.fc9, epiphany-extensions-2.22.1-10.fc9, epiphany-2.22.2-10.fc9, blam-1.8.5-8.fc9.1, chmsee-1.0.1-11.fc9, devhelp-0.19.1-11.fc9, evolution-rss-0.1.0-10.fc9, galeon-2.0.7-9.fc9, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-26.fc9, gnome-web-photo-0.3-20.fc9, google-gadgets-0.10.5-5.fc9, gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-28.fc9, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc9.1, Miro-2.0.3-3.fc9, mozvoikko-0.9.5-9.fc9, mugshot-1.2.2-8.fc9, ruby-gnome2-0.17.0-8.fc9, totem-2.23.2-14.fc9, yelp-2.22.1-11.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.

# USN-782-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

25 June 2009

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine of Thunderbird. If a

user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into viewing malicious web

content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-1303](/security/CVE-2009-1303), [CVE-2009-1305](/security/CVE-2009-1305), [CVE-2009-1392](/security/CVE-2009-1392), [CVE-2009-1833](/security/CVE-2009-1833),

[CVE-2009-1838](/security/CVE-2009-1838))

Several flaws were discovered in the way Thunderbird processed malformed

URI schemes. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website and

had JavaScript and plugins enabled, a remote attacker could execute

arbitrary JavaScript or steal private data. ([CVE-2009-1306](/security/CVE-2009-1306), [CVE-2009-1307](/security/CVE-2009-1307),

[CVE-2009-1309](/security/CVE-2009-1309))

Cefn Hoile discovered Thunderbird did not adequately protect against

embedded third-party stylesheets. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker

could exploit this to perform script injection attacks using XBL bindings.

([CVE-2009-1308](/security/CVE-2009-1308))

Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang, and Ming Zhang discovered that

Thunderbird did not properly handle error responses when connecting to a

proxy server. If a user had JavaScript enabled while using Thunderbird to

view websites and a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive

information. ([CVE-2009-1836](/security/CVE-2009-1836))

It was discovered that Thunderbird could be made to run scripts with

elevated privileges. If a user had JavaScript enabled while having

certain non-default add-ons installed and were tricked into viewing a

malicious website, an attacker could cause a chrome privileged object, such

as the browser sidebar, to run arbitrary code via interactions with the

attacker controlled website. ([CVE-2009-1841](/security/CVE-2009-1841))

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.9.0.9-0lenny2.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

When the jar: scheme wraps a URI that returns a Content-disposition: attachment header that will be ignored and the inner zip file unpacked and the specified file interpreted anyway. Since Content-disposition: attachment is often used to prevent potentially dangerous or unknown content from being interpreted by browsers as part of the serving host's domain this can lead to security issues as in [bug 472206 comment 27](/show_bug.cgi?id=472206#c27 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla should optionally not allow the user to view possibly harmful attachments")

Thanks for cc'ing us, but I wouldn't mind seeing what the impact of this is. I can't access the URL in [bug 472206 comment 27](/show_bug.cgi?id=472206#c27 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla should optionally not allow the user to view possibly harmful attachments") because I don't have a "Bugzilla Test Instances - LDAP Login". I tried this on our local Bugzilla install but I'm unsure of what it is I'm looking for.
Or maybe I just don't need to know.

That test URL should result in a dialog prompting you to save the file, and instead it opens the HTML content in the browser due to this bug. Since [bug 472206](/show_bug.cgi?id=472206 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla should optionally not allow the user to view possibly harmful attachments") is about using Content-disposition: attachment as an anti-XSS measure this is a problem. The specific impact of that should be discussed in that other bug since that tool will have to figure out a workaround until this client bug is fixed.Blocks: [472206](/show_bug.cgi?id=472206 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla should optionally not allow the user to view possibly harmful attachments")

view-source: has the same issue although it might take a pretty contrived situation to make it dangerous. Would be nice if we could fix it in a central place for all nested schemes rather than have to worry that a future scheme might forget to do the same check, but maybe that's not possible.

I guess this doesn't "block" 472206 since it looks like they'll ship regardless, since they've got a compelling upgrade with or without this problem.No longer blocks: [472206](/show_bug.cgi?id=472206 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla should optionally not allow the user to view possibly harmful attachments")

Attached patch

[Initial fix](attachment.cgi?id=361669&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=361669&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=474536&attachment=361669)

OK, I think I have an initial fix. Patch attached.
The patch is pretty simple conceptually: in the existing URILoader check for content-disposition, we pull out the 'transport channel' from JARChannel's (i.e. the channel that actually does the network transport of the file), and use it for the check. This should work for both HTTP and 'multipart' (Question: can JAR URLS use multipart? If so I think there may be some other places I want to check for security holes).
Most of the code changes are to change the JARChannel to keep a reference to its inner channel (these can be nested, so they ought to work for nested "jar:jar:http//..." urls: I will test these soon). JST tells me there's a good chance we could wind up with circular references to the inner channel, so I manually release the reference in OnStopRequest(). There is a new nsIJARChannel2.idl file to export the new GetTransportChannel() method, since we can't add the method to the regular IDL (it's frozen).
I've tested this on HTTP on my laptop, and we now see a download dialog when you try to download a JAR that has "content-disposition: attach" in its headers. (I'd make this test public, but I need to be able to tweak http.conf--a regular htaccess file can't do what's needed). The non-attach case still loads the JAR. So things seem to be working. I still need to run this through the triserver, plus look into making a mochitest (?), plus test the nested (and multipart?) cases. But I figured I'd post this patch so I can get some feedback in case I'm using the wrong approach.

> Question: can JAR URLS use multipart?
Multipart handling is triggered by the MIME type, so if there is an extension that would map to that type then yes.
nsIJARChannel isn't frozen, unless I'm missing something...
As far as the patch goes, I was wondering whether it's instead time to bite the bullet and finally introduce an interface that exposes content-disposition information (or at least just the whole disposition string) that all three of the relevant channels (jar, http, part) would implement. That would also let extensions expose content-disposition without having to change the core to do so... I thought we had an existing bug on this, but can't find it; it might be that we do not.
Note also that we have other callers in our tree that get content-disposition that should probably also be adjusted.
As far as the patch goes, you probably need to drop the mInnerChannel reference if AsyncOpen fails, since you won't get an OnStopRequest in that case. In GetTransportChannel you'd want to use NS\_ADDREF, not an explicit AddRef call to be consistent with other code. Your indentation in nsJARChannel.h for the "public nsIJARChannel2" line is off; did tabs sneak in?
This setup doesn't seem to deal with cases when the underlying channel is an HTTP channel that gets a 3xx response that redirects to an HTTP 200 response with Content-Disposition, since you'll try to get disposition off the pre-redirect channel. If we do decide to keep track of the channel, we'd need to listen for redirects and update on redirect. But if we just hand out the disposition string, it seems like we could do well enough by just grabbing it off the channel passed in to us in OnDownloadComplete, like we do for security info and so forth.

Attached patch

[Second attempt at fix, using Boris' advice](attachment.cgi?id=363038&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=363038&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=474536&attachment=363038)

OK, here's a second attempt at a patch. I've tested it and it appears to work, including on nested jar:jar:http urls.
Patch notes:
> finally introduce an interface that exposes content-disposition
> information (or at least just the whole disposition string) that
> all three of the relevant channels (jar, http, part) would implement.
I've made a start at this, but to keep the patch small, I've so far only made the change to nsJARChannel. With a little extra work I could make make multichannels also inherit from nsHashPropertyBag, and then make both it and nsHttpChannel store the Content-Disposition using the same property key, and we'll have a unified interface. This would actually simplify the code a bit, but would also mean more overall code changed. Let me know if that's appropriate, of if we'd rather keep the patch small for the release branch. I'd vote for just making the additional changes.
I've changed nsJARChannel to inherit from nsHashPropertyBag (just like the nsHttpChannel and nsBaseChannel classes already do). Rather than trying to keep a pointer to the transport channel (as in the last patch), we now grab the Content-Disposition header from the HTTP channel (or inner JARChannel for nested jar:jar URLs) in OnDownloadComplete, and stuff it into the JARChannel's properties.
There are no checks for either Content-Disposition or Content-Type within nsJARChannel::OnDownloadComplete for the multipart case (see comment in patch). Should there be? I created a CGI script that feeds a JAR as the first part of a multipart reply, but it winds up failing (since the root content-type is multipart, not application/java-archive). So I'm not sure it's even a possible case. But Boris mentioned that a MIME extension could be mapped to multipart--I'm not sure if I understand how that would work, or if it's relevant.
Also haven't addressed the fact that we're currently using (slightly different) duplicated logic to parse the Content-disposition header in about 3-4 places in the codebase--at some point I'd like to centralize this in a function in nsNetUtils.h. I thought of storing logical values (ATTACHMENT, INLINE) in the properties, rather than the raw Content-Disposition header, so we could truly centralize the parsing, but I'm not sure I know all the use cases, so for now it's the raw header.
I'm using Christian's scheme for centralizing Channel property names in nsChannelProperties.h. This required eliminating a define of IMPL\_NS\_NET in a test program's Makefile, which shouldn't have had it set anyway, as near as I can tell (the only side effect of not having it set is that the program will call NS\_LITERAL\_STRING, which is slightly less efficient).
Finally, while poking through the code I realized we didn't have "Content-Disposition" as a static HTTP\_ATOM, so I added it.

Oh, nice. I hadn't realized we had this, actually. ;)
We should add other properties here; there's a whole bunch that some channels expose... (base URIs and referrers come to mind offhand). File a followup bug on doing that?

More weird indentation, especially for "header);".
For what it's worth, I wouldn't bother putting the bug# in the comments, or adding comments to the effect that this fixes some bug. That's what hg/cvs blame is for.

More weird indent. At the moment, the inner channel here in fact cannot be multipart; the only way to get a multipart channel is via the stream converter that decodes multipart responses. So while the underlying channel of a part channel could be a jar channel, the reverse can't happen.

I guess this fixes the issue with showing inline but doesn't actually use the filename for anything. That might be ok, I guess.
Fix the above (esp. the nsNetStrings) issue, and looks good. Let's get this in on trunk and branch and file a followup bug for making all three channels use the property on trunk? I'd love to see some code simplification happening here. ;)

OK, here's another patch.
I've made all the changes that Boris suggested.
Comments/notes:
Weird indentations: yes they were tabs.
yes, HTTP\_ATOM(Content\_Disposition) is an optimization. Otherwise we dynamically allocate an atom (I haven't looked to see if that's per lookup, or just the first lookup).
> multipart channels may not use http
What else can they use? Are we using nsMultipartChannel to handle ftp requests? multipart emails?
> There should be a corresponding change to nsNetStrings.cpp, right?
Thanks--nice catch. Previously I wasn't initializing this, so any code where IMPL\_NS\_NET isn't defined (i.e any code outside the same shared object as gNetStrings) would have wound up not finding the property, since we'd be using different strings.
Which brings me to my main question: why are we storing channel properties this way (ie. in a hashtable)? It seems like a big kludge to me, compared with something like a new .idl interface (nsIChannelProperties) with separate accessor methods for each stored property. In the latter case the compiler will guarantee that we add logic to every channel when we add a new property, so no channel gets "missed." It will also be more efficient: (accessing a member variable, rather than kludging around with the IMPL\_NS\_NETWORK hack in order to skip an 8-16 bit string conversion, only to wind up still incurring a hashtable lookup). On all fronts (amount of code, maintainability, efficiency) the whole nsChannelProperties.h/nsNetString.h strategy looks like a stinker to me. Anyone care to defend it? Otherwise I propose adding that our new bug about additional properties to add also include converting to using a new .idl interface.

I can grab the filename if you tell me how to then pass it up within nsURILoader. Do we want this for the immediate patch? Also, looking at the logic it appears that we treat malformed "Content-Disposition: filename=foo.txt" and/or "name=foo.txt" as "inline", rather than "attachment". Is it common to pass a filename with "inline", or should those be considered to imply attachment instead? I haven't changed it because I'm assuming the logic was added this way for a reason.
Finally, the removal of the IMPL\_NS\_NETWORK from the test makefile is because the code will not compile with it, since the test does not link against the network shared lib, and thus can't find the global gNetStrings variable.

> Are we using nsMultipartChannel to handle ftp requests?
We're handling it for any load in a docshell (browser area) or through imagelib which comes back with the MIME type application/x-mixed-replace. This could be an HTTP channel, a data: channel, some extension-implemented channel, an FTP channel pointing to a file whose extension maps to that MIME type for some reason, etc, etc.
> why are we storing channel properties this way (ie. in a hashtable)
I think mainly because it lets us add new properties without breaking binary compatibility... In particular, we want to be able to add properties that are "optional" in the sense that channels may, but do not have to, set them. This property is a good example of such. I think the nsChannelProperties/nsNetStrings thing doesn't save us all that much; we could be using NS\_LITERAL\_STRING at all callsites just like we do when not IMPL\_NS\_NET. It's just good to have a source of documentation for properties people might look for on channels, which is why I suggested adding the other properties to this file. Just in the documentation section is probably fine; I wouldn't worry about adding to gNetStrings, I think.
> I can grab the filename if you tell me how to then pass it up within
> nsURILoader. Do we want this for the immediate patch?
No; let's do that as a followup. It'll be easier once the code for content-disposition is simpler... The relevant callers are scattered about (e.g. nsExternalHelperAppService), and as we unify the API things should Just Work for them for free. We might want to expose the filename/disposition separately from the entire header too, as discussed in that other bug I pointed you at; we can think about that in the followup bug.
> we treat malformed "Content-Disposition: filename=foo.txt" and/or
> "name=foo.txt" as "inline
Yeah. That's unfortunately fairly common, and needs to be treated inline for web compat. :(

We should also get this in on branches once it's baked on trunk a bit. Poke me to land on 1.9.1 in a few days, and at that point we should ask for 1.9.0 approval too.Status: NEW → RESOLVEDClosed: 16 years agoFlags: in-testsuite?Resolution: --- → FIXED

OK, at long last, here's a test for this bug. Includes a JAR file and ^headers^ file. Right now just tests that JARChannel contains "content-disposition" property, in PropertyBag interface. Will eventually extend test to cover HTTP and Multi: I'm creating a new bug for that work.
I've tested the test, and it works.

Set up an HTTP server that serves up .jar files with a "content-disposition:attachment" header and then see whether you can open them via a jar:// URI or whether you get a "save as" dialog instead. Then repeat the test without the header to make sure that the header is in fact affecting the behavior you see.

Just in case it matters, I've done the exact tests that Boris has described on my laptop.
If the code needs verification by someone else, I can email you the tarball and HTML page with test links (you'd still need to configure apache httpd.conf to add the disposition header for one directory).
But like I said, I've already tested myself.

Sweet. Give it a try with the 1.9.0 nightly at ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla1.9.0/ (use the 3.0.9pre build, not the 3.0.8).

I've verified that this is fixed for 3.0.9pre, using the tests on my laptop.

Marking as verified for 1.9.0.9, which is what you checked. Leaving resolved otherwise.

Actually, VERIFIED refers to trunk verification which happened in [comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=474536#c36 "VERIFIED FIXED - The jar: scheme ignores the content-disposition: header on the inner URI") and [comment 38](/show_bug.cgi?id=474536#c38 "VERIFIED FIXED - The jar: scheme ignores the content-disposition: header on the inner URI"). For 1.9.1 verification, we use the "verified1.9.1" keyword, replacing "fixed1.9.1".
Ah, Bugzilla, how I love you so.Keywords: [fixed1.9.1](/buglist.cgi?keywords=fixed1.9.1&resolution=---) → [verified1.9.1](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verified1.9.1&resolution=---)

1.8.0 doesn't look affected, it refuses to load jar: from http.

Then you're doing something wrong. It works fine, assuming your server is sending the right content-type for the jar.

At-risk sites would have to
1) allow arbitrary user-uploaded content
2) allow users to set arbitrary MIME types, or specifically support
.jar files as application/java-archive or application/x-jar
3) Serve them from a domain with sensitive content they need to protect
using Content-disposition: attachment to prevent XSS
The MIME type restriction was added in [bug 369814](/show_bug.cgi?id=369814 "RESOLVED FIXED - jar: protocol is an XSS hazard due to ignoring mime type and being considered same-origin with hosting site") (MFSA 2007-37) <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-37.html>Flags: wanted1.8.0.x?

I was able to verify that "Content-disposition: attachment" does not trigger the helper dialog on current 1.8 branch; with this patch it properly triggers the helper dialog.

The test is pre-[bug 396226](/show_bug.cgi?id=396226 "RESOLVED FIXED - Need way to delay server response in mochitest"), and in particular it assumes nsIHttpServer.stop is synchronous, returning only when shutdown is complete. Control flow should now continue in a callback function passed to the stop() method; using do\_test\_finished as the argument and replacing the break with a return will probably do the trick, at a glance.

This update also includes the following non-security fixes:
- Fixes a critical crasher in mailer component.
- Fixes creation of recurrence monthly items in GroupWise.
- Includes fixes for some usability issues.
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- freetype2
Freetype was updated to fix some integer overflows that can be exploited
remotely in conjunction with programs like a web-browser.
(CVE-2009-0946)
Thanks to Tavis Ormandy who found the bugs.
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- java-1\_4\_2-ibm/IBMJava2
This update brings IBM Java 1.4.2 to Service Release 13.
It fixes lots of bugs and following security issues:
CVE-2008-3104: Security vulnerabilities in the Java
Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet that is
loaded from a remote system to circumvent network access
restrictions and establish socket connections to certain
services running on the local host, as if it were loaded
from the system that the applet is running on. This may
allow the untrusted remote applet the ability to exploit
any security vulnerabilities existing in the services it
has connected to.
CVE-2008-3112: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create arbitrary files with the
permissions of the user running the untrusted Java Web
Start application.
CVE-2008-3113: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create or delete arbitrary files with
the permissions of the user running the untrusted Java
Web Start application.
CVE-2008-3114: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to
determine the location of the Java Web Start cache.
CVE-2008-5350: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or
application to list the contents of the home directory of
the user running the applet or application.
CVE-2008-5346: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an
untrusted applet or application to read arbitrary memory
locations in the process that the applet or application is
running in.
CVE-2008-5343: A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java
Plug-in may allow hidden code on a host to make network
connections to that host and to hijack HTTP sessions using
cookies stored in the browser.
CVE-2008-5344: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with applet classloading may allow an
untrusted applet to read arbitrary files on a system that
the applet runs on and make network connections to hosts
other than the host it was loaded from.
CVE-2008-5359: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow
an untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges.
For example, an untrusted applet may grant itself
permissions to read and write local files or execute local
applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5339: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java Web Start
application to make network connections to hosts other than
the host that the application is downloaded from.
CVE-2008-5340: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with launching Java Web Start applications may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted application may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted application.
CVE-2008-5348: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with authenticating users through
Kerberos may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) to the
system as a whole, due to excessive consumption of
operating system resources.
CVE-2008-2086: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow
certain trusted operations to be performed, such as
modifying system properties.
CVE-2008-5345: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows
code loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost.
This may allow code that is maliciously placed on the local
filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network
access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed if
the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be
leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains
that map a name to the localhost).
CVE-2008-5351: The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8)
decoder in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts
encodings that are longer than the "shortest" form. This
behavior is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may
be leveraged to exploit systems running software that
relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form
sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be
decoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that
are not otherwise accessible to be read, if the URIs are
not checked following UTF-8 decoding.
CVE-2008-5360: The Java Runtime Environment creates
temporary files with insufficiently random names. This may
be leveraged to write JAR files which may then be loaded as
untrusted applets and Java Web Start applications to access
and provide services from localhost and hence steal cookies.
CVE-2008-5353: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects
may allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5356: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5354: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java
application that is launched through the command line to
escalate privileges. For example, the untrusted Java
application may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are
accessible to the user running the untrusted Java
application.
This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or
Java Web Start application.
CVE-2008-5357: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.

downloaded from another system to request local files to be
displayed by the browser of the user running the untrusted
application.
Affected products: SUSE CORE 9, SLE 10
- kdegraphics3
This update fixes security problems while decoding JBIG2.
(CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-0165, CVE-2009-0166,
CVE-2009-0799, CVE-2009-0800, CVE-2009-1179, CVE-2009-1180,
CVE-2009-1181, CVE-2009-1182, CVE-2009-1183)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libopenssl-devel/openssl/compat-openssl097g
This update of openssl fixes the following problems:
- CVE-2009-0590: ASN1\_STRING\_print\_ex() function allows remote denial
of service
- CVE-2009-0591: CMS\_verify() function allows signatures to look valid
- CVE-2009-0789: denial of service due to malformed ASN.1 structures
Affected products: SLES 9, SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libsoup
Large strings could lead to a heap overflow in the base64 encoding and
decoding functions. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0585).
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, POS 9, OES, SLES 9, SLE 10
- opensc/libopensc2
Private data objects on smartcards initialized with OpenSC could be
accessed without authentication (CVE-2009-0368).
Only blank cards initialized with OpenSC are affected by this
problem. Affected cards need to be manually fixed, updating the
opensc package alone is not sufficient!
Please carefully read and follow the instructions on the following
web site if you are using PIN protected private data objects on
smart cards other than Oberthur, and you have initialized those
cards using OpenSC:
<http://en.opensuse.org/Smart_Cards/Advisories>
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- python-crypto
Missing checks for the key length in the ARC2 module potentially allowed
attackers to crash applications using python-crypto or potentially even
cause execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0544).
Affected products: SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- unbound
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow in the
ldns\_rr\_new\_frm\_str\_internal()
function. This allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
DNS resource record (RR) with a long class field and possibly TTL field.
(CVE-2009-1086)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could lead to crashes, make the viewer
run into an infinite loop or potentially even allow execution of
arbitrary code.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-16

## jar: scheme ignores the content-disposition: header on the inner URI

Announced
April 21, 2009
Reporter
Daniel Veditz
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.9

### Description

Mozilla developer **Daniel Veditz** reported that when
the `jar:` scheme is used to wrap a URI which serves the
content with `Content-Disposition: attachment`, the HTTP
header is ignored and the content is unpacked and displayed inline. A
site may depend on this HTTP header to prevent potentially untrusted
content that it serves from executing within the context of the site.
An attacker could use this vulnerability to subvert sites using this
mechanism to mitigate content injection attacks.

This vulnerability has not been fixed on the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch,
which is used to build Firefox 2 and Thunderbird 2. However, note
that there are several mitigating factors which prevent easy
exploitation of this issue. In order for a website to be exploitable
it must:

1. Allow users to upload arbitrary content
2. Allow users to set arbitrary MIME types, or specifically serve
   .jar files as `application/java-archive`
   or `application/x-jar`
3. Serve the .jar files from a domain containing sensitive content which would otherwise be protected using `Content-Disposition: attachment`
