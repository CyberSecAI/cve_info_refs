Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `product_info.php` file of CRE Loaded v6.2. Specifically, the `products_id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`products_id` parameter) into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database server.
- **Data Disclosure:** The attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as administrator email addresses and passwords (`admin_email_address`, `admin_password`).
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** With access to the administrator credentials, an attacker could potentially gain full control over the application and potentially the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request targeting `product_info.php`, injecting SQL code into the `products_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable CRE Loaded application.
- **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft a malicious SQL injection payload.
- **No Authentication Required:** This particular vulnerability can be exploited without authentication to the application.

**Exploit Details:**
The provided exploit is:
`product_info.php?products_id=-1+union+select+1,concat_ws(0x203a20,admin_email_address,admin_password)+from+admin--`
This exploits the SQL injection vulnerability by injecting a `UNION SELECT` statement that retrieves the admin's email address and password from the `admin` table.
