Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-1573:

**Root Cause:**

The `xvfb-run` script in X.org (specifically in Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora distributions) insecurely passes the X magic cookie (MCOOKIE) via the command line when starting a virtual X server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command-line Exposure:** The `xvfb-run` script uses `mcookie` to generate an X magic cookie, which is then directly included in the command line when `xauth` is invoked.
*   **Process Visibility:** Command-line arguments are often visible through tools like `ps` or `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, making the magic cookie easily accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Session Hijacking:** A local attacker who can observe the command line can obtain the X magic cookie. This cookie can be used to gain access to the X server session initiated by `xvfb-run`.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If a user with higher privileges (e.g., root) uses `xvfb-run`, the attacker could potentially gain access to those higher privileges by hijacking the X session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local system access to view the process list.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have a user account on the target system.
*   **Process Observation:** The attacker needs to be able to view the command-line arguments of running processes.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability stems from the following lines in the `xvfb-run` script:

```bash
MCOOKIE=$(mcookie)
XAUTHORITY=$AUTHFILE xauth add ":$SERVERNUM" "$XAUTHPROTO" "$MCOOKIE" \
  >"$ERRORFILE" 2>&1
```

Here, the generated `MCOOKIE` is directly passed as an argument to the `xauth add` command, making it visible via process lists.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the `xvfb-run` script to use `xauth source -` and passing the cookie via standard input instead of the command line. The corrected code looks like this:

```bash
XAUTHORITY=$AUTHFILE xauth source - << EOF >>"$ERRORFILE" 2>&1
add :$SERVERNUM $XAUTHPROTO $MCOOKIE
EOF
```
This prevents the cookie from being exposed in the command line.

**Affected Distributions:**

*   Debian
*   Ubuntu (versions 9.04, 8.04)
*   Fedora 10

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix also included a change to use `mktemp` for creating temporary directories instead of hardcoding `/tmp/xvfb-run.$$`
