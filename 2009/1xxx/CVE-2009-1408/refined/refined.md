Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-1408

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly sanitize BBCode input within the webSPELL CMS, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code. Specifically, the vulnerability is present when using the `[email]`, `[img]`, and `[url]` BBCode tags in combination with each other.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The BBCode parser does not correctly handle certain combinations of tags, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through crafted BBCode input.

- **BBCode Bypass:** The vulnerability is caused by a bypass of the intended BBCode sanitization, allowing malicious input to pass through.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Stealing:** An attacker can inject JavaScript to steal user cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts on the vulnerable webSPELL installation. This could lead to account hijacking, data breaches, and other malicious activities.
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites, injecting malware, or performing other unwanted actions.
- **Website Defacement:** The injected JavaScript could be used to modify the content of the page, potentially leading to website defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted BBCode input within the webSPELL CMS, likely in areas where user-generated content is displayed, such as forum posts, comments, or user profiles.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to input BBCode into the web application. This typically would require the attacker to be a registered user (or in some cases, an unauthenticated user) who can post content to the web application.
- The attacker needs to have some understanding of HTML/JavaScript in order to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was identified and patched in webSPELL version 4.2.0d.
- The exploit details include proof-of-concept (PoC) code, demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited. This includes example BBCode payloads that can be used to trigger the vulnerability in both Firefox and Internet Explorer browsers.
- The exploit also includes example PHP code for capturing the stolen cookies.
- The vulnerability was identified on April 14, 2009 and patched on the same day.
- The vulnerable versions are likely 4.2.0c and possibly prior versions of webSPELL.
