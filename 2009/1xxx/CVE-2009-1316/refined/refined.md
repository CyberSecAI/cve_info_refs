Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-1316:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The application, AbleSpace 1.0, suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to improper input sanitization and handling.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** Multiple instances of blind SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in `events_view.php` (parameter `eid`) and `events_clndr_view.php` (parameter `id`).
    *   **Stored XSS:** A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present in `blogs_full.php`.
    *   **Linked XSS:** Multiple linked XSS vulnerabilities are found in `groups_profile.php` (parameter `gid`) and `adv_cat.php` (parameters `cat_id`, `razd_id`).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to inject malicious SQL code, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying database content, or even taking control of the database server. This can lead to data breaches, loss of data integrity, and full system compromise.
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and other malicious activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Attacker manipulates URL parameters, `eid` and `id` in `events_view.php` and `events_clndr_view.php` respectively, to inject SQL code.
    *   **Stored XSS:** Attacker injects malicious script in `blogs_full.php` which is stored and executed when other users view this page.
    *   **Linked XSS:** Attacker crafts malicious URLs with script in `gid`, `cat_id` and `razd_id` parameters in `groups_profile.php` and `adv_cat.php` respectively, which gets executed when users click them.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application.
    *   For SQL Injection and linked XSS, basic knowledge of crafting malicious URLs is required.
    *   For stored XSS, the attacker needs the ability to post content to the vulnerable page.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vendor did not respond to the vulnerability reports and no patches are available.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Digital Security Research Group [DSecRG].
