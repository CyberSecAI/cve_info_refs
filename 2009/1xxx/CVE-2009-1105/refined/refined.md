{
  "CVE-2009-1105": {
    "Root cause": "The Java Plug-in allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a trusted applet to run in an older JRE version.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The Java Plug-in does not prevent a trusted applet from running in older JRE versions."
    ],
    "Impact": "A trusted applet running in an older JRE version can be exploited due to vulnerabilities present in the older version.  This can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the applet.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "User-assisted remote attack."
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a user to run a trusted applet in an older, vulnerable JRE version."
