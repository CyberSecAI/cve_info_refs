```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in Zervit Web Server 0.02, triggered when a requested URI is not found. The server copies the requested URI into a fixed-size buffer `tmp[255]` without proper bounds checking.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact is a denial of service (DoS). By sending a URI longer than 255 characters, the buffer `tmp` is overflowed, causing a crash.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending a specially crafted HTTP request with an overly long URI."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges or position is required, as the vulnerability is reachable through a standard HTTP request."
