  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2009-1703",
    "description": "WebKit's handling of audio and video HTML elements allows a remote website to reference local \"file:\" URLs. A maliciously crafted website could perform file existence checking, which may lead to information disclosure. This update addresses the issue through improved handling of audio and video elements.",
    "affected_components": [
      "WebKit"
    ],
    "root_cause": "WebKit's handling of audio and video HTML elements allows a remote website to reference local \"file:\" URLs.",
     "weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
       "Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer"
    ],
    "impact": "A maliciously crafted website could perform file existence checking, which may lead to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vector": "Visiting a maliciously crafted website.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a website that can be visited by a victim.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability lies in the way WebKit processes the audio and video HTML elements, specifically when handling URLs. This allows a remote website to potentially check if local files exist on the user's system by referencing their paths via file URLs. This is a form of information disclosure. The vulnerability is fixed by restricting the usage of local file URLs within audio and video elements."
