Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2009-1850
*   **Vulnerable Software:** phpBugTracker 1.0.3
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is an SQL injection vulnerability due to improper input sanitization in the login process. Specifically, it is vulnerable to a login bypass using SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. This occurs because the application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *  **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the application's authentication mechanism.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application by bypassing the authentication system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Login Form:** The attack vector is the application's login form.
    *   **SQL Injection String:** The provided example uses a simple SQL injection string `' or '1'='1` in the password field, which always evaluates to true and bypasses the regular password check.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to access the login form of the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required, as the vulnerability itself bypasses the authentication process.

**Summary:**
The provided content details an SQL injection vulnerability in phpBugTracker 1.0.3 that allows an attacker to bypass authentication by injecting a SQL condition that always evaluates to true. The vulnerability can be exploited simply through the login form of the application.
