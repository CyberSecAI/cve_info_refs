      "description": "This advisory from the Zero Day Initiative describes a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer related to the onreadystatechange event. The vulnerability occurs when repeated calls to getElementsByTagName() and reordering of elements cause an object to be allocated. The improper use of the onreadystatechange event leads to the previously allocated resource being freed. With repeated rendering, it results in exploitable memory corruption. User interaction is required for successful exploitation via a malicious page visit."

The bulletin notes that this specific vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability due to the way Internet Explorer accesses an improperly initialized or deleted object.  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious webpage that will cause memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution under the user's context. The bulletin also details mitigating factors, workarounds, and affected software."

    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a specially crafted web page that is designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed with Internet Explorer.  User interaction is required via visiting the malicious page.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website, or use compromised sites, and convince the user to visit the malicious webpage via email, IM, or other means."
