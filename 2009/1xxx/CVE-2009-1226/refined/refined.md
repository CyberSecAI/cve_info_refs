Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2009-1226:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `delete.php` script within the Podcast Generator application, where an attacker can delete arbitrary files without admin authentication due to insufficient checks on the file path provided in the `file` parameter.
*  The `scriptconfig.php` script is also vulnerable as it does not sanitize the `recent` parameter which allows for code injection when writing to the config file

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The `delete.php` script allows any user to delete files on the server by manipulating the `file` and `ext` parameters.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The `scriptconfig.php` script fails to sanitize the `recent` parameter allowing an attacker to inject code into the config file.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The `delete.php` script lacks authentication checks, allowing unauthorized users to access and manipulate it.
*  **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `scriptconfig.php` fails to sanitize input parameters which allows for code injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion**: The attacker can delete any file on the server, potentially leading to a denial of service or data loss.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can inject malicious PHP code through the `recent` parameter, achieving remote code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:**  The arbitrary file deletion is achieved by sending a crafted GET request to `delete.php` with a manipulated `file` parameter.
*   **HTTP POST Request:**  The remote code execution is achieved by sending a crafted POST request to `scriptconfig.php` with malicious code in the `recent` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to first delete `config.php`, then create a new configuration with credentials that can be used to login, and inject the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP GET and POST requests.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable path:** The attacker needs to know the path of the vulnerable application on the server.
