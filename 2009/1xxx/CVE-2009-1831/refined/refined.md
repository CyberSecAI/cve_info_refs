    "CVE-2009-1831": [
        {
            "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the MAKI script parsing within Winamp.",
            "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer Overflow: When processing a size value from a MAKI script, the size is read as a 16 bit integer, but it is then sign extended to 32 bits via movsx instruction. If the value is greater than 0x8000, then the sign extension results in a negative value. This negative value is then used in a memmove operation, resulting in a write to an invalid memory location.",
            "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution through SEH overwrite. The attacker can execute arbitrary code by controlling the exception handler.",
            "Attack vectors": "A malicious MAKI script file (e.g. mcvcore.maki) is crafted. When Winamp loads this file, it triggers the vulnerability.",
            "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to place a crafted MAKI script in a location Winamp loads from, typically a skin's script directory. No special privileges are needed."

           "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow vulnerability in the processing of MAKI scripts in Winamp.",
            "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer Overflow: When processing a string size within a MAKI script, if a size value greater than or equal to 0x8000 is encountered, the sign extension during the movsx instruction leads to an incorrect negative size being used in the memmove operation.",
            "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution, by overwriting the exception handlers to redirect execution to a shellcode controlled by the attacker. The crash occurs due to an attempt to write to an invalid memory location.",
            "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious MAKI script file with specific size values that trigger the integer overflow vulnerability. The user then needs to load this malformed file with Winamp.",
           "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to place a crafted .maki file in the Winamp skins directory, and then cause Winamp to load this malicious skin."

        {
            "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow when parsing MAKI script files.",
            "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer Overflow: The vulnerability lies in the way Winamp parses string sizes within MAKI script files. When a size value is read from the script, it's sign-extended using `movsx`, which can cause an integer overflow if the size is large enough (>= 0x8000). This overflow results in a negative size being used by `memmove` which attempts a memory write to a stack based location that the attacker can control.",
            "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary Code Execution: By exploiting the integer overflow to overwrite exception handlers on the stack, the attacker can gain control of the program's execution flow and run arbitrary code.",
            "Attack vectors": "A malicious crafted MAKI script file placed in the skin directory.",
            "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires local access to place the crafted MAKI script file within the Winamp's skin directory. No special privileges are required."

If the value read from the script is greater or equal to 0x8000, the movsx results in a negative value, leading to a memory overwrite when used in a subsequent memmove operation.",
