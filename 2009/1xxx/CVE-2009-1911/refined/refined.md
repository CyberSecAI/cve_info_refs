```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of the `lang` parameter in `/admin/_include/init.php`. This parameter is used to include language files, and if an attacker provides a malicious value, they can include arbitrary local files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI). The code uses `require` with a user-controlled path without proper sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files. This can lead to remote code execution if the attacker can control the contents of the included file or if they can include a file containing executable code (like the webserver log file, by poisoning the log with php code).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request, setting the `lang` parameter to a path that includes a file they wish to execute or use for code execution.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They also need `magic_quotes_gpc` to be disabled on the target server."
