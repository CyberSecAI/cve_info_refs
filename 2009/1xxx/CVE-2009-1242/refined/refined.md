  "CVE-2009-1242": {
    "description": "The vmx_set_msr function in arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the VMX implementation in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel on the i386 platform allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) by setting the EFER_LME (aka \"Long mode enable\") bit in the Extended Feature Enable Register (EFER) model-specific register, which is specific to the x86_64 platform.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `vmx_set_msr` function in the KVM subsystem's VMX implementation on i386 platforms incorrectly allows guest OS users to set the EFER_LME bit, which is intended for x86_64.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect access control",
        "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Guest OS users can trigger a denial of service (OOPS) on the host system.",
      "attack_vector": "Exploitation occurs from within a guest OS.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have control over a guest OS running on a vulnerable host. Specifically the attacker needs to be able to write to the EFER model-specific register",
