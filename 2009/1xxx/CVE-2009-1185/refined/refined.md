### Summary of CVE-2009-1185
The vulnerability lies in the udev daemon's improper validation of netlink message senders. A local attacker can exploit this by sending crafted netlink messages from userspace to gain root privileges.

**Root cause:**
- udev does not verify the origin of NETLINK messages, allowing messages from userspace to be processed as if they came from the kernel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Improper validation of netlink message senders.
- Missing check to ensure that netlink messages originate from kernel space.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation to root.
- Complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local attacker sends specially crafted netlink messages to udev.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user account on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is present in udev versions prior to 1.4.1.
- Some exploits leverage the `95-udev-late.rules` functionality to run arbitrary commands as root when a device is removed.
- Multiple distributions were affected including Ubuntu, Debian, Gentoo, and openSUSE.
- Fix involves adding a check for the origin of the netlink message.
