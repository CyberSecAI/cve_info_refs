How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : udev
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1185 CVE-2009-1186

Sebastian Kramer discovered two vulnerabilities in udev, the /dev and
hotplug management daemon.

CVE-2009-1185

    udev does not check the origin of NETLINK messages, allowing local
    users to gain root privileges.

CVE-2009-1186

    udev suffers from a buffer overflow condition in path encoding,
    potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.105-4etch1.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.125-7+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your udev package.

/*
 * cve-2009-1185.c
 *
 * udev < 141 Local Privilege Escalation Exploit
 * Jon Oberheide <jon@oberheide.org>
 * http://jon.oberheide.org
 *
 * Information:
 *
 *   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1185
 *
 *   udev before 1.4.1 does not verify whether a NETLINK message originates
 *   from kernel space, which allows local users to gain privileges by sending
 *   a NETLINK message from user space.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *   An alternate version of kcope's exploit.  This exploit leverages the
 *   95-udev-late.rules functionality that is meant to run arbitrary commands
 *   when a device is removed.  A bit cleaner and reliable as long as your
 *   distro ships that rule file.
 *
 *   Tested on Gentoo, Intrepid, and Jaunty.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   Pass the PID of the udevd netlink socket (listed in /proc/net/netlink,
 *   usually is the udevd PID minus 1) as argv[1].
 *
 *   The exploit will execute /tmp/run as root so throw whatever payload you
 *   want in there.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# udev: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200904-18**

Two errors in udev allow for a local root compromise and a Denial of
Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-fs/udev** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **124-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **124-r2** |

### Background

udev is the device manager used in the Linux 2.6 kernel series.

### Description

Sebastian Krahmer of SUSE discovered the following two vulnerabilities:

* udev does not verify the origin of NETLINK messages
  properly (CVE-2009-1185).
* A buffer overflow exists in the
  util\_path\_encode() function in lib/libudev-util.c (CVE-2009-1186).

### Impact

A local attacker could gain root privileges by sending specially
crafted NETLINK messages to udev or cause a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All udev users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-fs/udev-124-r2"
```
### References

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
Sebastian Krahmer of SUSE Security identified a problem in udevd with
handling of netlink messages.
Local attackers could inject netlink messages due to a missing origin
check where only the kernel should have been able to and so are able
to escalate privileges. (CVE-2009-1185)
Fixed packages have been released to address this issue for openSUSE
10.3-11.1, SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP2 and SUSE Linux Enterprise 11.
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 and Novell Linux Desktop 9 are not
affected by this problem.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the updated packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
None.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

5) Pending Vulnerabilities, Solutions, and Work-Arounds:
The fix for the buffer overflow in util\_path\_encode() (CVE-2009-1186)
has been postponed to a later udev release due to the urgency of the
netlink problem. It is also rated lower, since local users cannot directly
trigger the problematic code path.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

SUSE Security Announcement
Package: udev
Announcement ID: SUSE-SA:2009:025
Date: Wed, 22 Apr 2009 16:00:00 +0000

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
This update fixes a local privilege escalation in udev. We previously
released these updates and the advisory as SUSE-SA:2009:020 on
April 16.
Due to a mistake the patch fixing the security problem was not
applied to the udev package, and we did not spot this during the
release process due to use of a not fully functional proof of concept
exploit in QA.
Only SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP2 was missing the patch, the updated
udev packages of other products released on April 16 contain the fix.
The issue fixed:
CVE-2009-1185: udev did not check the origin of the netlink messages. A
local attacker could fake device create events and so gain root
privileges.
We thank SGI for reporting the missing patch problem to us.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please restart the udevd after applying the update, by doing:
/etc/init.d/boot.udev restart
Alternatively you can reboot the machine to be sure.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.
Our maintenance customers are notified individually. The packages are
offered for installation from the maintenance web:

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

The udev packages in Slackware 10.2, 11.0, 12.0, 12.1, 12.2, and -current contained a local root hole vulnerability:   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1185  The udev packages in Slackware 12.0, 12.1, 12.2, and -current had an integer overflow which could result in a denial of service:   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1186  Note that udev is only used with 2.6 kernels, which are not used by default with Slackware 10.2 and 11.0.   Here are the details from the Slackware 12.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/udev-141-i486-1_slack12.2.tgz:   Upgraded to udev-141.   This upgrade fixes a local root hole and a denial of service issue.

Give slackware.osuosl.org a try.  This is another primary FTP site for Slackware that can be considerably faster than downloading directly from ftp.slackware.com.  Thanks to the friendly folks at the OSU Open Source Lab (http://osuosl.org) for donating additional FTP and rsync hosting to the Slackware project!  :-)  Also see the "Get Slack" section on http://slackware.com for additional mirror sites near you.
