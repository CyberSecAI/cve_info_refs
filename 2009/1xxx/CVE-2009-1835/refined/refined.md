  "CVE-2009-1835": {
    "description": "Content loaded from a local file (file:/// URL) can read cookies from arbitrary domains. The domain name is calculated from the host portion of the URL, but the host name is ignored when loading content. For example, file://example.com/C:/foo.html will load foo.html from the local disk, but the domain will be example.com. If Firefox is configured as the default browser, remote HTML content served with \"Content-Disposition: attachment\" will be saved locally before being opened. When opened, the content can load itself and specify an arbitrary domain for the host name. Any currently readable cookies for the domain can be retrieved via 'document.cookie'.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the incorrect parsing of the host portion of file:// URLs. When loading content from a local file via file:/// URL, Firefox incorrectly calculates the domain name from the host portion of the URL, while ignoring the actual file path. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary domain in the file:/// URL, thus enabling access to cookies of the specified arbitrary domain. ",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect domain calculation from file:// URLs",
        "Failure to validate or sanitize the authority component of file:// URIs"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to cookies associated with an arbitrary domain, which could lead to session hijacking, account compromise, or data theft.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious HTML file with a `file://` URL and trick the user into opening it locally in Firefox. If Firefox is configured as the default browser, the content can also be served as an attachment, saved locally, and then opened.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted local HTML file with an arbitrary domain specified, by tricking a user to save it and open it locally, or through other social engineering techniques."
    },
    "additional_details": {
         "patch_details": "The fix silently drops an authority section in a file:/// uri. A new ParseAuthority() function was added for paranoia/future-proofing.",
        "fix_alternative" : "The authority could be dropped, and ParseAuthority can return an error making such URIs invalid.",
        "browser_behavior": "Safari leaves the ignored auth in the URL like we do (but unlike us doesn't use it as a host). IE (8) treats file:// the same as file:///, it does not treat the bit in-between as an authority."
