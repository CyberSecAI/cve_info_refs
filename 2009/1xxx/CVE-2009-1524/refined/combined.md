| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=499867#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-08 16:10:38 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned the identifiers [CVE-2009-1523](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1523) and [CVE-2009-1524](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1524) to the following vulnerabilities:  Name: [CVE-2009-1523](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1523) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1523> Assigned: 20090505 Reference: CONFIRM: <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-1004> Reference: CONFIRM: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/CRDY-7RKQCY> Reference: CERT-VN:VU#402580 Reference: URL: <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/402580> Reference: BID:34800 Reference: URL: <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/34800> Reference: SECUNIA:34975 Reference: URL: <http://secunia.com/advisories/34975>  Directory traversal vulnerability in the HTTP server in Mort Bay Jetty before 6.1.17, and 7.0.0.M2 and earlier 7.x versions, allows remote attackers to access arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in the URI.  Name: [CVE-2009-1524](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1524) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1524> Assigned: 20090505 Reference: CONFIRM: <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-980> Reference: BID:34800 Reference: URL: <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/34800> Reference: SECUNIA:34975 Reference: URL: <http://secunia.com/advisories/34975>  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Mort Bay Jetty before 6.1.17 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a directory listing request containing a ; (semicolon) character.   Note: it is unclear whether or not this affects jetty 5.x, which is the version that is included in Fedora.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=499867#c2)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-08 16:15:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 343124](attachment.cgi?id=343124&action=diff "upstream patch to fix CVE-2009-1523 in jetty 6.x") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=343124&action=edit "upstream patch to fix CVE-2009-1523 in jetty 6.x") upstream patch to fix [CVE-2009-1523](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1523) in jetty 6.x  Looking at the patch, I believe 5.x would be affected by this as well on a quick first glance.  I need to look at it a bit closer, but with some quick grepping, it looks like:  Response.java maps to servlet/ServletHttpResponse.java and possibly some duplicate code in servlet/Dispatcher.java.  The URIUtil.java maps to util/URI.java (thus changing all URIUtil.* functions to URI.*).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=499867#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-05-13 11:58:16 UTC  ``` For CVE-2009-1524:  Upstream issue description is here: <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-980>  According to comment from: <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-980?focusedCommentId=174717&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_174717>  patch from: <http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/attachment/41486/JETTY-980.patch>  is not needed and patch for: <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-1004>  sufficient to fix this issue (otherwise relevant file affected by this issue in jetty-5.1.14 is jetty-5.1.14/src/org/mortbay/util/Resource.java).  Provided PoC from <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-980> (part "Description" can be used for verification).  --  For [CVE-2009-1523](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1523), the patch and file, which needs to be patched are mentioned in previous comment.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=499867#c4)  Jeff Johnston    2009-05-13 20:15:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 343870](attachment.cgi?id=343870&action=diff "Proposed patch for jetty 5.1.14.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=343870&action=edit "Proposed patch for jetty 5.1.14.") Proposed patch for jetty 5.1.14.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=499867#c5)  Jeff Johnston    2009-05-13 20:51:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 343874](attachment.cgi?id=343874&action=diff "Proposed patch for jetty 5.1.14.") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=343874&action=edit "Proposed patch for jetty 5.1.14.") Proposed patch for jetty 5.1.14.  Fixed patch.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=499867#c6)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-19 20:38:41 UTC  ``` Jetty 5.1.15 has been released to correct the directory traversal issue (possibly the XSS issue, I'm awaiting confirmation on that since I can't seem to find a relevant CVS repository for Jetty 5.x):  <http://dist.codehaus.org/jetty/jetty-5.1.x/>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=499867#c9)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-22 19:26:40 UTC  ``` [CVE-2009-1523](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1523) was fixed in the upstream 5.1.15 release.  [CVE-2009-1524](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1524) has not been confirmed in Jetty 5.x by upstream; if it does affect Jetty 5.x it is not fixed.  Upstream's mitigation solution for [CVE-2009-1524](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1524) is to disable directory listings by setting dirAllowed to false in the webdefault.xml file, which we should do in Fedora since this should be only permitted by administrators as they need it, and not as a default anyways.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=499867#c10)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-22 19:27:09 UTC  ``` jetty-5.1.15-3.fc9 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 9. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/jetty-5.1.15-3.fc9>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=499867#c11)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-22 19:28:56 UTC  ``` jetty-5.1.15-3.fc10 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 10. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/jetty-5.1.15-3.fc10>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=499867#c12)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-22 19:58:56 UTC  ``` jetty-5.1.15-4.fc11 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 11. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/jetty-5.1.15-4.fc11>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=499867#c13)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-26 07:55:42 UTC  ``` jetty-5.1.15-3.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=499867#c14)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-26 07:56:12 UTC  ``` jetty-5.1.15-4.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.
