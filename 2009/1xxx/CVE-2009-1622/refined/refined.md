Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `order_sn` parameter within the `user.php` script of ECShop version 2.5.0.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application fails to sanitize user input within the `order_sn` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to potentially read sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and email addresses of administrators from the `ecs_admin_user` table.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessed via the HTTP GET request to the `user.php` script, specifically using the `act=order_query` parameter and injecting malicious SQL code into the `order_sn` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special privileges or authentication seems to be needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

* The provided exploit demonstrates how to extract administrator credentials using a `UNION SELECT` statement.
