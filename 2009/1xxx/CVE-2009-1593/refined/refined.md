The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in Armorlogic Profense Web Application Firewall. One of them is related to CVE-2009-1593.

**CVE-2009-1593**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the default negative model (blacklist approach) configuration of the Profense Web Application Firewall. The built-in core rules can be bypassed by exploiting the flexibility provided by HTML and JavaScript.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core rules of the web application firewall are not robust enough to prevent XSS attacks by using variations in the injected JavaScript close tag.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the protected web application, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This could lead to user data theft, session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the web application protected by Profense. Attackers inject XSS payloads into parameters of the request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests with XSS payloads to the targeted web application. They don't need a privileged position; they can be an external attacker.

The advisory also includes an example of the XSS payload used to bypass the Profense firewall:
