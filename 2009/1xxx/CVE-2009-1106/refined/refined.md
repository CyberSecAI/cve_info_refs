Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1106:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper parsing of `crossdomain.xml` files by the Java Plug-in within Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) versions 6 Update 12, 11, and 10. This improper parsing allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The Java Plug-in does not correctly validate the contents of `crossdomain.xml` files, leading to the bypass of intended security policies.
*   **Access Restriction Bypass:**  The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to circumvent the intended access restrictions imposed by the Java security model.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability could enable an attacker to:

*   **Connect to Arbitrary Sites:**  Bypass intended access restrictions, allowing connections to domains that would normally be prohibited.
*   **Potential Data Theft:** If the attacker establishes a connection with a malicious site, data could be compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Crossdomain.xml Manipulation:** Attackers can craft malicious `crossdomain.xml` files to trick the Java Plug-in.
*   **Unknown Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via unknown vectors related to how the `crossdomain.xml` is processed

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable system to initiate the attack.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability to craft a malicious `crossdomain.xml` file.
*   **User Interaction**: The user must load a page containing an applet that initiates the request.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects the Java Plug-in in JRE versions 6 Update 12, 11, and 10.
*   **IBM Java:** IBM Java is also vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:**  Applying the updates as listed by the vendors, restarting java processes after updates, and ensuring security best practices are followed.
*   **Vendor Advisories:**  Multiple vendor advisories exist (Red Hat, SUSE, HP, Vmware etc.)
*   **Multiple CVEs in related updates:** CVE-2009-1106 is often grouped with other CVEs related to various vulnerabilities discovered within Java at the time. These include buffer overflows in image processing, font handling, and other vulnerabilities related to security restrictions and file access.

**Summary:**
CVE-2009-1106 describes a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to bypass security access restrictions by leveraging a flaw in the parsing of `crossdomain.xml` files by the Java plugin. The vulnerability is related to how the Java plugin handles cross domain access requests, which is not correctly validated when the crossdomain.xml file is parsed. This vulnerability is rated as critical and requires updates to be made in the affected versions of the JRE.
