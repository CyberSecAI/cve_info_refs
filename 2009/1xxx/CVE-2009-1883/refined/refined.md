```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The z90crypt driver in the Linux kernel lacks a capability check for the Z90QUIESCE ioctl operation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Missing capability check in the z90crypt driver, specifically within the z90crypt_unlocked_ioctl function when handling the Z90QUIESCE command. This allows a local user with euid 0 (typically root privileges) to perform the Z90QUIESCE operation without proper authorization.

Impact of exploitation:
A local, unprivileged user can leverage euid 0 privileges to force a driver outage, leading to a denial of service. The Z90QUIESCE operation is intended to stop all new requests from being processed by the driver, essentially disabling it.

Attack vectors:
A local user can exploit this vulnerability by using the Z90QUIESCE ioctl on the z90crypt driver's device file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to execute code with euid 0. While the vulnerability is exploitable by a user with euid 0, the lack of proper capability checks enables bypassing of intended restrictions. Although the user might have root privileges, they may not have the intended capabilities.
