Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1534:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the Office Web Components ActiveX Control. This occurs when the control does not properly validate property values with boundary checks when used in Internet Explorer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow in the ActiveX control when handling property values. This lack of boundary checks allows more data to be written to a buffer than it can hold, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can achieve remote code execution by exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerability. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation can grant the attacker the same user rights as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    * Install programs
    * View, change, or delete data
    * Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Web Page:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a specially crafted web page designed to exploit the ActiveX control.
*   **Internet Explorer:** The vulnerability is exploited through Internet Explorer, which is used to render the malicious webpage containing the exploit.
*   **Compromised or Malicious Web Sites:** Attackers can host the malicious web page on their own websites or compromise existing websites to distribute the exploit.
*   **Email or Instant Messenger Links:** Attackers could trick users into visiting the malicious web page via links in email or instant messages.
*  **Banner Advertisements:** Attackers can also deliver the exploit via banner advertisements or other means of delivering web content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create or host a malicious web page.**
*   **Ability to induce victims to visit the malicious web page** (e.g., through social engineering, malicious links or compromised websites).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Microsoft Office Web Components ActiveX Control.
*   This vulnerability affects, among others:
   * Microsoft Office 2000 Web Components Service Pack 3
   * Microsoft Office XP Web Components Service Pack 3
   * Microsoft BizTalk Server 2002
   * Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 Service Pack 1
*   The provided content references several related vulnerabilities in Office Web Components (CVE-2009-0562, CVE-2009-2496, CVE-2009-1136), but it focuses on detailing CVE-2009-1534.
* The content provides a detailed explanation of workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability, such as setting the kill bit for the ActiveX control, unregistering the Office Web Components library, and restricting websites to only trusted sites.
*   The patch addresses the vulnerability by validating property values with boundary checks when the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer.
