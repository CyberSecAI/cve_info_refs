Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1707:

**Vulnerability:**

-   **Description**: "Reset Safari" may not immediately remove website passwords from memory. After clicking the "Reset" button for "Reset saved names and passwords" in the "Reset Safari..." menu option, Safari may take up to 30 seconds to clear the passwords.
-   **Root Cause:**  A race condition during the password clearing process causes a delay, making the passwords accessible for a short period.
-   **Weakness:** Insecure handling of stored credentials during the reset process. Specifically, the password clearing process doesn't happen instantaneously, and a delay makes the passwords accessible for a short period.
-  **Impact:** A user with access to the system during this time window (up to 30 seconds) may be able to access stored credentials.
-   **Attack Vector:** Requires local access to the system. An attacker would need physical access or the ability to remote control the user's session.
-   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Local access to a machine running Safari that has saved website passwords.
-   **Affected Systems:** Windows XP or Vista
