BTW that BID list of affected kernels isn't correct; the multibyte stuff
wasn't in <=2.6.18 at least.

I didn't check exactly where since it doesn't affect RHEL and didn't look
into the issue any further -- but on first glance it seemed like you'd
have to be a console user and display/select some carefully chosen
characters in order to do the overflow; so it's probably a 'local attacker
at keyboard' flaw?

Cheers, Mark

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : quagga
Vulnerability  : improper assertion
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian Bug     : 526311

It was discovered that Quagga, an IP routing daemon, could no longer
process the Internet routing table due to broken handling of multiple
4-byte AS numbers in an AS path.  If such a prefix is received, the
BGP daemon crashes with an assert failure, leading to a denial of
service.

The old stable distribution (etch) is not affected by this issue.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.10-1lenny2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.11-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your quagga package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## Details

NFS did not correctly handle races between fcntl and interrupts. A local

attacker on an NFS mount could consume unlimited kernel memory, leading to

a denial of service. Ubuntu 8.10 was not affected. ([CVE-2008-4307](/security/CVE-2008-4307))

Sparc syscalls did not correctly check mmap regions. A local attacker

could cause a system panic, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 8.10

was not affected. ([CVE-2008-6107](/security/CVE-2008-6107))

In certain situations, cloned processes were able to send signals to parent

processes, crossing privilege boundaries. A local attacker could send

arbitrary signals to parent processes, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2009-0028](/security/CVE-2009-0028))

The kernel keyring did not free memory correctly. A local attacker could

consume unlimited kernel memory, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2009-0031](/security/CVE-2009-0031))

The SCTP stack did not correctly validate FORWARD-TSN packets. A remote

attacker could send specially crafted SCTP traffic causing a system crash,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-0065](/security/CVE-2009-0065))

The eCryptfs filesystem did not correctly handle certain VFS return codes.

A local attacker with write-access to an eCryptfs filesystem could cause a

system crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-0269](/security/CVE-2009-0269))

The Dell platform device did not correctly validate user parameters. A

local attacker could perform specially crafted reads to crash the system,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-0322](/security/CVE-2009-0322))

The page fault handler could consume stack memory. A local attacker could

exploit this to crash the system or gain root privileges with a Kprobe

registered. Only Ubuntu 8.10 was affected. ([CVE-2009-0605](/security/CVE-2009-0605))

Network interfaces statistics for the SysKonnect FDDI driver did not check

capabilities. A local user could reset statistics, potentially interfering

with packet accounting systems. ([CVE-2009-0675](/security/CVE-2009-0675))

The getsockopt function did not correctly clear certain parameters. A local

attacker could read leaked kernel memory, leading to a loss of privacy.

([CVE-2009-0676](/security/CVE-2009-0676))

The ext4 filesystem did not correctly clear group descriptors when

resizing. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading

to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-0745](/security/CVE-2009-0745))

The ext4 filesystem did not correctly validate certain fields. A local

attacker could mount a malicious ext4 filesystem, causing a system

crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-0746](/security/CVE-2009-0746), [CVE-2009-0747](/security/CVE-2009-0747),

[CVE-2009-0748](/security/CVE-2009-0748))

The syscall interface did not correctly validate parameters when crossing

the 64-bit/32-bit boundary. A local attacker could bypass certain syscall

restricts via crafted syscalls. ([CVE-2009-0834](/security/CVE-2009-0834), [CVE-2009-0835](/security/CVE-2009-0835))

The shared memory subsystem did not correctly handle certain shmctl calls

when CONFIG\_SHMEM was disabled. Ubuntu kernels were not vulnerable, since

CONFIG\_SHMEM is enabled by default. ([CVE-2009-0859](/security/CVE-2009-0859))

The virtual consoles did not correctly handle certain UTF-8 sequences. A

local attacker on the physical console could exploit this to cause a system

crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-1046](/security/CVE-2009-1046))

The patch is now in mainline for 2.6.29, as
878b8619f711280fd05845e21956434b5e588cc4.

It appears to be applicable to earlier kernels as far back as 2.6.25
(at least).  But the -stable maintainers were not informed of this.

An appropriate way of flagging this is to add

Cc: <stable@...nel.org>

to the changelog.

Please, people - we all need to think about this, to prevent stuff from
falling through cracks.

Subject: [PATCH] Fix memory corruption in console selection

[ I don't know who is the console maintainer or if there is any, so I'm
posting this to Linus ]

Fix an off-by-two memory error in console selection.

The loop below goes from sel_start to sel_end (inclusive), so it writes
one more character. This one more character was added to the allocated
size (+1), but it was not multiplied by an UTF-8 multiplier.

This patch fixes a memory corruption when UTF-8 console is used and the
user selects a few characters, all of them 3-byte in UTF-8 (for example a
frame line).

When memory redzones are enabled, a redzone corruption is reported. When
they are not enabled, trashing of random memory occurs.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

                 CVE-2009-1439

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, privilege escalation or a sensitive
memory leak. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-0028

    Chris Evans discovered a situation in which a child process can
    send an arbitrary signal to its parent.

CVE-2009-0834

    Roland McGrath discovered an issue on amd64 kernels that allows
    local users to circumvent system call audit configurations which
    filter based on the syscall numbers or argument details.

CVE-2009-0835

    Roland McGrath discovered an issue on amd64 kernels with
    CONFIG_SECCOMP enabled. By making a specially crafted syscall,
    local users can bypass access restrictions.

CVE-2009-0859

    Jiri Olsa discovered that a local user can cause a denial of
    service (system hang) using a SHM_INFO shmctl call on kernels
    compiled with CONFIG_SHMEM disabled. This issue does not affect
    prebuilt Debian kernels.

CVE-2009-1046

    Mikulas Patocka reported an issue in the console subsystem that
    allows a local user to cause memory corruption by selecting a
    small number of 3-byte UTF-8 characters.

CVE-2009-1072

    Igor Zhbanov reported that nfsd was not properly dropping
    CAP_MKNOD, allowing users to create device nodes on file systems
    exported with root_squash.

CVE-2009-1184

    Dan Carpenter reported a coding issue in the selinux subsystem
    that allows local users to bypass certain networking checks when
    running with compat_net=1.

CVE-2009-1192

    Shaohua Li reported an issue in the AGP subsystem they may allow
    local users to read sensitive kernel memory due to a leak of
    uninitialized memory.

CVE-2009-1242

    Benjamin Gilbert reported a local denial of service vulnerability
    in the KVM VMX implementation that allows local users to trigger
    an oops.

CVE-2009-1265

    Thomas Pollet reported an overflow in the af_rose implementation
    that allows remote attackers to retrieve uninitialized kernel
    memory that may contain sensitive data.

CVE-2009-1337

    Oleg Nesterov discovered an issue in the exit_notify function that
    allows local users to send an arbitrary signal to a process by
    running a program that modifies the exit_signal field and then
    uses an exec system call to launch a setuid application.

CVE-2009-1338

    Daniel Hokka Zakrisson discovered that a kill(-1) is permitted to
    reach processes outside of the current process namespace.

CVE-2009-1439

    Pavan Naregundi reported an issue in the CIFS filesystem code that
    allows remote users to overwrite memory via a long
    nativeFileSystem field in a Tree Connect response during mount.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.26-15lenny2.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems, where applicable,
will be fixed in future updates to linux-2.6 and linux-2.6.24.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.

Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatability with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 5.0 (lenny)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.26-1um-2+15lenny2

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

Subject: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/33672/info kernel issue

Hi,

If you are wondering (like one of our customers)
<http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/33672/> seems to be this commit:
<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.28.y.git;a=commit;h=8255fc826e58c0a59711029e01db9fcdc06ba211>

Not sure if its exploitable though.

Ciao, Marcus

We backported Unicode stuff to SLES 10 I just see, but yes, 2.6.18 then.

Yes, console user only. And you can overflow 2 bytes over the end of kmalloced
space, not sure how much you can do with this.
