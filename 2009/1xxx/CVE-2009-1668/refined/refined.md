{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Error in handling the ABOR (Abort) FTP command.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to saturate the FTP service by sending a continuous stream of ABOR commands.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The FTP server becomes unresponsive and inaccessible for a prolonged period of time (potentially several days), leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is carried out remotely over the network using the FTP protocol.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable server and the ability to send FTP commands. They must also be able to authenticate using valid user/pass credentials."
