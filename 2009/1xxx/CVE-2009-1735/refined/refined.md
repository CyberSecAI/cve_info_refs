{
  "CVE-ID": "CVE-2009-1735",
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data through SQL injection. An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application via XSS and potentially perform actions on behalf of users or steal session cookies.",
  "Attack vectors": {
    "SQL Injection": "The `catid` parameter in the `listing_video.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate this parameter to execute arbitrary SQL queries.",
     "XSS": "The search form is vulnerable to XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed by users viewing the page."
  },
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. For XSS, the attacker needs to be able to input malicious javascript in the search form. For SQLi, the attacker has to input malicious SQL into the `catid` parameter. "
