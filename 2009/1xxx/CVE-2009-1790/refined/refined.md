Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the Trees web log system from CGI RESCUE.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the Trees web log system, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts. This is a classic example of a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the user's web browser. This could lead to various malicious activities including:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Stealing sensitive user information
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, as it involves injecting malicious scripts through HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- An attacker can craft malicious input (likely through URL parameters or form fields) that will be reflected back to the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Trees application.
- No authentication is required, meaning that the attacker can exploit the vulnerability without needing any user credentials.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to interact with a link or view a page containing the malicious script. This user interaction is considered "simple".
- Exploitation complexity is low, implying that little technical expertise is needed to execute the attack.
