  "CVE-2009-1885": {
    "description": "A stack overflow flaw was found in Apache Xerces by parsing root XML document element DTD definition. Providing a specially-crafted XML file would lead to excessive stack growth and denial of service (crash), when opened by a victim.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a recursive parsing of DTD structures within the `DTDScanner.cpp` file. The parser would recurse into itself when encountering nested parentheses in a content model which leads to stack exhaustion.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive stack growth leading to a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Parsing a specially crafted XML file containing recursively nested DTD content model definitions."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious XML document to the vulnerable XML parser.",
    "additional_details": "The fix involves an iterative approach to parsing DTD structures instead of the previous recursive method, thus preventing stack overflow.\nThe vulnerability was discovered by Jukka Taimisto and Rauli Kaksonen from the CROSS project at Codenomicon Ltd. and CERT-FI."
