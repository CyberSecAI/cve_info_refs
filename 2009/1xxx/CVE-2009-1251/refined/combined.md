How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# OpenAFS: Arbitrary code execution — GLSA **201101-05**

The cache manager of OpenAFS contains several bugs resulting in remote
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-fs/openafs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.9** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.9** |

### Background

OpenAFS is a distributed file system.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities were discovered:

* Simon Wilkinson discovered from a bug report by Toby Blake that the
  cache manager of OpenAFS contains a heap-based buffer overflow which is
  related to the use of the ERR\_PTR macro (CVE-2009-1250).
* A
  pointer dereference bug when using XDR arrays was discovered by Simon
  Wilkinson, with assistance from Derrick Brashear and Jeffrey Altman.
  (CVE-2009-1251).

### Impact

The vulnerabilities might allow remote unauthenticated attackers to
cause a Denial of Service (system crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenAFS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/openafs-1.4.9"
```
### References

Package        : openafs
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1250 CVE-2009-1251

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the client part of OpenAFS, a
distributed file system.

An attacker with control of a file server or the ability to forge RX
packets may be able to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode on an
OpenAFS client, due to a vulnerability in XDR array decoding.
(CVE-2009-1251)

An attacker with control of a file server or the ability to forge RX
packets may crash OpenAFS clients because of wrongly handled error
return codes in the kernel module. (CVE-2009-1250).

Note that in order to apply this security update, you must rebuild the
OpenAFS kernel module.  Be sure to also upgrade openafs-modules-source,
build a new kernel module for your system following the instructions in
/usr/share/doc/openafs-client/README.modules.gz, and then either stop
and restart openafs-client or reboot the system to reload the kernel
module.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.2-6etch2.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.7.dfsg1-6+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.10+dfsg1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
