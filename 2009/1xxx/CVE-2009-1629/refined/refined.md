Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the inadequate method used by AjaxTerm's `ajaxterm.js` script to generate session IDs. The script uses `Math.round(Math.random()*1000000000)` which doesn't produce a sufficiently random or unique identifier for user sessions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient entropy in session ID generation:** The use of JavaScript's `Math.random()` combined with `Math.round()` results in a predictable and easily brute-forceable session ID space.
*   **Client-side session ID generation:** Session IDs are generated on the client side, rather than on the server, making them more susceptible to manipulation and prediction.
*   **Lack of proper session management:** The session ID is the only identifier used to maintain user sessions, making it critical for security.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote session hijacking:** Attackers can brute-force the limited space of possible session ID values and hijack existing user connections to the web terminal.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can exhaust available session IDs through brute-force attempts, potentially disrupting service and consuming system resources.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based brute-force:** An attacker attempts to guess valid session IDs by making numerous requests to the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the AjaxTerm server.
*   **Knowledge of the session ID generation algorithm:** While relatively simple, the attacker needs to know or deduce how the session ID is generated.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects AjaxTerm versions 0.10 and earlier.
*   The advisory notes that the project appears unmaintained.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Michael Greb.
*   oCERT assigned the identifier oCERT-2009-004 to this vulnerability.
*   CVE-2009-1629 was assigned to this vulnerability after the initial advisory release
