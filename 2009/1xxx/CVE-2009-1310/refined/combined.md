How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research).

... assuming they can convince the user to also complete an empty search (pressing enter into the search bar with no text entered), since that's the only time we use the SearchForm value.
But yeah, we should filter the SearchForm value the same way we already filter templateURI and the IconURL.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: true

"moderate", really? An untrustworthy search plugin can already snoop on all your searches and potentially return hacked results which seems much more reliably bad than hoping you accidentally do a blank search on an interesting site. But it just sits there waiting and you only have to make that mistake once; OK, I'll buy "moderate".

If the fix is as trivial as [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=483086#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - non-http[s] SearchForm URIs should be ignored (possible XSS if a malicious search plugin is installed)") implies we'd really like a patch in 1.9.0.8 -- but code-freeze is tomorrow night (Mar 17) so we'd need a reviewed patch ASAP to approve.

Attached patch

[Patch](attachment.cgi?id=367754&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=367754&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=483086&attachment=367754)

This patch quietly drops SearchForms which aren't http(s). I've gone the quiet route because it's the most self-contained for a branch landing and will protect, but not outright break users who may have plugins containing SearchForms with invalid schemes already installed (plus I don't need to stub out prompts to test it).
The tests are in browser/ to make them easier to add to 1.9.0, I'll be sure to add them to the search test suite so they get migrated over to toolkit for 1.9.1+.

Can \_name really be null here?
Should the cache switch to setting/saving \_\_searchForm rather than going through the setter each time? I suppose that would require a version bump...
I still think we should try to consolidate the scheme filtering for template/iconURI/searchForm, get a followup filed on that perhaps?

Yeah, during parsing if SearchForm comes before ShortName in the description.

I'll change it do that and bump the cache version on checkin.

Sure, I left it out of this version because of the different scheme requirements for each, but I'll file a bug to see if we can't change that.

On which machine the mochitests will be run? I'm not able to find the results. It's not the unit test one...

It's not a mochitest, it's a browser chrome test. It runs on the normal unit test machines, e.g.:
<http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showlog.cgi?log=Firefox/1237468237.1237475679.27591.gz&fulltext=1>
Search for "chrome://mochikit/content/browser/browser/components/search/test/browser\_483086.js".

For 1.8 line it affects only firefox, right? Seamonkey looks safe.

AFAIK SeaMonkey doesn't use this code at all, on any branch.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1886-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
September 14, 2009                    <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>

Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1310 CVE-2009-3079

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceweasel web
browser, an unbranded version of the Firefox browser. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-3079

   "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that a programming error in the FeedWriter
   module could lead to the execution of Javascript code with elevated
   privileges.

CVE-2009-1310

   Prateek Saxena discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
   the MozSearch plugin interface.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.6-3.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.14-1.

For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- MozillaFirefox/mozilla-xulrunner190
Firefox version upgrade to 3.0.9 to fix various security bugs.
(CVE-2009-1302,CVE-2009-1303,CVE-2009-1304,CVE-2009-1305,CVE-2009-1306,
CVE-2009-1307,CVE-2009-1308,CVE-2009-1309,CVE-2009-1310,CVE-2009-1311,
CVE-2009-1312,CVE-2009-0652)
Affected products: SLES 11, openSUSE 11.0-11.1
- apport
The apport crash watcher / handler suite contains a cron job that
cleanes the world writeable /var/crash directory unsafely, allowing
local attackers to remove random files on the system. (CVE-2009-1295)
This update fixes this.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- evolution
camel's NTLM SASL authentication mechanism as used by evolution
did not properly validate server's challenge packets (CVE-2009-0582).

- Fixes a critical crasher in mailer component.
- Fixes creation of recurrence monthly items in GroupWise.
- Includes fixes for some usability issues.
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- freetype2
Freetype was updated to fix some integer overflows that can be exploited
remotely in conjunction with programs like a web-browser.
(CVE-2009-0946)
Thanks to Tavis Ormandy who found the bugs.
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- java-1\_4\_2-ibm/IBMJava2
This update brings IBM Java 1.4.2 to Service Release 13.
It fixes lots of bugs and following security issues:
CVE-2008-3104: Security vulnerabilities in the Java
Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet that is
loaded from a remote system to circumvent network access
restrictions and establish socket connections to certain
services running on the local host, as if it were loaded
from the system that the applet is running on. This may
allow the untrusted remote applet the ability to exploit
any security vulnerabilities existing in the services it
has connected to.
CVE-2008-3112: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create arbitrary files with the
permissions of the user running the untrusted Java Web
Start application.
CVE-2008-3113: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create or delete arbitrary files with
the permissions of the user running the untrusted Java
Web Start application.
CVE-2008-3114: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to
determine the location of the Java Web Start cache.
CVE-2008-5350: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or
application to list the contents of the home directory of
the user running the applet or application.
CVE-2008-5346: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an
untrusted applet or application to read arbitrary memory
locations in the process that the applet or application is
running in.
CVE-2008-5343: A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java
Plug-in may allow hidden code on a host to make network
connections to that host and to hijack HTTP sessions using
cookies stored in the browser.
CVE-2008-5344: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with applet classloading may allow an
untrusted applet to read arbitrary files on a system that
the applet runs on and make network connections to hosts
other than the host it was loaded from.
CVE-2008-5359: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow
an untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges.
For example, an untrusted applet may grant itself
permissions to read and write local files or execute local
applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5339: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java Web Start
application to make network connections to hosts other than
the host that the application is downloaded from.
CVE-2008-5340: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with launching Java Web Start applications may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted application may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted application.
CVE-2008-5348: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with authenticating users through
Kerberos may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) to the
system as a whole, due to excessive consumption of
operating system resources.
CVE-2008-2086: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow
certain trusted operations to be performed, such as
modifying system properties.
CVE-2008-5345: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows
code loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost.
This may allow code that is maliciously placed on the local
filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network
access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed if
the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be
leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains
that map a name to the localhost).
CVE-2008-5351: The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8)
decoder in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts
encodings that are longer than the "shortest" form. This
behavior is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may
be leveraged to exploit systems running software that
relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form
sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be
decoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that
are not otherwise accessible to be read, if the URIs are
not checked following UTF-8 decoding.
CVE-2008-5360: The Java Runtime Environment creates
temporary files with insufficiently random names. This may
be leveraged to write JAR files which may then be loaded as
untrusted applets and Java Web Start applications to access
and provide services from localhost and hence steal cookies.
CVE-2008-5353: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects
may allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5356: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5354: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java
application that is launched through the command line to
escalate privileges. For example, the untrusted Java
application may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are
accessible to the user running the untrusted Java
application.
This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or
Java Web Start application.
CVE-2008-5357: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5342: A security vulnerability in the the Java Web
Start BasicService allows untrusted applications that are
downloaded from another system to request local files to be
displayed by the browser of the user running the untrusted
application.
Affected products: SUSE CORE 9, SLE 10
- kdegraphics3
This update fixes security problems while decoding JBIG2.
(CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-0165, CVE-2009-0166,
CVE-2009-0799, CVE-2009-0800, CVE-2009-1179, CVE-2009-1180,
CVE-2009-1181, CVE-2009-1182, CVE-2009-1183)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libopenssl-devel/openssl/compat-openssl097g
This update of openssl fixes the following problems:
- CVE-2009-0590: ASN1\_STRING\_print\_ex() function allows remote denial
of service
- CVE-2009-0591: CMS\_verify() function allows signatures to look valid
- CVE-2009-0789: denial of service due to malformed ASN.1 structures
Affected products: SLES 9, SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libsoup
Large strings could lead to a heap overflow in the base64 encoding and
decoding functions. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0585).
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, POS 9, OES, SLES 9, SLE 10
- opensc/libopensc2
Private data objects on smartcards initialized with OpenSC could be
accessed without authentication (CVE-2009-0368).
Only blank cards initialized with OpenSC are affected by this
problem. Affected cards need to be manually fixed, updating the
opensc package alone is not sufficient!
Please carefully read and follow the instructions on the following
web site if you are using PIN protected private data objects on
smart cards other than Oberthur, and you have initialized those
cards using OpenSC:
<http://en.opensuse.org/Smart_Cards/Advisories>
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- python-crypto
Missing checks for the key length in the ARC2 module potentially allowed
attackers to crash applications using python-crypto or potentially even
cause execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0544).
Affected products: SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- unbound
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow in the
ldns\_rr\_new\_frm\_str\_internal()
function. This allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
DNS resource record (RR) with a long class field and possibly TTL field.
(CVE-2009-1086)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could lead to crashes, make the viewer
run into an infinite loop or potentially even allow execution of
arbitrary code.
(CVE-2009-0165, CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-0147, CVE-2009-0166,
CVE-2009-0799, CVE-2009-0800, CVE-2009-1179, CVE-2009-1180,
CVE-2009-1181, CVE-2009-1182, CVE-2009-1183)

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-20

## Malicious search plugins can inject code into arbitrary sites

Announced
April 21, 2009
Reporter
Prateek Saxena
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.9

### Description

Security researcher **Prateek Saxena** reported that a
malicious MozSearch plugin could be created using a javascript: URI in
the `SearchForm` value. This URI is used as the default
landing page when an empty search is performed. If an attacker could
get a user to install the malicious plugin and perform an empty
search, the `SearchForm` javascript: URI would be executed
within the context of the currently open page.
