| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=46949#c0)  Sander de Boer    2009-04-01 01:22:39 UTC  ``` I have upgraded my apache 2.2.6 box with the _prefork_ mpm to apache 2.2.11 with the _worker_ mpm. It's a reverse proxy for 2 backend tomcat(ajp) servers. Apache is also used as balancer.  <Proxy balancer://patmos>   BalancerMember ajp://tomcat2:8009 route=mmbase01 min=5 smax=10 max=15   BalancerMember ajp://tomcat1:8009 route=mmbase02 min=5 smax=10 max=15 </Proxy>  Since this upgrade apache serves sometimes wrong content. It seems that the served content comes from another thread. Something like a thread-safe problem.  After this upgrade I tried figure out what the problem is. A downgrade to 2.2.6 with _worker_ mpm resolve the problem. After that I upgraded to 2.2.10 without problems again.  My conclusion: This bug is introduced in 2.2.11. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=46949#c1)  Ruediger Pluem    2009-04-01 08:10:56 UTC  ``` Please provide  - A small test case including a small web application and a request that shows the behaviour - The Tomcat version you are using and what kind of Tomcat connector you are using - What clients trigger this issue (e.g. which browser, is it a POST or a GET request) - A network sniff that exposes the problem ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=46949#c2)  Ruediger Pluem    2009-04-01 08:13:34 UTC  ``` Please provide the lines in the error log file containing proxy: ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=46949#c3)  Rainer Jung    2009-04-02 14:34:25 UTC  ``` Since this seems to be difficult to reproduce in general, and it's easy for you, could you please confirm, that your 2.2.10 and 2.2.11 tests were done on the same systems, using the same backends, both versions using worker MPM, same version of the APR libraries and same configuration?  If yes, then it should be interesting to redo the tests with  - httpd 2.2.10 using mod_proxy, mod_proxy_ajp and mod_proxy_balancer from 2.2.11 - the other way round, using httpd 2.2.11 and the proxy modules from 2.2.10  As far as I can see, the mixed environments should work in principle. In case the problem shows only up with one of the two combinations we would know, whether the root cause is in the core or the proxy modules.  Of course the info requested in comments #1 and #2 will be very helpful as well. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=46949#c4)  Sander de Boer    2009-04-03 04:26:20 UTC  ``` I am using apache-tomcat-6.0.16 with the following connector:   <Connector port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="443" maxThreads="512" enableLookups="false" />  This bug is hard to reproduce. It seems that this is only a problem onder load. Even on a test envoirement I can't reproduce it.  Because many of our clients complain to this issue, I set up a wget loop that downloaded a test.jsp containing the word 'hello'. In this way I saw there was sometimes other content downloaded than the word 'hello'.  I think that the errors in the error log are not related to this issue, because the time doesnt match: [Sun Mar 29 16:35:00 2009] [error] proxy: read zero bytes, expecting 1902 bytes [Sun Mar 29 16:38:03 2009] [error] proxy: read zero bytes, expecting 1902 bytes [Sun Mar 29 16:51:49 2009] [error] proxy: read zero bytes, expecting 1902 bytes  I will try a mixed version of .10 and .11, but first weekend! ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=46949#c5)  Ruediger Pluem    2009-04-08 14:12:15 UTC  ``` Committed a fix to trunk ([r763394](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=763394)) that was tested successfully by Sander. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=46949#c6)  Ruediger Pluem    2009-04-08 14:26:30 UTC  ``` A patch for 2.2.11 can be also found in some hours at the mirrors and at <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.2.11> ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=46949#c7)  Jakob Ericsson    2009-04-17 00:22:45 UTC  ``` We are experiencing the same problem on Windows 2003 server (httpd 2.2.11). Will patch be available in 2.2.12? ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=46949#c8)  Ruediger Pluem    2009-04-25 02:59:23 UTC  ``` Backport to 2.2.x as [r768506](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=768506). ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=46949#c9)  Daniele    2017-05-09 15:45:01 UTC  ``` Can you confirm that this problem has been fixed on Apache 2.4.x? Many thanks! ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Apache: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200907-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP daemon allow for local
privilege escalation, information disclosure or Denial of Service attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.11-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.11-r2** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Apache HTTP
server:

* Jonathan Peatfield reported that the
  "Options=IncludesNoEXEC" argument to the "AllowOverride" directive is
  not processed properly (CVE-2009-1195).
* Sander de Boer
  discovered that the AJP proxy module (mod\_proxy\_ajp) does not correctly
  handle POST requests that do not contain a request body
  (CVE-2009-1191).
* The vendor reported that the HTTP proxy
  module (mod\_proxy\_http), when being used as a reverse proxy, does not
  properly handle requests containing more data as stated in the
  "Content-Length" header (CVE-2009-1890).
* Francois Guerraz
  discovered that mod\_deflate does not abort the compression of large
  files even when the requesting connection is closed prematurely
  (CVE-2009-1891).

### Impact

A local attacker could circumvent restrictions put up by the server
administrator and execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the
user running the Apache server. A remote attacker could send multiple
requests to a server with the AJP proxy module, possibly resulting in
the disclosure of a request intended for another client, or cause a
Denial of Service by sending specially crafted requests to servers
running mod\_proxy\_http or mod\_deflate.

### Workaround

Remove "include", "proxy\_ajp", "proxy\_http" and "deflate" from
APACHE2\_MODULES in make.conf and rebuild Apache, or disable the
aforementioned modules in the Apache configuration.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.2.11-r2"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

## Details

Matthew Palmer discovered an underflow flaw in apr-util as included in

Apache. An attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash

in Apache using a crafted SVNMasterURI directive, .htaccess file, or when

using mod\_apreq2. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS. ([CVE-2009-0023](/security/CVE-2009-0023))

Sander de Boer discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp would reuse connections when

a client closed a connection without sending a request body. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive response data. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-1191](/security/CVE-2009-1191))

Jonathan Peatfield discovered that Apache did not process Includes options

correctly. With certain configurations of Options and AllowOverride, a

local attacker could use an .htaccess file to override intended

restrictions and execute arbitrary code via a Server-Side-Include file.

This issue affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2009-1195](/security/CVE-2009-1195))

It was discovered that the XML parser did not properly handle entity

expansion. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service via memory

resource consumption by sending a crafted request to an Apache server

configured to use mod\_dav or mod\_dav\_svn. This issue only affected Ubuntu

6.06 LTS. ([CVE-2009-1955](/security/CVE-2009-1955))

C. Michael Pilato discovered an off-by-one buffer overflow in apr-util when

formatting certain strings. For big-endian machines (powerpc, hppa and

sparc in Ubuntu), a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or

information disclosure leak. All other architectures for Ubuntu are not

considered to be at risk. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS.

([CVE-2009-1956](/security/CVE-2009-1956))
