Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1579:

**CVE-2009-1579**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `map_yp_alias` function in `functions/imap_general.php` of SquirrelMail. This function, when enabled, uses the `ypmatch` program to map usernames. The vulnerability occurs because user-controlled data is passed unsanitized to the `ypmatch` command, allowing an attacker to inject shell metacharacters.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Server-Side Code Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary server-side code due to the lack of input sanitization.
    *   **Command Injection:** Specifically, the vulnerability is a command injection issue due to the insecure use of shell metacharacters.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the webserver user. This can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Attack:** The attack is carried out remotely by sending specially crafted username strings to the vulnerable SquirrelMail server.
    *   **`map_yp_alias` Function:** The attack targets systems where the non-default `map_yp_alias` function is enabled for username mapping.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the SquirrelMail server.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the `map_yp_alias` configuration requirement and the possibility of injecting shell metacharacters.
    *   **Authentication (potentially):** While not explicitly stated, depending on the configuration, the attacker might need to send the malicious input as part of the login process, which would require some level of authentication knowledge.

**Summary of Information from Different Sources:**

*   **support.apple.com:** This source lists CVE-2009-1579 within a larger list of security updates, indicating that the vulnerability affects older versions of Mac OS X.
*   **bugzilla.redhat.com:** This source provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including a description of the vulnerable function and the attack vector. It also mentions that the issue was addressed in a Red Hat security advisory.
*   **debian.org:** This source confirms the vulnerability and its severity, also mentioning the affected package versions in Debian and the fixes in specific versions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability requires the non-default `map_yp_alias` configuration to be enabled, which reduces the attack surface.
*   The root cause, shell metacharacter injection, is a classic security vulnerability.
*   Multiple sources mention the fix involves sanitizing the input to prevent command injection.
