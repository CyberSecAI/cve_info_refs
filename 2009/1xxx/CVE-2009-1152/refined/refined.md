Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Gigaset SE461 WiMAX router restarts when a TCP connection is established and closed on port 53 from the LAN interface. Additionally, specific HTML tags can trigger the same behavior if they attempt to load resources from the router's port 53.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. The router becomes unavailable after a successful attack, which can be triggered by a crafted TCP connection or specific HTML tags.
- The issue is caused by a lack of proper handling of TCP connections to port 53 and resource requests, which causes the router to restart.
- The vulnerability is exploitable through a web browser that doesn't restrict connections to port 53, such as Internet Explorer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a Denial of Service (DoS).
- In some cases, exploiting this vulnerability through the web interface could lead to the loss of WAN configuration settings (IP, gateway IP, DNS servers), requiring a hardware reset.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct TCP connection: Establishing a TCP connection on port 53 of the router from the LAN and then closing it.
- Crafted web content: Embedding specific HTML tags (e.g., `<img>`, `<link>`, `<base>`) in a webpage that references the router's IP address and port 53. This can be done by tricking a user within the LAN segment into opening the crafted webpage using a vulnerable browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the vulnerable router to directly connect via TCP or trick a user to open the malicious HTML.
- The attacker needs a web browser with no security restrictions on connecting to port 53 to perform web based attacks, Internet Explorer is specifically named as being vulnerable.
