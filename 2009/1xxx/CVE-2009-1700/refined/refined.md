  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1700",
    "description": "WebKit does not properly handle redirects when processing Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT). This allows a maliciously crafted website to retrieve XML content from pages on other websites, which could result in the disclosure of sensitive information. This update addresses the issue by ensuring that documents referenced in transformations are downloaded from the same domain as the transformation itself.",
    "affected_components": [
      "WebKit"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Improper handling of redirects in XSLT processing.",
    "vulnerability": "WebKit does not validate the domain from which resources are loaded during XSLT transformations when redirects are involved.",
    "impact": "A maliciously crafted website can retrieve XML content from other websites by exploiting the improper handling of redirects during XSLT processing, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "attack_vector": "Visiting a maliciously crafted website.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to host a malicious website."
