{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of a limit on the depth of XML tree parsing, which can lead to a stack overflow due to excessive recursion during frame construction and layout.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unbounded recursion in XML parsing",
      "Lack of depth limitation in XML tree processing"
    ],
    "impact": "A denial-of-service (DoS) condition can be triggered by providing a specially crafted XML file with an extremely deep tree structure, causing the browser to crash due to a stack overflow. This affects Firefox, Internet Explorer and Opera.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Loading a malicious XML file through direct navigation",
       "Embedding the malicious XML file via an iframe"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to serve or provide an XML document. The attacker position can be remote, since the victim will open the attacker-controlled XML document in their browser.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing phase of an XML document with deep nesting."
  }
