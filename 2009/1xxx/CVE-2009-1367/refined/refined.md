The provided content is related to CVE-2009-1367.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `moziloCMS` application. This leads to multiple vulnerabilities: Local File Inclusion (LFI), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Path Disclosure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `page` parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable to LFI, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem by using directory traversal sequences like `../`.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `query` parameter in `index.php` when `action=search` is vulnerable to XSS, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.
- **Path Disclosure:** The application discloses the full server path via several parameters, including `gal[]` in `gallery.php`, `page[]` and `cat[]` in `index.php`, and `file[]` in `download.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **LFI:**  An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files (e.g. `logindata.conf`) or other system files (e.g. `BOOTSECT.BAK`).
- **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Path Disclosure:** An attacker can gather information about the server's filesystem, which could be useful for further attacks or exploit development.

**Attack vectors:**
- **LFI:** By manipulating the `page` parameter in the `index.php` URL with directory traversal sequences and a null byte terminator (`%00`).
- **XSS:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `query` parameter of the `index.php` URL.
- **Path Disclosure:** By providing an array value to the vulnerable parameters `gal[]` in `gallery.php`, `page[]` and `cat[]` in `index.php`, and `file[]` in `download.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `moziloCMS` application.
- No special privileges or authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
