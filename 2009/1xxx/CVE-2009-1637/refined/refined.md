### Content relates to CVE-2009-1637
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Simple Customer 1.3 application, where the admin password can be changed arbitrarily.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper authorization or validation controls, allowing an attacker to directly modify the administrator's password without needing prior authentication or knowledge of the existing password.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to change the administrator's password, leading to complete compromise of the application's administrative functions. This would grant the attacker full control over the application and its data.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a web-based request, specifically a POST request to the `profile.php` page with crafted parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required.
