```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes a file specified by the `$_page_content` parameter without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, they can inject and execute malicious scripts in the user's browser.",
  "Attack vectors": {
        "RFI": "By manipulating the `_page_content` parameter in the `theme/format.php` file with a URL to an attacker-controlled file.",
        "XSS": "By injecting a malicious script within the `startpage.php` via the URL."
    },
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required."
