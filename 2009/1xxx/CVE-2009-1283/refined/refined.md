  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to improper sanitization of the session ID obtained from a cookie before using it in an SQL query within the `SESS_updateSessionTime` function in `/private/system/lib-session.php`. When the session ID is not MD5 hashed (default configuration), the `sess_id` parameter in the SQL query is directly concatenated without proper sanitization, leading to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL injection vulnerability in `SESS_updateSessionTime` function due to lack of proper sanitization of session ID from cookie.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could allow them to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, modify database entries, or potentially compromise the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP cookie, specifically the `glf_session` cookie, which contains malicious SQL code. This cookie is sent to the server, where the vulnerable code processes it without proper sanitization.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a crafted cookie. The attacker also needs to have knowledge of a valid session id (which can be obtained by creating a new user account) to bypass the initial query in `SESS_getUserIdFromSession()`."
