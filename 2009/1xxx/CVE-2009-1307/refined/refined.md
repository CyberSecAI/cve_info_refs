{
  "CVE-2009-1307": {
    "root_cause": "The Adobe Flash plugin miscalculates the origin of content loaded from the 'view-source:' protocol handler, treating it as local content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Bypass of Flash's 'crossdomain.xml' security policy.",
      "Ability to read and write local shared objects (LSO) within the 'localhost' context."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass Flash's network security policy, gain access to arbitrary third-party web content and read/write local shared objects (LSO), potentially leading to complete privacy compromise and user tracking.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Loading a Flash file within a 'view-source:' context using a crafted JAR file.",
      "Coordinating third-party sites to read and write LSOs and posting that information back."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have control over a web server to host a malicious jar file and a third-party web page for a coordinated attack."
