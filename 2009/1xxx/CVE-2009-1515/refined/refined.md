Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1515:

**CVE-2009-1515** is related to multiple vulnerabilities discovered in the `file` utility (specifically in `libmagic`) prior to version 5.04-1, which could lead to crashes and other issues in applications relying on it, such as `amavisd-new`.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root causes include:
*   **Version Mismatch:**  Incompatibility between the compiled magic file (`magic.mgc`) and the version of the `file` utility itself. This leads to errors in applications relying on `file` to determine file types (as observed in the `amavisd-new` logs).
*   **Heap Corruption:** Out-of-bounds read errors within the `cdf.c` file while parsing Compound Document File (CDF) formatted files (such as Microsoft Office files .doc, .mpp and .msi).
* **Assertion Failure:**  An assertion failure in `cdf_read_sat` related to reading Sector Allocation Table entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Version Dependency Issues:** A mismatch between the magic file's format version and the file utility's version.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Heap corruption vulnerability arising from out-of-bounds reads while parsing CDF files.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Insufficient checks when parsing CDF structures could lead to out-of-bounds reads and crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Crashes:** The vulnerabilities caused crashes in the `file` utility and in applications that use it, such as `amavisd-new`.
*   **Service Disruption:** In the case of `amavisd-new`, this led to the inability to process emails, causing a service disruption.
*  **Denial of Service:** Heap corruption can lead to program termination and can be triggered remotely, causing denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by supplying specially crafted files (e.g., .doc, .mpp, .msi) to the `file` utility for analysis.
*   **Email Processing:**  Email attachments with malicious or large CDF files (such as .doc files, .msi installers) can trigger the vulnerability when scanned by `amavisd-new` using the vulnerable `file` utility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted file to the `file` utility, either directly or indirectly through an application that uses it.
*   For a practical exploitation affecting email servers using `amavisd-new`, the attacker needs to send the specially crafted files as attachments.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue with the `file` utility and `amavisd-new` was resolved by downgrading to file version 4.26-2 or upgrading to a version that fixed the bug.
*   The heap corruption was discovered while processing Microsoft document files.
*   The reports indicate that the size of the input files may have played a role in triggering the issues, with larger files more likely to cause problems.
*   The Debian bug reports highlight different issues of the same vulnerability, which is further resolved by upgrading to version `5.04-1`.
