- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure cookie handling. The application does not properly secure or validate cookies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the application's handling of the `userid` cookie. It appears that setting the `userid` cookie to `1` with a path of `/` allows an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  By manipulating the `userid` cookie, an attacker might be able to bypass authentication or gain elevated privileges. The exploit allows modification of a user's session, possibly gaining administrative access.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is through client-side manipulation of cookies using JavaScript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript on the client side, which could happen through various attack scenarios, including XSS or by directly manipulating the browser.
