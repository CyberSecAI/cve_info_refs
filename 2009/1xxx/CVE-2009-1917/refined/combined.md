# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 â Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 â Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 â Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 â Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products.Â Likewise, theÂ rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.Â Â In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."Â  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 isÂ â2âÂ and the rating for Windows 7 isÂ â1â, the rating will reflect â1â.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** â A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** â The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security updateâs release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month â thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

# Microsoft Updates for Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedJanuary 24, 2013
Alert CodeTA09-195A

### Systems Affected

* Microsoft Windows and Windows Server
* Microsoft DirectShow
* Microsoft Virtual PC and Server
* Microsoft Office Publisher
* Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server

### Overview

Microsoft has released updates that address vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, DirectShow, Virtual PC and Server, Office Publisher, and ISA Server.

As part of the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for July 2009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-jul.mspx), Microsoft has released updates that address several vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, DirectShow, Windows Virtual PC and Server, Office Publisher, and ISA Server. Microsoft indicates that two of these vulnerabilities, [CVE-2009-1537](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1537) and [CVE-2008-0015](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0015), are being actively exploited.

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code, gain elevated privileges, or cause a vulnerable application to crash.

### Solution

Microsoft has provided updates for these vulnerabilities in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for July 2009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-jul.mspx). The security bulletin describes any known issues related to the updates. Administrators are encouraged to note these issues and test for any potentially adverse effects. Administrators should consider using an automated update distribution system such as Windows Server Update Services ([WSUS](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/wsus/default.aspx)).

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-034 - Critical

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (972260)

Published: July 28, 2009 | Updated: August 04, 2009

**Version:** 2.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update is being released out of band in conjunction with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131), which describes vulnerabilities in those components and controls that have been developed using vulnerable versions of the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL). As a defense-in-depth measure, this Internet Explorer security update helps mitigate known attack vectors within Internet Explorer for those components and controls that have been developed with vulnerable versions of ATL as described in [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882) and Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131).

This security update also resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 5.01 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, running on supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000; Critical for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 running on supported editions of Windows XP; Critical for Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 running on supported editions of Windows Vista; Moderate for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 running on supported editions of Windows Server 2003; and Moderate for Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 running on supported editions of Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory and table operations. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.**Â The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.**Â [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 972260](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/972260) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The software listed here have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on August 4, 2009?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to reissue the Korean-language update for Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4. All customers who have already installed the original update for Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 are already protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin. However, some printing issues remain after installing the original update on the Korean-language version of Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1; see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 972260](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/972260) for this known issue. Therefore, customers who have the Korean-language version of Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 may reinstall the update for Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on their Windows 2000 systems to have the same protections and also resolve the printing issues. If reinstalling, it is not necessary to first uninstall the original update of Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 that has been applied.

This reissued update creates a log file, KB972260-IE6SP1-20090730.120000.log, and requires the verification key, HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Internet Explorer 6\SP1\KB972260-IE6SP1-20090730.120000\Filelist.

With this revision, we are also taking the opportunity to remove two erroneous references to Internet Explorer 8. One was in the Affected Software table, listing an update for Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems and Windows Server 2008 for Itanium-based Systems Service Pack 2. The other was in the Non-Affected Software table, listing Internet Explorer 8 on Windows 7 for Itanium-based Systems.

**Why was this security update released out of band?**

This security update is being released out of band to address issues disclosed in [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882), "Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) Could Allow Remote Code Execution."

**Is this security bulletin related to MS09-035, that is also being released out-of-band?**

Yes. Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131) describes vulnerabilities in those components and controls that have been developed using vulnerable public versions of the Active Template Library (ATL). As a defense-in-depth measure, this security update (MS09-034) helps mitigate known attack vectors within Internet Explorer for those components and controls that have been developed with the versions of ATL described in [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882) and MS09-035.

**Is this security bulletin related to Microsoft Security Advisory 973882?**

Yes. [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882) describes vulnerabilities in public and private versions of the Active Template Library (ATL). As a defense-in-depth measure, this security update (MS09-034) mitigates known attack vectors within Internet Explorer for those components and controls that have been developed with the versions of ATL described in Microsoft Security Advisory (973882) and [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131).

**Where can I find more information about the Microsoft Active Template Library security vulnerabilities and associated updates?**

For more information regarding the Active Template Library (ATL) security vulnerabilities, see [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882).

To download the update for ATL, see Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131).

**If I have installed the MS09-035 update, do I still need to install this update?**

Yes. [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131) is specifically intended for developers using the Active Template Library (ATL) with Microsoft Visual Studio. Developers who redistribute components and controls built with ATL should install the update provided in MS09-035 to ensure that their components and controls do not contain the vulnerabilities described in that bulletin.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. As a defense-in-depth measure, this Internet Explorer security update helps mitigate known attack vectors within Internet Explorer for those components and controls that have been developed with vulnerable versions of ATL.

In addition to the changes that are listed in the **Vulnerability Information** section of this bulletin, this update includes two defense-in-depth changes. As such, this update includes a mitigation that helps prevent components and controls built using vulnerable versions of ATL from being exploited in Internet Explorer. The new defense-in-depth protections offered in MS09-034 include updates to Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 that monitor and help prevent the successful exploitation of all known public and private library ATL vulnerabilities, including the vulnerabilities that could lead to bypassing ActiveX's kill bit security feature. These protections are designed to help protect customers from Web-based attacks.

The first defense-in-depth measure is enabled by default and modifies how ATL-based ActiveX controls read persisted data. The first mitigation is a change to modify how ATL-based controls read persisted data by detecting specific call patterns that are problematic. One such example is the call pattern that led to the MSVidCtl.dll exploit addressed by [MS09-032](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=157386), one of the security updates released on July 14th.Â The mitigation addresses the ATL vulnerabilities described in [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882) and [MS09-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158131).Â The change is enabled by default for all affected platforms and will help block ATL vulnerabilities for controls loaded in Internet Explorer, including those not created by Microsoft.

The second defense-in-depth measure is related to the first, but provides stronger protections and increases application compatibility risk. This defense-in-depth measure is disabled by default and offers the ability to regulate usage of IPersistStream\* and IPersistStorage interface implementations within individual controls. Application developers and end-users can opt-in to enable this mitigation for any application using the [WebOC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa752040%28vs.85%29.aspx) using the new Feature Control Key, **FEATURE\_RESTRICT\_OBJECT\_DATA\_ATTRIBUTE**:

1. Open HKLM or HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl key in the registry.
2. Create a subkey for **FEATURE\_RESTRICT\_OBJECT\_DATA\_ATTRIBUTE**, if it doesn't already exist.
3. Add a new REG\_DWORD value for a process name, or \* to opt-in all processes, and set its value to 1.

As an example, the following registry value opts in to the Feature Control key, **FEATURE\_RESTRICT\_OBJECT\_DATA\_ATTRIBUTE** for all processes.

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (or HKEY_CURRENT_USER)SOFTWAREMicrosoftInternet ExplorerMainFeatureControlFEATURE_RESTRICT_OBJECT_DATA_ATTRIBUTE* = 0x00000001`

Individual controls can opt-out of the mitigation by using a new ActiveX Compatibility Flag DWORD value:

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftInternet ExplorerActiveX Compatibility{CLSID of ActiveX control}Compatibility Flags = 0x02000000`

The **FEATURE\_RESTRICT\_OBJECT\_DATA\_ATTRIBUTE** is currently off by default due to some applications known to load data into **IPersistStream\*** or **IPersistStorage** implementations, by design.

**Additional Defense in Depth Mitigations and Workaround Guidance for Potentially Vulnerable Controls and Components Built Using Vulnerable Versions of the Active Template Library**

By default, the majority of ActiveX controls are not included in the default allow-list for ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer 7 or Internet Explorer 8. Only customers who have explicitly approved vulnerable controls by using the ActiveX opt-in feature are at risk to attempts to exploit this vulnerability. However, if a customer has used such ActiveX controls in a previous version of Internet Explorer, and then later upgraded to Internet Explorer 7 or Internet Explorer 8, then these ActiveX controls are enabled to work in Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8, even if the customer has not explicitly approved the ActiveX controls using the ActiveX opt-in feature.

Internet Explorer 8 offers enhanced protections by enabling DEP/NX memory protections by default for users on Windows XP Service Pack 3, Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Vista Service Pack 2, and Windows 7. DEP/NX helps foil attacks by preventing code from running in memory that is marked non-executable. Combined with Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), DEP/NX reduces the ability of attackers to successfully exploit certain types of memory-related vulnerabilities.

Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Vista and later operating systems run in [Protected Mode](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/ie7-protected-mode.aspx) by default in the Internet security zone. Protected Mode significantly reduces the ability of an attacker to write, alter, or destroy data on the user's machine or to install malicious code. This is accomplished by using the integrity mechanisms of Windows Vista and later, which restrict access to processes, files, and registry keys with higher integrity levels.

For the development of ActiveX Controls, SiteLock prevents ActiveX Controls from being repurposed by malicious sites by automatically querying the host for the URL of the Web page that is hosting the ActiveX control, extracting the protocol scheme and fully qualified domain name from that URL, and comparing it to a list created by the developer at build time to check whether the hosting site should be trusted.

## Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1917

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles a memory object. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-1917](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1917).

#### Mitigating Factors for Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1917

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerÃ¢ÂÂs Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039).

#### Workarounds for Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1917

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.

#### FAQ for Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1917

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has been deleted, memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What does the update do?**

The update modifies the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1919

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has been deleted, it may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).

**What does the update do?**

The update modifies the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
