{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1917",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption error in how Internet Explorer handles a memory object, leading to a use-after-free condition. When Internet Explorer attempts to access a deleted object, memory corruption occurs that may allow arbitrary code execution.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption",
        "Use-after-free"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control over the affected system, enabling them to install software, view or modify data, or create new accounts.",
      "attack_vector": "The primary attack vector is via a specially crafted webpage hosted on a malicious website or on a compromised site that the user visits via a link in an email or instant message.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website with a specially crafted page that the user would need to be convinced to visit."
    },
    {
       "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1918",
       "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from improper handling of table operations within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it involves a memory corruption error when dealing with HTML objects and table manipulations.",
       "weaknesses": [
         "Memory corruption",
         "Improper handling of table operations"
       ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation results in remote code execution with the same user rights as the logged-on user. Attackers could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights on systems where users are logged in with administrative privileges.",
       "attack_vector": "The attack vector is a specially crafted webpage. An attacker would have to convince users to visit the malicious web page through a link in an email message, instant messenger, or via a compromised website.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website or compromise a legitimate website to serve a specially crafted HTML document, which would trigger the vulnerability when loaded in the targeted user's Internet Explorer browser."
    },
    {
       "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1919",
       "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error, when Internet Explorer accesses an object that has been deleted. This improper handling of objects in memory leads to memory corruption.",
       "weaknesses": [
         "Memory corruption",
         "Use-after-free"
       ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
       "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves a user visiting a website that serves a specially crafted webpage. The webpage leverages the vulnerability when the browser attempts to access a deleted object in memory, allowing arbitrary code execution. The attacker would need to convince a user to view such a website, commonly via an email or instant message link or through compromised websites.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage or compromise a legitimate website to serve the specially crafted page and rely on user interaction to execute the code."
