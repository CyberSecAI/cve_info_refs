Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-1661

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `utopic.php` file of microTopic v1, which is a simple news/opinion site CMS. Specifically, the script uses unsanitized user-supplied input in a SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection in the `rating` parameter passed via a POST request to `utopic.php`.
- The `$_POST[rating]` variable is directly embedded into a SQL query without proper sanitization:
   ```php
   $query="SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP(max(datum)) FROM {$my_table}_ip WHERE id='$_POST[rating]' AND ip='$_SERVER[REMOTE_ADDR]'";
   ```

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords. This is achieved by using conditional SQL statements within the injected `rating` parameter.
- **Potential Full Database Compromise:** Depending on the database user privileges, the attacker might be able to perform additional malicious operations such as modifying or deleting data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a POST request to the `utopic.php` file.
- **`rating` Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `rating`, which is expected to contain a numerical ID of a topic. However, it is used in a SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP POST requests to the target server.
- **Knowledge of the Application:**  The attacker must know that the `rating` parameter exists and it is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **No authentication required:** The exploit can be executed without prior authentication.
- **Magic Quotes OFF:** The exploit is effective when magic quotes are turned off in PHP.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided Perl exploit script demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability, by injecting SQL queries via the `rating` POST parameter.
- The exploit script utilizes a blind SQL injection technique, extracting data character by character.
- The script brute-forces the username and password hashes from the `utopic_login` table.
- The exploit targets `/admin/utopic.php` and leverages the `SendSQL` function in `mysql.php`.

In summary, microTopic v1 is vulnerable to blind SQL injection in the `rating` parameter of `utopic.php`. This allows an attacker to extract sensitive information by exploiting the lack of sanitization of user-provided input within SQL queries, which is demonstrated in the provided exploit script.
