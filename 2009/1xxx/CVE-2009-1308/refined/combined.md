1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.

- java-1\_4\_2-ibm/IBMJava2
This update brings IBM Java 1.4.2 to Service Release 13.
It fixes lots of bugs and following security issues:
CVE-2008-3104: Security vulnerabilities in the Java
Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet that is
loaded from a remote system to circumvent network access
restrictions and establish socket connections to certain
services running on the local host, as if it were loaded
from the system that the applet is running on. This may
allow the untrusted remote applet the ability to exploit
any security vulnerabilities existing in the services it
has connected to.
CVE-2008-3112: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create arbitrary files with the
permissions of the user running the untrusted Java Web
Start application.
CVE-2008-3113: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create or delete arbitrary files with
the permissions of the user running the untrusted Java
Web Start application.
CVE-2008-3114: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to
determine the location of the Java Web Start cache.
CVE-2008-5350: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or
application to list the contents of the home directory of
the user running the applet or application.
CVE-2008-5346: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an
untrusted applet or application to read arbitrary memory
locations in the process that the applet or application is
running in.
CVE-2008-5343: A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java
Plug-in may allow hidden code on a host to make network
connections to that host and to hijack HTTP sessions using
cookies stored in the browser.
CVE-2008-5344: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with applet classloading may allow an
untrusted applet to read arbitrary files on a system that
the applet runs on and make network connections to hosts
other than the host it was loaded from.
CVE-2008-5359: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow
an untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges.
For example, an untrusted applet may grant itself
permissions to read and write local files or execute local
applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5339: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java Web Start
application to make network connections to hosts other than
the host that the application is downloaded from.
CVE-2008-5340: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with launching Java Web Start applications may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted application may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted application.
CVE-2008-5348: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with authenticating users through
Kerberos may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) to the
system as a whole, due to excessive consumption of
operating system resources.
CVE-2008-2086: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow
certain trusted operations to be performed, such as
modifying system properties.
CVE-2008-5345: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows
code loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost.
This may allow code that is maliciously placed on the local
filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network
access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed if
the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be
leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains
that map a name to the localhost).
CVE-2008-5351: The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8)
decoder in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts
encodings that are longer than the "shortest" form. This
behavior is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may
be leveraged to exploit systems running software that
relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form
sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be
decoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that
are not otherwise accessible to be read, if the URIs are
not checked following UTF-8 decoding.
CVE-2008-5360: The Java Runtime Environment creates
temporary files with insufficiently random names. This may
be leveraged to write JAR files which may then be loaded as
untrusted applets and Java Web Start applications to access
and provide services from localhost and hence steal cookies.
CVE-2008-5353: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects
may allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5356: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5354: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java
application that is launched through the command line to
escalate privileges. For example, the untrusted Java
application may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are
accessible to the user running the untrusted Java
application.
This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or
Java Web Start application.
CVE-2008-5357: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5342: A security vulnerability in the the Java Web
Start BasicService allows untrusted applications that are
downloaded from another system to request local files to be
displayed by the browser of the user running the untrusted
application.

This update of openssl fixes the following problems:
- CVE-2009-0590: ASN1\_STRING\_print\_ex() function allows remote denial
of service
- CVE-2009-0591: CMS\_verify() function allows signatures to look valid
- CVE-2009-0789: denial of service due to malformed ASN.1 structures
Affected products: SLES 9, SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libsoup
Large strings could lead to a heap overflow in the base64 encoding and
decoding functions. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0585).
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, POS 9, OES, SLES 9, SLE 10
- opensc/libopensc2
Private data objects on smartcards initialized with OpenSC could be
accessed without authentication (CVE-2009-0368).
Only blank cards initialized with OpenSC are affected by this
problem. Affected cards need to be manually fixed, updating the
opensc package alone is not sufficient!
Please carefully read and follow the instructions on the following
web site if you are using PIN protected private data objects on
smart cards other than Oberthur, and you have initialized those
cards using OpenSC:
<http://en.opensuse.org/Smart_Cards/Advisories>
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- python-crypto
Missing checks for the key length in the ARC2 module potentially allowed
attackers to crash applications using python-crypto or potentially even
cause execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0544).
Affected products: SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- unbound
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow in the
ldns\_rr\_new\_frm\_str\_internal()
function. This allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
DNS resource record (RR) with a long class field and possibly TTL field.
(CVE-2009-1086)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could lead to crashes, make the viewer
run into an infinite loop or potentially even allow execution of
arbitrary code.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine of Thunderbird. If a

user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into viewing malicious web

content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-1303](/security/CVE-2009-1303), [CVE-2009-1305](/security/CVE-2009-1305), [CVE-2009-1392](/security/CVE-2009-1392), [CVE-2009-1833](/security/CVE-2009-1833),

[CVE-2009-1838](/security/CVE-2009-1838))

Several flaws were discovered in the way Thunderbird processed malformed

URI schemes. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website and

had JavaScript and plugins enabled, a remote attacker could execute

arbitrary JavaScript or steal private data. ([CVE-2009-1306](/security/CVE-2009-1306), [CVE-2009-1307](/security/CVE-2009-1307),

[CVE-2009-1309](/security/CVE-2009-1309))

Cefn Hoile discovered Thunderbird did not adequately protect against

embedded third-party stylesheets. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker

could exploit this to perform script injection attacks using XBL bindings.

([CVE-2009-1308](/security/CVE-2009-1308))

Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang, and Ming Zhang discovered that

Thunderbird did not properly handle error responses when connecting to a

proxy server. If a user had JavaScript enabled while using Thunderbird to

view websites and a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive

information. ([CVE-2009-1836](/security/CVE-2009-1836))

It was discovered that Thunderbird could be made to run scripts with

elevated privileges. If a user had JavaScript enabled while having

certain non-default add-ons installed and were tricked into viewing a

malicious website, an attacker could cause a chrome privileged object, such

as the browser sidebar, to run arbitrary code via interactions with the

attacker controlled website. ([CVE-2009-1841](/security/CVE-2009-1841))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-18

## XSS hazard using third-party stylesheets and XBL bindings

Announced
April 21, 2009
Reporter
Cefn Hoile
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.9

### Description

Web developer **Cefn Hoile** reported that sites which
allow users to embed third-party stylesheets are vulnerable to script
injection attacks using XBL bindings. While this behavior was
documented previously, it was determined that this particular risk was
not well-understood by some websites. To mitigate this risk Mozilla
added a restriction that requires XBL bindings to come from the same
origin as the bound document.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail.

You can see more examples using this possible zero day attack at...
<http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ebClientServerCallDynamicScriptObject>
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit ebay page if it's still up at <http://tinyurl.com/c7ow2l>
Actual Results:
The content being rewritten before your very eyes.
Reload and trying to hit stop before the XBL document loads means you can see the original page. If you let it fully load, you see the fraudulently modified page.
The content is rewritten unless you prevent that remote stylesheet chain being fully loaded.
Expected Results:
This should not be possible and I believe reveals an XSS vulnerability for firefox. Firefox should prevent XBL bindings from remote locations in the same way it prevents other active content.
Let me know if I'm missing some important aspect here and this shouldn't be considered a security issue for Firefox.
The use of XBL suggests that Firefox security is at fault here, but I'd like to understand more and file more relevant/useful/well-informed bugs in the future.

Which version of firefox were you using? These days we require that the XBL document is hosted on the same domain as the main document. So in order to attack a page on ebay.co.uk the XBL file needs to be hosted there too.
Or are you saying that you are able to host the XBL file on a different domain somehow?

Sorry for no version info. It looked like this was visible in the auto-generated bug report on submission but I was mistaken. I'm running Firefox 3.06.
Happens to be Ubuntu linux, but I suspect that's not relevant actually, and it is likely to be reproducible on other platforms.

As for 'able to host the XBL file on a different domain somehow' - just look at the bug report. My understanding of this situation is that it's a major violation of the Firefox security model, in that a <LINK ... rel=stylesheet> element has been able to inject an XBL binding hosted at officelive.com and therefore execute arbitrary code in the page - code which didn't originate at ebay.co.uk.
No doubt Ebay's filters should prevent this, and indeed I don't see the value of the Myspace-like open authoring of content as part of a powerfully authenticated domain with links to Paypal. However, Firefox's security model is also broken and this is the proof.
Also note this is a zero day attack which I experienced 'in the wild' whilst actually using eBay. It's not theoretical.

The other thing you can do to prove this (unless it's just me for some weird reason, is just visit the page which I've tinyurled).
It's still running the malicious code, which it may not be for long.
You will see the original details on an auction with 5 days 11 hours to run, and then they are swiftly updated to introduce fraudulent details, including a different third party who is supposedly hosting the auction, a different date, a different current bid.
The id of the auction is changed so that an ordinary user can't report the listing as fraudulent, since the id shows up wrong. This is pretty serious, especially if they're able to use a frameset to monitor you entering your paypal credentials or something.
What exactly they're trying to do with this proof-of-concept attack is a mystery to me but it's real, and I was nearly duped into communicating with the imaginary seller, but it looked fishy to me so I investigated further.

Note also that this exploit is in use elsewhere, though god knows which auctions these XBLs are injected into...

<http://www.vegadhesif.com/photos/jdr/index.html>
<http://ukphone.web44.net/addxz.xml>
...if anyone knows a way to search for <LINK ...> inclusions then I can try to report affected auctions to eBay, but I don't think it's possible to search within elements like this with mainstream search engines.
Is it better not to report any further to ebay until a patch is certain?

The same-origin policy is applied to the entity loading the XBL. If you're loading it from a stylesheet at officelive.com, then you can only load XBL from officelive.com.
In this case, the page being attacked allowed an off-site stylesheet, which is what allowed the off-site XBL to load. But once you allow an off-site stylesheet, you don't even need XBL to rewrite the page at least as far as what the user sees is concerned. Just CSS generated content and display:none is pretty much enough to make it say anything you want.
So the real bug here is in the site allowing off-site stylesheets, really. That's not safe, and never has been in any browser.

So now I'm really confused.
What you're saying is that there's a same origin policy which is designed to mitigate the possibility of javascript being loaded maliciously using a cross-site scripting attack by limiting the domains from which javascript can be loaded.
However, at the same time you're saying that it's OK for this same malicious operation to be possible using a Mozilla-specific extension which reopens the same hole that the same origin policy was crafted to prevent!
Attacker: "Instead of loading javascript which is blocked by both Firefox and IE, why not load a stylesheet and take advantage of the powerful mozilla extensions which are available to go ahead and load code into the page as per the original attack."
Also if it's so easy to inject code using a CSS stylesheet, why are the attackers using a Mozilla extension to inject the code? Perhaps because the CSS content property has been specifically designed to limit the scope of what you can control in the page?
<http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#content>
Maybe I've missed something, but there's also a difference between manipulating the content of a page, (e.g. hiding, showing and changing text - the domain of a stylesheet), and executing arbitrary client-side code in the page, which allows phishing for passwords, redirection of form submissions etc.
I don't believe you're right that these two scenarios have the same severity for the above reasons.

There's a same-origin policy designed to mitigate cross-site reading of data by preventing CSS under the control of site A to link to XBL from site B, since that would allow reading data in XML files in some (rather rare) circumstances. This same-origin policy is working fine.
There is no same-origin policy on linking to scripts, in general (you can link cross-site with <script>). There is similarly no same-origin policy on linking to stylesheets. Both are dangerous operations; a site that cares about security can't allow either one. eBay seems to be allowing at least linking to stylesheets.
I didn't say anything about injecting code via a CSS stylesheet. I said something about rewriting the page. I suggest giving CSS3 Generated Content (parts of which are implemented by some browsers) a careful look. I also suggest reading the CSS2.1 generated content section, which is already vastly more powerful than the CSS2 section you linked to (eg. allows positioning, floating, creating tables, etc using generated content). If a site is relying on the CSS2 limitations in generated content, it's already lost.
You're correct that the use of XBL to inject code here makes life a little bit easier for the attacker, in that they can rewrite the DOM, not just what the user sees... But I think the relevant features of this attack could in fact be carried out in a browser that implements CSS3 Generated Content with a bit more effort, and most likely in one that implements just CSS2.1 Generated Content with another bit more effort. At least in terms of totally changing what the user sees. You wouldn't be able to change behavior of links and such; it's not clear to me whether that's relevant to the attack.
In other words, the site most certainly has a security hole, which should be reported to said site.
That doesn't mean we shouldn't do anything to mitigate on our end, of course. The reason the security policy is what it is right now (based on the link origin rather than the document being targeted) is the following:
1) It's required for making user style sheets (located at file://) linking to
user XBL (located at file://) work with web pages (located at http://).
We \_might\_ be able to work around this by skipping the same-origin load
check for user stylesheets.
2) It's desirable for making UA style sheets linking to chrome XBL work with
web pages (e.g. for marquee or video controls to work). Similar to above.
3) Conceptually, for the data-stealing aspect of things, the relevant thing is
who controls the thing being linked to and the source of the link (the
stylesheet).
4) This allows third-party stylesheets to provide the third party's XBL and
have it actually apply to the page. There are in fact sites that rely on
this behavior; I can dig up the relevant bugs if really desired.
5) Since the stylesheet can already totally mess with the way the page looks
and behaves, the assumption was that any site trying to be secure would not
allow links to stylesheets it doesn't trust. Especially because Microsoft
behaviors, Microsoft's script extensions to CSS, and XBL are all fairly
well-known technologies that allow script to be added via CSS and have for
\_years\_ now.
One mitigation option might be to disallow script in XBL bindings that are being applied via author sheet and are not same-origin with the bound document. But we have to be pretty careful with item 4. I \_think\_ the relevant bindings didn't have script in the one high-profile case we saw before we fixed things, but that doesn't mean they don't in other cases...
No matter what, eBay needs to fix their filters. Their end of this is just broken.

Huh?! That was not the intention as I recall it. I thought we applied the same-origin policy such that the XBL file had to be same-origin as the bound \*document\*, no matter where the CSS was hosted. Specifically to prevent the type of attack described here.
Looking at the code it doesn't look like the case though. That is indeed bad.

No question about ebay. Why rely on your user's browser security model to limit risk when you can handle it server side and totally nail down the exploit. I completely agree.
They may be relying on the fact that the journey which incorporates paypal details navigates away from the page with the user-generated content, but I'm pretty sure it's possible to fake this with smart XMLHTTP loading, so that it never leaves the page which is under the control of the attacker, even though it appears to in its content refresh behaviour.
Glad to know that a response may be considered and I understand a little more now about the richer CSS models which you're comparing this with.
I'm still a little concerned that this might be considered valid behaviour given the historical need for quite well-nuanced same-origin policies to close equivalent holes (in my view the same attack basically, except worryingly this is unique to the Mozilla platform's additional features).
Also I agree the scope of this specific attack (changing content) may be within reach of more advanced CSS standards, but client-side javascript (especially stuff like keyboard eventing) is a whole lot more worrying from a security standpoint.
I just don't think they've fully explored what's possible given this loophole, yet. It would be good to think it's closed before someone does, and it becomes a mozilla-only-hole headline given the XBL dependency, unlike many other javascript loopholes which are consistently experienced across browsers.
I can see you're on the case and should leave it up to you guys to take it from here as it's outside my experience already.

Jonas, see [bug 204140](/show_bug.cgi?id=204140 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Allow user style sheets to load XBL from file: URLs"). Before that, we were indeed using aBoundDocument->NodePrincipal() for the load check.
The bug that involved cross-site XBL linkage which would regress if we undid that change is [bug 470049](/show_bug.cgi?id=470049 "RESOLVED FIXED - wellsfargo.com - password field does not display in 1.8.1.x browsers") and [bug 387971](/show_bug.cgi?id=387971 "VERIFIED WORKSFORME - Password field on http://www.wellsfargo.com does not render"). wellsfargo.com links to an akamai stylesheet that loads akamai XBL. The XBL there doesn't include script, as I said. We fixed this on the 1.8 branch in [bug 470461](/show_bug.cgi?id=470461 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FIX]Create frames for XBL that's security-blocked (1.8 branch only)."), sort of, by just not hiding the content if the XBL is blocked.
So I think we have three primary options:
1) Leave this as-is.
2) Change things so that for author sheets only we use the bound document
principal for the security check, and land [bug 470461](/show_bug.cgi?id=470461 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FIX]Create frames for XBL that's security-blocked (1.8 branch only).")'s fix on trunk and
1.9.1.
3) Change things so that for author sheets only we disallow script in XBL if
the bound document is not same-origin with the XBL.
Relative drawbacks: For option 1, as described in [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=481558#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - Loading an untrusted stylesheet should not allow that stylesheet to inject script using XBL"). For option 2, breaks cases where bindings are used via an off-site stylesheet (say the Akamai case above) and the site relies on the binding somehow (which Wells Fargo does not, fwiw). For option 3, breaks cases where a site relies on script in a binding. Principle of least surprise is probably on the side of part 2, since loading the binding and applying its content but not scripts is a bit weird. On the other hand, part 3 allows the presentation parts of XBL to continue working and just disables the unsafe part....
Long-term, the right fix, of course, is to run the XBL JS with the principal of the XBL document, but that's XBL2-land. :(
sicking, thoughts?

Oh, and the point is that approach 2 and approach 3 are equally difficult in the sense of both needing us to detect XBL loads from author sheets specially...

Note the "expression()" bit in the stylesheet: current versions of IE show the same behavior. (IE8 removes Microsoft's version of this functionality -- good for them! Now to kill content-XBL on our end....)

I had a contact from theregister about this bug, and below is the relevant extract of our email exchange relating to the bug.
My understanding is that I shouldn't report any technical details of the bug in the public domain at present.
However, if you feel it's not got any major significance then I can fill him in a little more.
The form below this comments box shows a status of 'Fixed' which seems a little unusual given the discussion. Is this considered fixed? If so I guess I can be more gabby with him.

Hi, Dan.
Status is that it's a New, Core Security bug.
I can't really offer you much more at this stage. That's one of the reasons for the controlled distribution of bugs with this potential significance. If I get confirmation from one of the mozilla teams that I can discuss freely in the public domain then I'm happy to share the whole tamale with you.

This bug is not marked as 'Fixed'. Maybe [bug 453070](/show_bug.cgi?id=453070 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - noscript: nonsensical status/resolution combination shown for open bugs") confused you?
I made this bug public on Thursday. I'm not sure why The Register would think you have more information than is visible here.

Yes, definitely do not spread details about this bug until we have a patch released to our users and have given users a chance to upgrade. Otherwise we are just risking further attacks against users.
I'm starting to work on a patch right now, should have something in a few hours.Assignee: nobody → jonas

Among the people who do XSS attacks remote stylesheets and in-line style are well-known attack vectors. For example the four or five vectors following
<http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html#XSS_Remote_style_sheet> plus a few scattered others (search for "expression"). Note that in several vectors the point is not that expression() runs code--that's assumed--but rather how to sneak an expression into a document that's trying to defend against it. That is, both the attackers and defenders know about this and the attackers have to sneak by the defender's filters.

"Possible patch" still gives random file:// sheets extra privileges; that came up when we were discussing that approach, no?
For what it's worth, giving UA/user sheets the system principal, as also discussed is pretty easy; I'll post a patch later today.

It doesn't give them more privileges than they already have. You'd have to get the user to save a site, while somehow getting the site to link to a stylesheet that you control somewhere else on the hard drive. Not even sure how you'd do that given that we update stylesheet link in the process of saving files right?
And even then the saved page doesn't run in-domain with the original site which means that it's very hard to cause much harm that the XBL is linked in.

Sure, if we're comfortable doing that quickly, and doing that on all branches, that is even better.

I just realized (before reading [comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=481558#c23 "RESOLVED FIXED - Loading an untrusted stylesheet should not allow that stylesheet to inject script using XBL")), that what that patch really enforces is "if the bound document couldn't load the stylesheet that linked to the binding, then allow that sheet to apply the binding", with the obvious assumption that if the document didn't load it and it's applying to the document, then someone else who has the requisite permissions applied the sheat. That's a pretty nice idea, actually.

Yeah, sorry, forgot the details of last nights patch. But that was exactly the idea. The only downside is that if a user adds a binding in a UA stylesheet and saves a file the UA binding won't be attached. That will get automatically fixed if we swich all UA stylesheets to chrome principals.

Attached file
[The real original content, as copied from view source with the original page still in memory.](attachment.cgi?id=366226)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=366226&action=edit)

Shows how far I am from being a Firefox hacker!
I didn't realise that Firefox actually doesn't save content based on a transformation of its HTTP stream, but based on the live document object model in some way, at least in this case.
Consequently the HTML source of zipped files included above ALREADY INCLUDE the changes executed by the malicious code, and are not a record of the unmodified page.
I was able to recover the original source, fortunately, since one of my test machines still had it loaded in memory. I'll also submit some small screenshots showing the impact of the exploit, examples of which I have shared with the Register.
I suppose from the Mozilla point of view, the main issue is that the document is being rewritten at all. However, there may be others looking into the social engineering or other aspects of this attack, and really want to know what the attackers were trying to do. This permits them to compare and contrast the before and after pages.
If anyone really cares that much, they should be able to merge in the original document's content with Kompare or similar and see the exploit running.
Is this saving of actively modified content an intended behaviour, or itself somehow a consequence of the XBL binding?
It's taken an age to recover the original source. Next time I'll use wget for a superior browsing experience :)

It's your choice when saving: when you save you choose whether to save as "HTML only" (just the original HTML), or "Web page, complete" (serialized DOM with all resources it's linking to at that point in time).

So... technically, if we're trying to protect aBoundDocument the CheckMayLoad should somehow be the other way. This is the check for protecting the binding's data from the document... This really only make a difference for file:// URIs, though, and I agree that it makes sense to allow a file:// document use whatever XBL it can load.
It's worth having a same-origin equivalent test checking that the XBL \_is\_ attached in that case.
As far as user/UA sheets, let's just handle that in [bug 416942](/show_bug.cgi?id=416942 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Give agent (and maybe user?) sheets the system principal"), I guess. We can then evaluate which we feel is safer for branches.

I, like many others (including :sicking it seems) believed that the statement from <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XBL/XBL_1.0_Reference/Elements#binding>
"The normal same-origin policy is used for web sites; they can only link to XBL files on the same domain, or within the chrome." meant that a page from good.com couldn't load a XBL binding from evil.com, no matter if imported by a stylesheet from the same evil.com (a stylesheet is not a web site, IMHO).
If I was not committed to supporting Firefox 2, I would have probably already dropped NoScript's own cross-site XBL protection (introduced in NoScript 1.1.8.5, months before Firefox 3's), which actually blocks \*any\* cross-site XBL (i.e. XBL from a domain different than the loading \*document\*) except from chrome: the way the statement above seemed to imply and the only effective way from a XSS mitigation standpoint. Blessed be FSM the Merciful for inspiring backward compatibility concerns in my soul ;)

That documentation just doesn't match what was implemented... This is sadly common-seeming in our devmo security documentation recently. :(
> (a stylesheet is not a web site, IMHO)
Well... it's an independent entity with an independent security context. A site can load a stylesheet but not be able to read it. A site can load a stylesheet which is not allowed to link to things the site can link to, or \_is\_ allowed to link to things the site cannot link to....
If you think a stylesheet somehow magically gets the security context of whatever site loads it, you're wrong. Doing that would actually introduce various privacy and security bugs.

And just to make it clear, we're changing behavior so that we'll check \_both\_ the stylesheet and the bound document against the XBL. But importing untrusted CSS is still a security hole one can drive a truck through for a site.

Yeah, I was thinking about this when writing the patch. However for file: it does make sense to me that you can only load XBL that is in a sub directory of the bound document.

Actually, the more I think about it, the more it makes sense to use CheckSameOriginURI. I think I want to use aBoundDocument->NodePrincipal()->GetURI though, right?

> Not sure what you mean here?
The patch includes a mochitest that verifies that if localhost:8888 links to a stylesheet at example.com and that stylesheet then tries to load XBL from example.com then the XBL is not applied.
It would be good to have a test that verifies that if localhost:8888 links to a stylesheet at localhost:8888 which loads XBL from localhost:8888 then the XBL \_is\_ applied. Or do we have such a test already?

No I don't, nor I implied that anywhere, as far as I can see.
I only said that the XBL policy change in Firefox 3, introduced as a XSS
mitigation, was ineffective since we didn't actually check same-domain with the
\*document\* as well, and that the documentation gave a false sense of security.

That's the right way to do it, and how Firefox+NoScript has been already
behaving for a long time :)

No, you could still link to XBL in the same directory. I do agree that it makes it considerably harder to use XBL in file://, but honestly I'm not terribly concerned about that.
I would be fine with keeping the patch as is though given the current implementations of CheckMayLoad. If those change we can always revisit this code.
I'll add tests that check that XBL is applied as appropriate.

No, you couldn't. For file:// URIs, CheckSameOriginURI is equivalent to an nsIFile::Equals() check. If we had working file:// mochitests I'd be asking you to add a test right now... ;)

I am, if we're taking the change on stable branches.

Correction. It does, but only if a disabled-by-default preference is enabled.

Define "kludge". What we did was to force that the XBL file is hosted on the same origin as the page.

"kludge" is something very close to a "wallpaper patch".
i don't mean to flame the author of the patch.
mean to point out that XBL caused worse problems in the past than something that barely qualifies as a real XSS imo.

Then no, the patch is not a kludge.

It is real XSS, and this behavior conflicts with a documented XSS mitigation introduced in Firefox 3: see my [comment #31](/show_bug.cgi?id=481558#c31 "RESOLVED FIXED - Loading an untrusted stylesheet should not allow that stylesheet to inject script using XBL") and <http://hackademix.net/2009/03/09/cross-site-xbl-returns-from-the-dead/>
Therefore it's far from "well documented behavior", and a legitimate bug (either failed mitigation or bad documentation). Fixing it was the right thing to do, even though importing unfiltered and untrusted 3rd party stylesheets remains a very stupid thing to do for many other reasons.

I strongly believe that this patch attempts to fix something that is not broken, and also breaks functionality in existing sites. Firefox shouldn't be crippled to accommodate one site's mistake in their server-side filtering. I'm wary of the precedent being set.
Suppose one runs a site with multiple subdomains based on user accounts - ADAM.mysite.com, BILLY.mysite.com, etc. Suppose also that, for security reasons, there are global css/xbl bindings linked to from each subdomain's HTML pages that can only be hosted on the WWW.mysite.com subdomain. This is now impossible as of Shiretoko 3.5b4pre. I'll have to manifest a workaround if this patch is not reversed, and I'm sure I'm not alone.
There has not been enough discussion about the obstinate frivolousness of this patch. It will cause problems for many unsuspecting content authors who are accustomed to the current ruleset for successful xbl bindings. I truly believe that the catalyst for this patch was eBay's laziness in server-side coding and not a legitimate security problem in Firefox.
Filtering css link tags from untrusted dynamic user content is entirely eBay's responsibility and such filtering is meant to be implemented server-side, NOT piecemeal at the browser level.

James, if you're relying on Mozilla's current XBL implementation as part of a website, you'll have even bigger issues in the not to far off future when it goes away altogether and is replaced with W3C XBL (which other than the name and the basic idea is pretty much completely different)...
Legitimate open web usage of XBL is very rare as far as we can tell; intranets or sites that require a login might be a different story, of course.

Updated eBay scammers have been exploiting unpatched weaknesses in the Firefox and Internet Explorer browsers to deliver counterfeit pages that try to dupe people surfing the online auction house to bid on fraudulent listings.

The attacks managed to inject eBay pages with hostile code by exploiting issues long known to afflict Firefox and IE. While eBay has managed to block the exploit from working on its domains, other websites that accept user-generated content may still be vulnerable to the attacks, web security experts warn.

Firefox security volunteers say they are in the process of patching the vulnerability. For their part, Microsoft officials say the exploits aren't the result of a vulnerability in IE but rather of websites that fail to properly protect against such attacks.

The evil genius behind the eBay scheme managed to pull off what amounts to an XSS, or cross-site scripting, attack that injected forbidden javascript elements stored on third-party websites. That allowed the eBay pages to contain outside email links and other unauthorized code while still evading toolbars designed to detect fraudulent listings.

In addition to injecting a link that automatically prompts users to email the seller at an aol.com address, the scam used a random number generator to change the item number each time the page was loaded. Item numbers are supposed to be unique and are used to report fraudulent listings. Changing the number made it harder for eBay's fraud busters to remove bogus auctions.

The attacks targeted Firefox by exploiting the way the browser implements what's known as XBL, or XML binding language. By invoking a rogue CSS, or cascade style sheet, hosted on a third-party site, the Mozilla browser was tricked into running forbidden code that injected fraudulent content into the listings. Over the past week, there has been [considerable debate among Mozilla security volunteers](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=481558) about whether the condition amounted to a security vulnerability or an intended feature. They decided to make changes to the browser after witnessing the eBay scams that abused it.

"Patches are being constructed to get rid of an existing useful feature due to the patent inability of some websites to take elementary protective measures even after 5 years of the feature existing and after being repeatedly told to NOT link to external sheets by all browser vendors," one debate participant wrote *El Reg* in an email. "Note that the patch won't really help eBay much unless they really do start filtering the CSS they allow, since so much can be accomplished with just CSS."

A similar issue also related to off-site CSSes allowed the eBay attacks to work flawlessly on IE browsers, as the above screenshot makes clear. The exploit targeted IE functionality commonly referred to as expressions that has long been a known vector of XSS exploits. While IE 8 has been locked down to prevent such attacks, versions 6 and 7 of the Microsoft browser have not, and Bill Sisk, Microsoft's security response communications manager, said there are no plans to add such protections to the older browsers.

"Our investigation has shown that it is not a vulnerability in Internet Explorer," Sisk wrote in an email over the weekend. "In fact, the claim represents a method by which malicious attackers can exploit specific functionality in websites to bypass security measures. The nature of these attacks is not new and website operators commonly have protections in place to mitigate against such attacks."

Sisk's point is well-taken that eBay and other websites have an affirmative duty to filter code that allows these attacks to succeed. But his insistence that IE is blameless isn't entirely right, either. Microsoft has rightfully decided to protect IE 8 users by changing some of the browser's behavior concerning external CSS. Users of IE 7 deserve no less.

As was the case last week even large, sensitive sites such as eBay don't always protect against such attacks. Company spokeswoman Nichola Sharpe issued a statement that read in part: "This is not a new security threat, our online security experts are already aware of this and have identified it as a known bug in Firefox. eBay utilizes sophisticated security technologies to protect our customers against attacks such as this. We continually update our security to deal with emerging threats - and have done so with this threat."

Maybe, but eBay took more than 24 hours to remove one such fraudulent listing after it was reported, said Cefn Hoile, a browser security expert who first reported the Firefox issue.

"eBay has to take some responsibility for sure," Hoile wrote in an email. "They chose to serve this content which incorporated the third party stylesheet."

The only way to effectively protect users from such attacks is to white-list filter a set number of CSS functions deemed to be safe and to block everything else. That may be patently obvious to some, but if eBay has only now gotten around to implementing such measures, it's a good bet plenty of other websites are still wide open to this attack. Which means we wouldn't be surprised to see more attacks like these coming to a Web 2.0 site near you. ®

    which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-1306

    Daniel Veditz discovered that the Content-Disposition: header is ignored
    within the jar: URI scheme.

CVE-2009-1307

    Gregory Fleischer discovered that the same-origin policy for Flash files
    is inproperly enforced for files loaded through the view-source scheme,
    which may result in bypass of cross-domain policy restrictions.

CVE-2009-1308

    Cefn Hoile discovered that sites, which allow the embedding of third-party
    stylesheets are vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks through XBL
    bindings.

CVE-2009-1309

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered bypasses of the same-origin policy in the
    XMLHttpRequest Javascript API and the XPCNativeWrapper.

CVE-2009-1311

    Paolo Amadini discovered that incorrect handling of POST data when
    saving a web site with an embedded frame may lead to information disclosure.

CVE-2009-1312

    It was discovered that Iceweasel allows Refresh: headers to redirect
    to Javascript URIs, resulting in cross-site scripting.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.9.0.9-0lenny2.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
