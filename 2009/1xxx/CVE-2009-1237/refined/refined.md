Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which is related to CVE-2009-1237:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an improper handling of system calls `SYS___mac_getfsstat` and `SYS_profil`/`SYS_add_profil` in the Apple macOS X kernel (xnu). The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation on the size parameters passed to these syscalls. Specifically, the code is able to specify an arbitrarily large size for memory allocation, which then leads to kernel memory exhaustion when the system attempts to handle the request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Lack of Size Validation:** The kernel does not properly validate the `bufsize` and `macsize` arguments in the `SYS___mac_getfsstat` system call, allowing a user to specify excessively large values.
2.  **Unbounded Memory Allocation:** Similarly, in the `SYS_profil` and `SYS_add_profil` calls, the kernel allocates memory based on parameters passed by the user, which also allows a large amount of memory to be requested, leading to potential memory exhaustion.
3.  **Local Privilege:** The vulnerability is exploitable from a local user context without requiring special privileges to initiate the vulnerable system calls, as these system calls are designed for legitimate use.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Kernel Memory Leak:** The `SYS___mac_getfsstat` system call can be exploited to leak kernel memory because the user can specify an arbitrary memory address for where the return data from this call should be copied. This means the system will try to copy the data to the arbitrary memory address that is provided (0xDEADBEEF in the provided proof-of-concept), which will lead to a memory leak, as well as kernel instability.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By requesting large amounts of memory through these syscalls, an attacker can exhaust available kernel memory, leading to a denial of service. The system may become unresponsive or crash due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local; an attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the vulnerable system.
*   **System Calls:** The attack is triggered by making specific system calls with crafted size and address arguments (`SYS___mac_getfsstat`, `SYS_profil`, `SYS_add_profil`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the target system to execute the exploit code. No root or special privileges are required initially.
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to compile and execute arbitrary code on the system to make the vulnerable syscalls.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided code examples serve as Proof of Concept (PoC) exploits to demonstrate the vulnerability. The `xnu-macfsstat-leak.c` code demonstrates the memory leak using `SYS___mac_getfsstat`, whereas the `xnu-profil-leak.c` demonstrates the memory exhaustion using `SYS_profil` and `SYS_add_profil` to trigger a DoS.
*   The vulnerability affects macOS X versions with xnu kernel versions up to and including 1228.3.13.
*   The exploits do not involve remote code execution, but rather local exploitation through the system call interface.
*   The `informationweek.com` content is unrelated to this CVE. The `secunia.com` content is general information on their research team and not specific to this CVE.

The provided information is consistent with the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-1237, but gives a much more detailed understanding of the underlying cause and the attack vectors.
