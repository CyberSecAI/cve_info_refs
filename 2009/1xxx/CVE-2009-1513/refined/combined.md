# USN-771-1: libmodplug vulnerabilities

7 May 2009

libmodplug vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [libmodplug](/security/cves?package=libmodplug) -

## Details

It was discovered that libmodplug did not correctly handle certain

parameters when parsing MED media files. If a user or automated system were

tricked into opening a crafted MED file, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2009-1438](/security/CVE-2009-1438))

Manfred Tremmel and Stanislav Brabec discovered that libmodplug did not

correctly handle long instrument names when parsing PAT sample files. If a

user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted PAT file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-1513](/security/CVE-2009-1513))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi,

The following SA (Secunia Advisory) id was published for
libmodplug:

SA34927[1]

> DESCRIPTION:
> A vulnerability has been reported in libmodplug, which can be
> exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and
> potentially compromise an application using the library.
>
> A boundary error exists within the "PATinst()" function in
> src/load_pat.c. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow by
> e.g. tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted file in an
> application using the library.
>
> SOLUTION:
> Update to version 0.8.7.
>
> PROVIDED AND/OR DISCOVERED BY:
> Manfred Tremmel and Stanislav Brabec
>
> ORIGINAL ADVISORY:
> <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2777467&group_id=1275&atid=301275>

You can find the trivial patch[2] in the upstream cvs repository.

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the CVE id

My plan was to fix this by packaging the new upstream version this
weekend that fixes this officially, but if you don't want to wait,
that's fine.

Yes, this is fine in unstable. For stable and oldstable we need to backport fixes.

Thanks for this.  However, I now have a new problem.  It doesn't
build.

I fixed this for 0.8.1-1lenny1 by performing the same autotools
reordering that I did for the build failure fix in 0.8.4-5.  I'm
attaching the .diff.gz and .dsc for that, since it's ready to go.

For the etch version, however, I'm a little leery of doing the same,
as I don't have an etch machine to test the build against.  If someone
has an etch box they can test the oldstable security fix against,
please do so and NMU.

Regards,

Reviewing this, I just noticed I attached the wrong .dsc.  The correct

processing a MED file with a crafted song comment or song name.

CVE-2009-1513

It was discovered that libmodplug is prone to a buffer overflow in the
PATinst function, when processing a long instrument name.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:0.8.4-1+lenny1.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:0.7-5.2+etch1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:0.8.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libmodplug packages.

### Background

ModPlug is a library for playing MOD-like music.

### Description

Two vulnerabilities have been reported in ModPlug:

* dummy reported an integer overflow in the CSoundFile::ReadMed()
  function when processing a MED file with a crafted song comment or song
  name, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-1438).
* Manfred Tremmel and Stanislav Brabec reported a buffer overflow in the
  PATinst() function when processing a long instrument name
  (CVE-2009-1513).

The GStreamer Bad plug-ins (gst-plugins-bad) before 0.10.11 built a
vulnerable copy of ModPlug.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to read specially crafted files,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ModPlug users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libmodplug-0.8.7"
```

gst-plugins-bad 0.10.11 and later versions do not include the ModPlug
plug-in (it has been moved to media-plugins/gst-plugins-modplug). All
gst-plugins-bad users should upgrade to the latest version and install
media-plugins/gst-plugins-modplug:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/gst-plugins-bad-0.10.11"
 # emerge --ask --verbose "media-plugins/gst-plugins-modplug"
```
