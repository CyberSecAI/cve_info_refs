| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=581604#c0)  Yves-Alexis Perez    2009-05-06 15:18:51 UTC  ``` Please describe the problem: Hi,  it seems that the default permissions on the local mail folders are set to 755, which means that, by default, other users on the systems might be able to read one's mail.  At least imap mail folder is 700, but local, config, vfolder and views are 755, so it'd be nice to have a consistent scheme. Same would apply to .evolution and .evolution/{mail,addressbook,calendar,â¦}  Steps to reproduce: 1.  2.  3.    Actual results:   Expected results:   Does this happen every time?   Other information: ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=581604#c1)  Gilles Dartiguelongue    2009-05-29 11:36:14 UTC  ``` Adding links for reference.  CVE links:  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1631>  <http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2009-1631>  Debian: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=526409>   RedHat: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=498648> Gentoo: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=270334> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=581604#c2)  Matthew Barnes    2009-05-29 12:05:06 UTC  ``` As I stated in the Red Hat bug, I don't think this warrants a CVE.  It's only an issue if you open up your home directory to other users, and in doing so you've already lost any security or privacy guarantees.  In any case, the best we can do for existing installs is reset the ~/.evolution permissions to 700. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=581604#c3)  Yves-Alexis Perez    2009-10-29 07:33:04 UTC  ``` That and for the various subfolders, I guess it's not really costly. What's the status on this one? on 2.28 it seems the existing permissions aren't reset (not sure about the new ones) ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=581604#c4)  Chenthill P    2010-01-21 12:04:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 151934](attachment.cgi?id=151934 "evo part of the patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=151934&action=edit "evo part of the patch") [[review]](review?bug=581604&attachment=151934) evo part of the patch  If the permissions for ~/.evolution is open, it changes the permissions for all internal folders else skip. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=581604#c5)  Chenthill P    2010-01-21 12:04:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 151935](attachment.cgi?id=151935 "eds part of the changes") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=151935&action=edit "eds part of the changes") [[review]](review?bug=581604&attachment=151935) eds part of the changes ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=581604#c6)  Matthew Barnes    2010-01-21 17:49:21 UTC  ``` Thanks for taking care of this, Chen!  Both patches look good. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=581604#c7)  Chenthill P    2010-01-29 20:23:34 UTC  ``` thanks matt :) pushed to master. will push it to stable branch as well. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=581604#c8)  Yves-Alexis Perez    2010-02-01 17:44:40 UTC  ``` Does this means it'll be in 2.30? ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=581604#c9)  Chenthill P    2010-02-05 06:45:16 UTC  ``` YVes, yes. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=581604#c10)  Bharath Acharya    2010-03-25 10:01:08 UTC  ``` Fixed as per [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=581604#c7) No use pushing it to 2.28.x Works good on 2.30.x Closing ``` |  |

Subject: CVE Request (evolution)

Hello everyone,

So there is a public bug about how Evolution sets permissions on folders in
~/.evolution

The current public bugs I know of are here:
<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=526409>
<http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=581604>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=498648>

This one probably needs some discussion with upstream before it gets fixed.
The threat is fairly minor, and we don't want to do anything rash and end up
breaking something.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=498648#c0)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-01 16:30:23 UTC  ``` A Debian bug report [1] brought to light the fact that Evolution does not create its data files with appropriate permissions.  Because of this, if user A on a system uses Evolut ion for email, user B can read any of user A's email. The default permissions for ~/.evolution is 0755, and the default permissions for Evolution data files is 0644 (although s trangely enough the default permissions for .index* files is 0600).  As well, by default in Fedora and RHEL5, a user's home directory has mode 0755 permissions.   By contrast, Firefox creates ~/.mozilla/firefox as mode 0700, protecting user bookmarks and caches.  Evolution should probably create/enforce ~/.evolution being mode 0700.  [1] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=526409>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=498648#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-05-14 17:42:46 UTC  ``` CVE-2009-1631:  The Mailer component in Evolution 2.26.1 and earlier uses world-readable permissions for the .evolution directory, and certain directories and files under .evolution/ related to local mail, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading these files.   Upstream report: <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=581604>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=498648#c2)  Matthew Barnes    2009-05-18 14:56:01 UTC  ``` I'm not really convinced this is a security issue.  Once you open up your home directory to other users the game's over.  They can just as easily read personal financial spreadsheets or other sensitive data as they can my mail.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=498648#c3)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-19 16:55:00 UTC  ``` Note that the defaults in RHEL5 and Fedora are to create home directories mode 0755, so this is an issue by default.  This isn't a user opening up their home directory; we create them opened up.  This probably wouldn't be an issue if home directories were mode 0700 by default and then the user had to relax permissions manually, but since we do this for them, I would consider it a security issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=498648#c4)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-26 17:59:53 UTC  ``` Hmmm... I'm looking into this further and I may be mistaken, but I can't account for why some of my home directories are mode 0755 on various systems.  Taking a look at using useradd on RHEL3, 4, and 5 shows new users have home directories mode 0700 by default, and likewise on Fedora 11.  On a Fedora 10 install where the home directory was mode 0755, using useradd and also system-config-user to create a new user creates them with mode 0700 permissions.  So I agree with Matthew on this issue, it's not a security issue by default and if a user intentionally opens up their home directory, they should take care to chmod 700 ~/.evolution/ if they want to keep the data private.  This may make for a good enhancement for future Evolution packages or, better yet, something that upstream would take into account (since some files are protected while others are not).  Activity on the upstream bug report is non-existent.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=498648#c6)  Matthew Barnes    2009-05-26 20:19:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=498648#c4)) > This may make for a good enhancement for future Evolution packages or, better > yet, something that upstream would take into account (since some files are > protected while others are not).  Activity on the upstream bug report is > non-existent.    Certainly it's a valid bug.  We should be creating ~/.evolution with 0700 permissions.  Not sure if it's worth enforcing this for existing installs.  I'm an upstream maintainer, so I'll try to get this taken care of for the next upstream stable and development releases.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=498648#c7)  Vincent Danen    2009-05-26 22:02:59 UTC  ``` Yeah, I think on Evolution's first run it would probably be enough to create ~/.evolution as 0700 and maybe do permission checks on startup or something to enforce it.  I don't believe it's necessary to drill down and set umasks or anything (as suggested in the Debian bug report).  And no, I agree that this may not be worth the effort for existing installs as a mode 0755 home directory should not be default.  At the very best this is a low impact issue, and we could possibly defer it for future inclusion in an Evolution update if upstream agrees this is the way to go.  Thanks, Matthew.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=498648#c11)  Vincent Danen    2009-12-04 18:21:33 UTC  ``` Red Hat does not consider this to be a security issue.  By default, user home directories are created with mode 0700 permissions, which would not expose the ~/.evolution/ directory regardless of its own permissions.  If a user intentionally relaxes permissions on their home directory, they should be auditing all files and directories in order to not expose unwanted files to other local users.   ``` |  |

Hmmm.  Would it be a good idea to set ~/.evolution to 700 perhaps?  Or
just adopt a restrictive umask for the whole of evolution (mail being
a rather more sensitive application than most)?

Many site policies are for home directories to be world or group
readable, and trusting users not to be stupid with their permissions.
Unfortunately this breaks down when the applications themselves are
stupid.

This affects upstream as well, as verified by several installations of
deadrat and the like installed over many years at work.

Are you saying that if you change .evolution permissions to 700, they
are set back to 744 after evolution run? Because they aren't here.

If you say that evolution should create folder/files with more
restrictive defaults, I disagree. evolution should just use what the
current umask is. If you want it to another value, just set it in you
environment before running evolution (isn't that the purpose of umask
anyway?). Multi-user systems running evolution aren't that frequent, I
guess (multi-user systems aren't that frequent anyway, these days) and
you can adjust the permissions for your ~ and .evolution in a lot of
different ways. No need to add complexity to that huge stack of code.

Cheers,

Yes, I'm saying they should be created with more restrictive defaults.

Family machines?  (eg, the machine I found this bug on.  I myself wouldn't
use evolution or indeed desktop environments if I was forced at gunpoint,
but that's what mum uses.  In desktop environments, good luck setting a
sensible umask.)

What kind of complexity is

int main(...) {
   umask(0700);
   ...
}
?

Since mail (and web browser profiles - I believe firefox does this, and
opera certainly does) is about the only thing of this kind of sensitivity,
it should explicitly set mail permissions.

More sensible MTAs like alpine and mutt do this (indeed, alpine warns you
if you have silly permissions).

I didn't say there were no multi-user machines. I was just saying that
they weren't the most common environment.

Just set it in .xsessionrc.

And then you can't chose anything else if you want to, which makes me a

That actually seems quite sensible.  This being email we're talking
about.  It's either this, or audit every place evolution creates a
potentially sensitive file to pass 0600 to open().

By the way, it seems that “only” local mails are stored in a 755 folder.
At least pop and imap folders are 700:

Hi,

this issue got a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures).

[CVE-2009-1631](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1631)[0]:
| The Mailer component in Evolution 2.26.1 and earlier uses
| world-readable permissions for the .evolution directory, and certain
| directories and files under .evolution/ related to local mail, which
| allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading these
| files.

Unfortunately the vulnerability described above is not important enough
to get it fixed via regular security update in Debian stable and oldstable. It
does not warrant a DSA.

However it would be nice if this could get fixed via a regular point update[1].
Please contact the release team for this.

If you fix the vulnerability please also make sure to include the
CVE id in your changelog entry.

For further information see:

[0] <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1631>
    <http://security-tracker.debian.net/tracker/CVE-2009-1631>
[1] <http://www.debian.org/doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#upload-stable>

Cheers,
Giuseppe.

Hmhm, not sure how large and applicable the patch against 2.22.3.1
(lenny) is.

Fix is already in for unstable. testing will have it as soon as it's
built on mipsel.

In fact I'm not that sure. The previous mail said the versions prior to
2.26.1 were affected so I supposed it was fixed in 2.26.2, but in fact
it's not said in the upstream bug report so it might be a too strong
assumption, sorry.
