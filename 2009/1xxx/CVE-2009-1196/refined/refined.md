Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-1196:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-delete flaw in the CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) directory services routine. This flaw occurs when processing new data about available printers and printer classes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-after-delete:** A pointer to memory that has already been freed is accessed, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting this vulnerability. This can manifest as the `cupsd` daemon (the CUPS printing service) being stopped or crashing.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **CUPS Browse Packets:** The attack involves sending CUPS browse packets to a vulnerable machine. The attacker needs to suspend the sending of these packets and then renew them after a specific time interval.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system to send the malicious CUPS browse packets.
- **Timing:** The attack involves carefully controlling the timing of the browse packet renewal.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Swen van Brussel.
- Red Hat has issued a security advisory (RHSA-2009:1083) to address this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.
- A patch was proposed by Tim Waugh to fix this issue.
