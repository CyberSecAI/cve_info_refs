Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1523:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue in the HTTP server component of Mort Bay Jetty.
- The root cause is an error in the way canonical paths are interpreted in the URI handler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is that a remote attacker can use directory traversal sequences in the URI to access files outside the web application or document root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized File Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that are outside the intended web application directory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out through specially crafted HTTP requests containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../") in the URI.
- **Remote:** The attacker can perform this attack remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of HTTP requests and URI structures to craft malicious requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Jetty versions up to and including 6.1.16, and 7.0.0.M2 and earlier 7.x versions.
- The system is vulnerable if:
    - The DefaultServlet with support for aliases is explicitly enabled.
    - The ResourceHandler class is used to serve static content.
- On Unix-like systems, the presence of a directory name ending with a '?' character in the web application or document root is also a requirement for the exploit to work. This is not a requirement on Windows systems.
- A patch was released in Jetty version 6.1.17 to address this issue.
- Workarounds included disabling aliases for DefaultServlet and using a custom handler.
- The issue also affects Jetty 5.x, though it was addressed in 5.1.15.
