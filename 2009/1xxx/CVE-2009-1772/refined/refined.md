Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `re_route` parameter in the `/login?` URL is not sanitized before being returned to the user.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The full installation path is disclosed when testing the XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **XSS:** The application fails to properly sanitize the `re_route` parameter, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and script code.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The application reveals the full server-side path to the installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser within the context of the vulnerable website. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Other malicious activities
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** An attacker gains information about the server's filesystem, potentially aiding in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** The attacker injects malicious code into the `re_route` parameter of the `/login?` URL. This can be achieved through a crafted URL that is either clicked by the victim or embedded in another site.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** By triggering the XSS vulnerability, the full installation path is disclosed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious code in the `re_route` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to convince the user to access the crafted URL or embed it into a website visited by the target users
*   The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or access other than being able to send the crafted URL.

**Affected Versions:**
* activeCollab 2.1, corporate
* Other versions may also be affected

**Additional Notes:**
* The blog post indicates that the full path disclosure is a side-effect of testing the XSS vulnerability.
* The blog post suggests editing the source code to ensure proper input sanitization as a solution.
