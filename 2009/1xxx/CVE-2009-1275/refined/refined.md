- **Root cause of vulnerability:** EL expressions within JSP tags (tiles:putAttribute, tiles:insertTemplate) in Tiles 2.1.x are evaluated twice - once by the container and again by the ELAttributeEvaluator class.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double evaluation of EL expressions can lead to malicious exploitation if the expression is connected to user-entered content. This allows an attacker to access the server context.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of server data and potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Attack vectors:**  User-entered content, when used in EL expressions within specific Tiles JSP tags.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to influence or control user-entered content that is then used in the vulnerable EL expressions.
