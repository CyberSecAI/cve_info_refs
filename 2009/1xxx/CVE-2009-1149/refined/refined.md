Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1149:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the BLOB streaming feature in phpMyAdmin, which improperly handles crafted URL parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting/CRLF Injection:** The vulnerability allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers. This is achieved through the manipulation of URL parameters, likely by including carriage return and line feed characters (%0d%0a) to inject new headers into the response.
*   **File Inclusion:** Attackers can include arbitrary files, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code or access to sensitive information. This likely happens because the crafted URL parameters are used in a way that influences file paths within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** Attackers could potentially include arbitrary files leading to sensitive information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.
*   **HTTP Header Injection:** The injection of HTTP headers could allow an attacker to control aspects of the response such as setting cookies, cache control, or redirecting the user to malicious sites. This can be used for phishing, session hijacking, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URL Parameters:** The attack vector is through specially crafted URL parameters when utilizing the BLOB streaming feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests with malicious crafted URL parameters to the vulnerable phpMyAdmin installation. No special authentication level is mentioned, meaning an unauthenticated attacker may be able to exploit this issue.

**Affected Versions:**

*   phpMyAdmin 3.x versions since 3.1.0.0 and before 3.1.3.1 are affected.
*   phpMyAdmin 2.11.x is not affected as it lacks BLOB streaming support.

**Solution:**

*   Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 3.1.3.1 or apply the provided patch.
