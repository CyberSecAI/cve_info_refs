1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- multipath-tools
Default permissions on the multipathd socket file were to generous
and allowed any user to connect (CVE-2009-0115).
Affected products: SLES9, OES, NLD9
- bluez
The dbus package used a too permissive configuration. Therefore intended
access control for some services was not applied (CVE-2008-4311).
The new configuration denies access by default. Some dbus services may
break due to this setting and need an updated configuration as well.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3
- xntp
ntp didn't properly check the return value of the openssl function
EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0021).
Additionally a problem where ntpd refused to use keys from /etc/ntp.keys
has been fixed.
Affected products: SLES10-SP2
- apache-mod\_php4
Specially crafted strings could trigger a heap based buffer overflow
in the php mbstring extension. Attackers could potenially exploit
that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-5557).
Affected products: SLES9, OES
- apache2-mod\_php5
php 5.2.9 fixes among other things some security issues:
+ Missing bounds checks of an error in the imageRotate function of
the gd extension potentially allowed attackers to read portions of
memory (CVE-2008-5498).
+ the mbstring.func\_overload in .htaccess was applied to other virtual
hosts on th same machine (CVE-2009-0754)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- struts
Insufficient quoting of parameters allowed attackers to conduct
cross site scripting (XSS) attacks (CVE-2008-2025).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- qemu
qemu update to version 0.10.1 fixes the following security issues:
+ CVE-2008-0928: problems with range checks of block devices
+ CVE-2008-1945: problems with removable media handling
+ CVE-2008-2382: vnc server DoS
+ CVE-2008-4539: fix a heap overflow in the cirrus VGA implementation
+ CVE-2008-5714: off by one error in vnc password handling
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- libsndfile
Specially crafted CAF files could cause an integer overflow in
libsndfile (CVE-2009-0186).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- phpMyAdmin
This update of phpMyAdmin fixes multiple vulnerabilities:
+ CVE-2009-1148: directory traversal
+ CVE-2009-1149: CRLF injection
+ CVE-2009-1150: cross-site scripting
+ CVE-2009-1151: static code injection
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
