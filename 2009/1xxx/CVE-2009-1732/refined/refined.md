Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1732:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is **insufficient input sanitization** in ipplan, a web-based IP address manager and tracker. This means the application does not properly cleanse or validate user-supplied data before using it in web pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts into web pages. This is a classic XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (via XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript or other client-side scripts into ipplan web pages. When a victim views these pages, the malicious script is executed in their browser within the context of the ipplan web application.
*   **Potential for Data Theft:** Malicious scripts could potentially steal session cookies, user credentials or other sensitive data.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers may be able to alter the appearance of the website for malicious purposes.
*   **Other Malicious Activity:** The executed JavaScript could be used to perform a variety of harmful actions within the context of the user's browser session, such as redirecting the user, performing unauthorized actions, or attempting to exploit other browser vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests to the ipplan web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the input parameters that are not sufficiently sanitized by the ipplan application, which are then reflected in the web page.
*   The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user of ipplan to inject malicious code.
*   The attacker can target any user who accesses the pages where the malicious script is reflected.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Debian Security Advisory (DSA-1827-1) specifically identifies this vulnerability in ipplan and provides details for the fix in different Debian versions.
*   The advisory mentions that the issue was addressed in version 4.86a-7+lenny1 for the stable distribution (lenny) and 4.91a-1.1 for the unstable distribution (sid).
