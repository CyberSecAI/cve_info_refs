- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, which allows bypassing authentication.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerability in the authentication process, lack of input sanitization.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel. Additionally, after logging in, they can access a database backup functionality.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a specific SQL injection payload within the username and password fields.
