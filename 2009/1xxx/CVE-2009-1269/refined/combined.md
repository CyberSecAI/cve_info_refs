How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
May 01, 2009                          <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : wireshark
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-1210 CVE-2009-1268 CVE-2009-1269

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark
network traffic analyzer, which may lead to denial of service or the
execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-1210

    A format string vulnerability was discovered in the PROFINET
    dissector.

CVE-2009-1268

    The dissector for the Check Point High-Availability Protocol
    could be forced to crash.

CVE-2009-1269

    Malformed Tektronix files could lead to a crash.

The old stable distribution (etch), is only affected by the
CPHAP crash, which doesn't warrant an update on its own. The fix
will be queued up for an upcoming security update or a point release.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2-3+lenny5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wireshark packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**Date:** April 6, 2009

**Affected versions:** 0.9.6 up to and including
1.0.6

**Fixed versions:** 1.0.7

## Details

### Description

  [CVE-2009-1210](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1210)* The LDAP dissector could crash on Windows.

    ([Bug
    3262](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3262))
    Versions affected: 0.99.2 to 1.0.6
    [CVE-2009-1267](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1267)* The Check Point High-Availability Protocol (CPHAP) dissector could crash.

      ([Bug
      3269](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3269))
      Versions affected: 0.9.6 to 1.0.6
      [CVE-2009-1268](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1268)* Wireshark could crash while loading a Tektronix .rf5 file.

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by altering the HOME environment
variable or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.0.7 or later.

If are running Wireshark {{ end\_version }} or earlier (including Ethereal 0.99.0) and cannot
upgrade, you can work around each of the problems listed above by doing the
following:

* For each user that will run Wireshark (including root if you're running
  Wireshark as a privileged user), make sure the HOME environment variable
  doesnt' contain any "%" characters.
* Don't open any Tektronix K12 text or NetScreen capture files.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- IBMJava5-JRE/java-1\_5\_0-ibm
The update brings IBM Java 5 to SR9-SSU.
It fixes a lot of security issues:
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with storing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to consume a disproportionate amount of disk space resulting
in a denial-of-service condition.
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with processing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to retain temporary files resulting in a denial-of-service
condition.
CVE-2009-1103: A vulnerability in the Java Plug-in with deserializing
applets may allow an untrusted applet to escalate privileges. For
example, an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to
the user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1104: The Java Plug-in allows Javascript code that is loaded
from the localhost to connect to any port on the system. This may be
leveraged together with XSS vulnerabilities in a blended attack to
access other applications listening on ports other than the one where
the Javascript code was served from.
CVE-2009-1093: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with
initializing LDAP connections may be exploited by a remote client to
cause a denial-of-service condition on the LDAP service.
CVE-2009-1094: A vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment LDAP client
implementation may allow malicious data from an LDAP server to cause
malicious code to be unexpectedly loaded and executed on an LDAP client.
CVE-2009-1107: The Java Plugin displays a warning dialog for signed
applets. A signed applet can obscure the contents of the dialog and trick
a user into trusting the applet.
CVE-2009-1095
CVE-2009-1096: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with unpacking applets and Java Web Start applications
using the unpack200 JAR unpacking utility may allow an untrusted applet
or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted applet
may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running the untrusted
applet.
CVE-2009-1098: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing GIF images may allow an untrusted applet or
Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an
untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local
files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user
running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1099: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing fonts may allow an untrusted applet or Java
Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.
Affected products: SLES9, SLE10
- RealPlayer
RealPlayer 10 is vulnerable to a critical security problem in the flash
plugin (CVE-2007-5400). Real does not provide updated binaries of
RealPlayer 10 and SUSE is not allowed to ship RealPlayer 11. Therefore
this update disables the flash plugin by setting restrictive file system
permissions.
Affected products: NLD9, SLE10, openSUSE 10.3-11.0
- acroread/acroread\_ja
This update of acroread fixes two vulnerabilities in the JavaScript API

- cyrus-sasl
This update of cyrus-sasl improves the output of function sasl\_encode64()
by appending a 0 for string termination. The impact depends on the
application that uses sasl\_encode64(). (CVE-2009-0688)
Affected products: SLES9, OES, NLD9, SLE10, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- ethereal/wireshark
Version upgrade to Wireshark 1.0.7 to fix various vulnerabilities:

CVE-2009-1266: additional PROFINET format string bugs,
a crash in the PCNFSD dissector
Affected products: SLES9, OES, SLE10, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- ganglia-monitor-core
A stack buffer overflow in ganglia's buffer process\_path
function has been fixed. CVE-2009-0241 has
been assigned to this issue.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- ghostscript-devel
Specially crafted file could cause a heap-overflow in JBIG2 decoder
(CVE-2009-0196), an integer overflow in ICC library (CVE-2009-0792),
a buffer overflow in BaseFont writer module (CVE-2008-6679) or crash
the CCITTFax decoder (CVE-2007-6725).
The previous security update introduced a regression that broke some
printer drives. This new update fixes that issue.
Affected products: NLD9, SLES9, OES, SLE10, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libwmf
A specially crafted WMF files could crash libwmf. (CVE-2009-1364)
Affected products: NLD9, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libxine1/xine-devel
This update of libxine1 fixes an integer overflow in the qt\_error
parse\_trak\_atom() function in that leads to a heap-based overflow and
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed
Quicktime movie file. (CVE-2009-1274)
Affected products: NLD9, SLES9, SLE10, SLE11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- net-snmp
With this update of net-snmp the handling of TCP wrappers rules for
client authorization was improved, prior to this update it was possible

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
