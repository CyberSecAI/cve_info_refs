Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-1417:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `_gnutls_x509_verify_certificate()` function in `lib/x509/verify.c` within the GnuTLS library does not perform proper time checks on X.509 certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Time Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of verification for certificate validity periods (activation and expiration dates). This allows the acceptance of certificates that are not yet valid or have already expired.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Acceptance of Invalid Certificates:** Attackers can potentially use this vulnerability to present invalid certificates to systems relying on GnuTLS.
*   **Spoofing:** This could allow a malicious actor to spoof a valid certificate, potentially impersonating a legitimate service or user.
*   **Bypass security mechanisms:** By bypassing certificate validity checks, attackers may gain unauthorized access or escalate their privileges by using a compromised certificate.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attacks:** A remote attacker could exploit this by providing a crafted certificate to an application using the GnuTLS library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to present a certificate:** The attacker needs to be able to present a malicious or expired certificate to a system using GnuTLS's X.509 verification capabilities. This often involves some form of network access to a vulnerable service or client.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Romain Francoise.
*   The `gnutls-cli` utility is specifically mentioned as an example of an application affected by this issue.
*   Other applications using the vulnerable `_gnutls_x509_verify_certificate()` function may also be affected, including (a) Exim, (b) OpenLDAP, and (c) libsoup.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in GnuTLS version 2.6.6

**Summary of relevant information from the provided documents:**

*   **Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200905-04):**  Identifies CVE-2009-1417 as a vulnerability in GnuTLS where the `_gnutls_x509_verify_certificate()` function doesn't perform time checks, leading to the acceptance of invalid certificates.  It states that `gnutls-cli` can be tricked into accepting invalid certificates due to this missing check.
*   **Gentoo Bugzilla:**  Confirms the vulnerability, provides the patch, and tracks the resolution process, ultimately leading to the release of gnutls-2.6.6.  It emphasizes the lack of certificate activation and expiration checks in `gnutls-cli` and mentions that the vulnerability is caused by missing time checks in the `_gnutls_x509_verify_certificate` function within `lib/x509/verify.c`.
*   **Flexera:** The provided Flexera documents do not contain specific details on CVE-2009-1417 itself, but they do highlight that Secunia Research identifies and provides vulnerability intelligence, which includes vulnerabilities like this one.
*  **Mandriva and Vupen:** These websites provide no relevant information.
