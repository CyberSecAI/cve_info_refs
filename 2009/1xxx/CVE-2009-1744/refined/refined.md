```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Pinnacle Studio 12 handles '.hfz' files. Specifically, the 'InstallHFZ.exe' program extracts the contents of these archive files without any proper validation, thus, it is susceptible to directory traversal attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Directory Traversal",
    "Lack of input validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can overwrite arbitrary files on the target system or place malicious scripts in Startup folders, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted '.hfz' file can be created and when opened by the vulnerable software, will trigger the directory traversal during the file extraction process by `InstallHFZ.exe`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious '.hfz' file and have the user open it with the vulnerable software. This can be done locally or by socially engineering the victim into opening the file."
