```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$_GET['id']`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or complete database compromise.
- Attack vectors: HTTP GET request with a manipulated 'id' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
