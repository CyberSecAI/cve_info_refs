{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2009-1788",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer overflow in the `header_read` function, located in `src/common.c`, when parsing VOC files. This occurs because user-supplied input is used to calculate buffer sizes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application by enticing the user to open a specially crafted VOC file.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted VOC file"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malformed VOC file and induce a user to open it in a vulnerable application using the libsndfile library.",
    "additional_details": "The overflowing data is not fully attacker-controlled, but could still lead to application crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution."
