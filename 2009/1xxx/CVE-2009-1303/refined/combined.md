How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-782-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

25 June 2009

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine of Thunderbird. If a

user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into viewing malicious web

content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-1303](/security/CVE-2009-1303), [CVE-2009-1305](/security/CVE-2009-1305), [CVE-2009-1392](/security/CVE-2009-1392), [CVE-2009-1833](/security/CVE-2009-1833),

[CVE-2009-1838](/security/CVE-2009-1838))

Several flaws were discovered in the way Thunderbird processed malformed

URI schemes. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website and

had JavaScript and plugins enabled, a remote attacker could execute

arbitrary JavaScript or steal private data. ([CVE-2009-1306](/security/CVE-2009-1306), [CVE-2009-1307](/security/CVE-2009-1307),

[CVE-2009-1309](/security/CVE-2009-1309))

Cefn Hoile discovered Thunderbird did not adequately protect against

embedded third-party stylesheets. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker

could exploit this to perform script injection attacks using XBL bindings.

([CVE-2009-1308](/security/CVE-2009-1308))

Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang, and Ming Zhang discovered that

Thunderbird did not properly handle error responses when connecting to a

proxy server. If a user had JavaScript enabled while using Thunderbird to

view websites and a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive

information. ([CVE-2009-1836](/security/CVE-2009-1836))

It was discovered that Thunderbird could be made to run scripts with

elevated privileges. If a user had JavaScript enabled while having

certain non-default add-ons installed and were tricked into viewing a

malicious website, an attacker could cause a chrome privileged object, such

as the browser sidebar, to run arbitrary code via interactions with the

attacker controlled website. ([CVE-2009-1841](/security/CVE-2009-1841))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.04

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [2.0.0.22+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/2.0.0.22%2Bbuild1%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [2.0.0.22+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/2.0.0.22%2Bbuild1%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [2.0.0.22+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/2.0.0.22%2Bbuild1%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to effect

the necessary changes.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- MozillaFirefox/mozilla-xulrunner190
Firefox version upgrade to 3.0.9 to fix various security bugs.

Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- evolution
camel's NTLM SASL authentication mechanism as used by evolution
did not properly validate server's challenge packets (CVE-2009-0582).
This update also includes the following non-security fixes:
- Fixes a critical crasher in mailer component.
- Fixes creation of recurrence monthly items in GroupWise.
- Includes fixes for some usability issues.
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- freetype2
Freetype was updated to fix some integer overflows that can be exploited
remotely in conjunction with programs like a web-browser.

Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- java-1\_4\_2-ibm/IBMJava2
This update brings IBM Java 1.4.2 to Service Release 13.
It fixes lots of bugs and following security issues:
CVE-2008-3104: Security vulnerabilities in the Java
Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet that is
loaded from a remote system to circumvent network access
restrictions and establish socket connections to certain
services running on the local host, as if it were loaded
from the system that the applet is running on. This may
allow the untrusted remote applet the ability to exploit
any security vulnerabilities existing in the services it
has connected to.
CVE-2008-3112: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create arbitrary files with the
permissions of the user running the untrusted Java Web
Start application.
CVE-2008-3113: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create or delete arbitrary files with
the permissions of the user running the untrusted Java
Web Start application.
CVE-2008-3114: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to
determine the location of the Java Web Start cache.
CVE-2008-5350: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or
application to list the contents of the home directory of
the user running the applet or application.
CVE-2008-5346: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an
untrusted applet or application to read arbitrary memory
locations in the process that the applet or application is
running in.
CVE-2008-5343: A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java
Plug-in may allow hidden code on a host to make network
connections to that host and to hijack HTTP sessions using
cookies stored in the browser.
CVE-2008-5344: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with applet classloading may allow an
untrusted applet to read arbitrary files on a system that
the applet runs on and make network connections to hosts
other than the host it was loaded from.
CVE-2008-5359: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow
an untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges.
For example, an untrusted applet may grant itself
permissions to read and write local files or execute local
applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5339: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java Web Start
application to make network connections to hosts other than
the host that the application is downloaded from.
CVE-2008-5340: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with launching Java Web Start applications may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted application may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted application.
CVE-2008-5348: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with authenticating users through
Kerberos may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) to the
system as a whole, due to excessive consumption of
operating system resources.
CVE-2008-2086: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow
certain trusted operations to be performed, such as
modifying system properties.
CVE-2008-5345: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows
code loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost.
This may allow code that is maliciously placed on the local
filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network
access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed if
the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be
leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains
that map a name to the localhost).
CVE-2008-5351: The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8)
decoder in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts
encodings that are longer than the "shortest" form. This
behavior is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may
be leveraged to exploit systems running software that
relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form
sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be
decoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that
are not otherwise accessible to be read, if the URIs are
not checked following UTF-8 decoding.
CVE-2008-5360: The Java Runtime Environment creates
temporary files with insufficiently random names. This may
be leveraged to write JAR files which may then be loaded as
untrusted applets and Java Web Start applications to access
and provide services from localhost and hence steal cookies.
CVE-2008-5353: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects
may allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5356: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5354: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java
application that is launched through the command line to
escalate privileges. For example, the untrusted Java
application may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are
accessible to the user running the untrusted Java
application.
This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or
Java Web Start application.
CVE-2008-5357: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5342: A security vulnerability in the the Java Web
Start BasicService allows untrusted applications that are
downloaded from another system to request local files to be
displayed by the browser of the user running the untrusted
application.
Affected products: SUSE CORE 9, SLE 10

Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libopenssl-devel/openssl/compat-openssl097g
This update of openssl fixes the following problems:
- CVE-2009-0590: ASN1\_STRING\_print\_ex() function allows remote denial
of service
- CVE-2009-0591: CMS\_verify() function allows signatures to look valid
- CVE-2009-0789: denial of service due to malformed ASN.1 structures
Affected products: SLES 9, SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libsoup
Large strings could lead to a heap overflow in the base64 encoding and
decoding functions. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0585).
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, POS 9, OES, SLES 9, SLE 10
- opensc/libopensc2
Private data objects on smartcards initialized with OpenSC could be
accessed without authentication (CVE-2009-0368).
Only blank cards initialized with OpenSC are affected by this
problem. Affected cards need to be manually fixed, updating the
opensc package alone is not sufficient!
Please carefully read and follow the instructions on the following
web site if you are using PIN protected private data objects on
smart cards other than Oberthur, and you have initialized those
cards using OpenSC:
<http://en.opensuse.org/Smart_Cards/Advisories>
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- python-crypto
Missing checks for the key length in the ARC2 module potentially allowed
attackers to crash applications using python-crypto or potentially even
cause execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0544).
Affected products: SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- unbound
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow in the
ldns\_rr\_new\_frm\_str\_internal()
function. This allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
DNS resource record (RR) with a long class field and possibly TTL field.
(CVE-2009-1086)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could lead to crashes, make the viewer
run into an infinite loop or potentially even allow execution of

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0437)

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
(CVE-2009-1303, CVE-2009-1305)

Several flaws were found in the way malformed web content was processed. A
web page containing malicious content could execute arbitrary JavaScript in
the context of the site, possibly presenting misleading data to a user, or
stealing sensitive information such as login credentials. (CVE-2009-0652,
CVE-2009-1306, CVE-2009-1307, CVE-2009-1309, CVE-2009-1312)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey saved certain web pages to a local
file. If a user saved the inner frame of a web page containing POST data,
the POST data could be revealed to the inner frame, possibly surrendering
sensitive information such as login credentials. (CVE-2009-1311)

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Attached image
[testcase (crashes Firefox within a minute)](attachment.cgi?id=336942)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=336942&action=edit)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Load the testcase from a file: URL.
2. Wait 5-60 seconds.
Result: Some kind of crash under nsSVGElement::BindToTree. It may involve calling a bogus memory address.
You'll probably also see some of these assertions:
###!!! ASSERTION: No callbacks should be registered while we set up this entry: '!entry->HasContentChangeCallback()', file /Users/jruderman/central/content/base/src/nsDocument.cpp, line 3288
###!!! ASSERTION: Please remove this from the document properly: '!IsInDoc()', file /Users/jruderman/central/content/base/src/nsGenericElement.cpp, line 1743
###!!! ASSERTION: Already have a document. Unbind first!: '!GetCurrentDoc() && !IsInDoc()', file /Users/jruderman/central/content/base/src/nsGenericDOMDataNode.cpp, line 585
###!!! ASSERTION: Shallow unbind won't clear document and binding parent on kids!: 'aDeep || (!GetCurrentDoc() && !GetBindingParent())', file /Users/jruderman/central/content/base/src/nsGenericElement.cpp, line 2730
###!!! ASSERTION: Bound to wrong document: 'aDocument == GetCurrentDoc()', file /Users/jruderman/central/content/base/src/nsGenericElement.cpp, line 2717
###!!! ASSERTION: Bound to wrong parent: 'aParent == GetParent()', file /Users/jruderman/central/content/base/src/nsGenericElement.cpp, line 2718
The testcase is loosely based on dynamic-use-01.svg, one of the most evil reftests in the Mozilla tree.

I couldn't get it to crash but I did see various assertions.
Does this fix the crash for you?

Sorry, I couldn't figure out how to fix it. I knew that patch? was incorrect but [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=453736#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FIX]Crash under nsSVGElement::BindToTree with <svg:use>, <svg:script>") showed I wasn't even in the right ball park.
The 1.9.0 code is totally different so its unlikely to be affected but then I couldn't get the 1.9.1 code to crash (just assert lots) so I guess the scary bit might well be mac only.

Attached patch

[Fix](attachment.cgi?id=345442&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=345442&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=453736&attachment=345442)

Two things going on here. First of all, nsSVGScriptElement::Clone has never been implemented correctly. In particular it never copied the mIsEvaluaed state. Second, the fix for [bug 343730](/show_bug.cgi?id=343730 "RESOLVED FIXED - Scripts should not fire synchronously in BindToTree (was: \"ASSERTION: Bound to wrong document\")") didn't remove the members that shadow nsIScriptElement.
So without this patch what happens in some cases is that when the <use> frame is constructed we clone the script, bind it to tree, and immediately execute it (during frame construction!).
This should be simple to trigger by toggling the <use> from display:none to a visible display value, I bet. I'll see what I can do about creating a crashtest, or even just mochitest (or both), based on that if Jesse doesn't get to it first.Assignee: nobody → bzbarsky

Fix
This looks good in and of itself, but i'm less sure this is enough to fix the bug.
Isn't there a risk that we'll end up cloning a unevaluated script somehow? Actually, it looks like if there is a <noframes> element somewhere up the parent chain the script will never evaluate or get marked as evaluated.
We should probably make ns{HTML|SVG}ScriptElement do something more drastic if there aren't any scriptblockers when we're inside BindToTree?
We might also want to add scriptblockers while <use> is calling BindToTree (which is what I assume is happening here?)

Not with <use>, as far as I can see.
> Actually, it looks like if there is a <noframes> element somewhere up the

How so? In HTML it won't even get parsed into an HTMLScriptElement. In XHTML I think it'll just run, no?
> We should probably make ns{HTML|SVG}ScriptElement do something more drastic if

We could also do that, sure. I think we need the patch in this bug as a bare minimum.

> (which is what I assume is happening here?)
<use> is not. The frame constructor code that calls into nsIAnonymousContentCreator is.

Not if you build the DOM using appendChild etc. See

Shouldn't the frame ctor code have installed scriptblockers while doing this then?
Though on second thought in general I don't think we ever want to execute scripts inside a <use>, so simply adding scriptblockers isn't what we want.

Ugh. I agree; we should fix that. You want me to roll it into this patch?

Possible... This is happening under restyle processing, so maybe we should install a scriptblocker around that whole loop, independently of what we do with <use>?

Attached patch

[Address review comments](attachment.cgi?id=352740&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=352740&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=453736&attachment=352740)

This makes the following changes:
1) Set mIsEvaluated if we bail out because of a non-scripting container.
2) Fix the SVG cloning bug.
3) Add/remove script blocker around the whole body of ProcessPendingRestyles.
4) Add/remove script blockers in the Begin/EndUpdate in CSSFC.
Part 4 is mostly for safety, since those methods must be called whenever we twiddle the frame tree, and it's good to have script blocked at those points. I still did #3 just so we don't run the script (if any) partway though ProcessPendingRestyles.
Note that the various frame construction code already asserts that we're in an update, so this means we'll now also be blocking scripts in it in all cases. That's good. ;)
This does mean that in some cases we'll block mutation events in anon content when we didn't use to, but I think we want that change. It should be reasonably safe, even for branches, right?

Daniel, it should be pretty simple to modify the testcase to assert and crash on 1.9.0, I would think. I was going to request branch approvals the second after I landed this on trunk. This needs to happen on branches.

I recommend something where the script sets everything in sight display:none. That should get you nice deleted object virtual function calls. You'll have to unset that in the main testcase to get the <use> to create frames, of course.

I think Smaug has added a scriptblocker around each callsite to this function, as well as an assertion to make sure that there are scriptblockers. So this change shouldn't be needed any more.
r/sr=me with that fixed.

Actually, why are these needed? Seems like it'll break mutation events

Hmm. You're right that those might break mutation events (do we have any testcases for this?)... They're needed because there are Begin/EndUpdate callers in the frame constructor that are not tied to content updates and that are therefore not in an existing script blocker.

Actually, that might be an excellent reason not to add blockers there :)
There is at least one place [1] that can end up calling BeginUpdate without calling EndUpdate, something that would be very bad if BeginUpdate added a scriptblocker.
Though maybe things are equally bad already?

Uh, yes. That unbalanced begin without an end would break things badly. If nothing else, it would break focus. Please file a bug on that?

For my reference, smaug's change to add script blockers around ProcessPendingRestyles is in [bug 436965](/show_bug.cgi?id=436965 "RESOLVED FIXED - <iframe src=\"c:\"></iframe> triggers \"ASSERTION: This is unsafe\""). He did NOT add an assertion in ProcessPendingRestyles, but I'll do so.
As I was documenting the invariants here and adding assertions I found some more callers of some of this stuff that should have had script blockers but did not. I'll add them.Depends on: [436965](/show_bug.cgi?id=436965 "RESOLVED FIXED - <iframe src=\"c:\"></iframe> triggers \"ASSERTION: This is unsafe\"")

Er, I was wrong. There was a script blocker assert in ProcessPendingRestyles, but not in ProcessRestyledFrames, which had some non-script-blocking entry points.

OK. So basically, smaug's patch for [bug 453736](/show_bug.cgi?id=453736 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FIX]Crash under nsSVGElement::BindToTree with <svg:use>, <svg:script>") obviated the need for most of the script blocker stuff in my patch. I looked through all the Begin/EndUpdate callers in the frame constructor, and all have script blockers except the one in ProcessRestyledFrames coming from RebuildAllStyleData (added script blocker and assert) and the one in listbox code, which smaug has a patch for elsewhere anyway, as I recall.
So the patch coming up is just items 1 and 2 from [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=453736#c12 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FIX]Crash under nsSVGElement::BindToTree with <svg:use>, <svg:script>"), plus the RebuildAllStyleData change.
I do think we should land this on all of m-c, 1.9.1, 1.9.0. I'll probably try to write a 1.8 patch for just item 2 (and maybe item 1) from [comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=453736#c12 "VERIFIED FIXED - [FIX]Crash under nsSVGElement::BindToTree with <svg:use>, <svg:script>") as well.

We'll take this on the 1.8 branch when it's fixed on 1.9.0, not blocking for the current 1.8.1.21 release (which has rough parity to the code-frozen 1.9.0.7 release).Flags: blocking1.8.1.next+ → blocking1.8.1.next?

Backporting this to 1.9.0 depended on that change, but now that's happened. I'll try to post 1.9.0 and 1.8.1 patches ASAP.

No; I'm just going to make the 1.8.1 patch have slightly smaller scope. No scriptblockers at all on 1.8.1, iirc, so no need to worry about managing them.

Wait, don't you need to worry about the problem that if the <script> has a <noXXX> container we won't run it in the main document, but will run it inside the <svg:use> clone?

We don't do noXXX checks on clones for HTML either, on 1.8 branch. In fact, I don't think we do them period. So no, I'm not going to worry about it.

Fun. This sent CVS orange because the patch was wrong. It replaced NS\_IMPL\_ELEMENT\_CLONE\_WITH\_INIT with a clone method that doesn't call Init(). On 1.9.0 that leads to a crash running the mochitest for this bug.
On trunk, this got fixed as part of the checkin for [bug 471551](/show_bug.cgi?id=471551 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove mBaseVal and change mAnimVal to nsAutoPtr in new style SVG string"); see [bug 471551 comment 20](/show_bug.cgi?id=471551#c20 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove mBaseVal and change mAnimVal to nsAutoPtr in new style SVG string"). Going to push the equivalent change to branches ASAP so we go green and such and then post the patches for review.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=496256#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-04-17 14:42:54 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Igor Bukanov reported a crash which affected both Firefox 2 and 3.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=496256#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-21 23:59:45 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1  Via RHSA-2009:0437 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0437.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=496256#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-22 01:43:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:0436 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0436.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=496256#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-04-22 20:24:55 UTC  ``` xulrunner-1.9.0.9-1.fc9, firefox-3.0.9-1.fc9, epiphany-extensions-2.22.1-10.fc9, epiphany-2.22.2-10.fc9, blam-1.8.5-8.fc9.1, chmsee-1.0.1-11.fc9, devhelp-0.19.1-11.fc9, evolution-rss-0.1.0-10.fc9, galeon-2.0.7-9.fc9, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-26.fc9, gnome-web-photo-0.3-20.fc9, google-gadgets-0.10.5-5.fc9, gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-28.fc9, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc9.1, Miro-2.0.3-3.fc9, mozvoikko-0.9.5-9.fc9, mugshot-1.2.2-8.fc9, ruby-gnome2-0.17.0-8.fc9, totem-2.23.2-14.fc9, yelp-2.22.1-11.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.

    to Javascript URIs, resulting in cross-site scripting.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.9.0.9-0lenny2.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=496253#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-04-17 14:39:58 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Jesse Ruderman reported a crash which affected both Firefox 2 and 3   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=496253#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-21 23:59:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1  Via RHSA-2009:0437 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0437.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=496253#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-22 01:43:01 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:0436 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0436.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=496253#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-04-22 20:24:47 UTC  ``` xulrunner-1.9.0.9-1.fc9, firefox-3.0.9-1.fc9, epiphany-extensions-2.22.1-10.fc9, epiphany-2.22.2-10.fc9, blam-1.8.5-8.fc9.1, chmsee-1.0.1-11.fc9, devhelp-0.19.1-11.fc9, evolution-rss-0.1.0-10.fc9, galeon-2.0.7-9.fc9, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-26.fc9, gnome-web-photo-0.3-20.fc9, google-gadgets-0.10.5-5.fc9, gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-28.fc9, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc9.1, Miro-2.0.3-3.fc9, mozvoikko-0.9.5-9.fc9, mugshot-1.2.2-8.fc9, ruby-gnome2-0.17.0-8.fc9, totem-2.23.2-14.fc9, yelp-2.22.1-11.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-0lenny1.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported mail client.

For the testing (squeeze) distribution these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-14

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.0.9)

Announced
April 21, 2009
Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.9
* SeaMonkey 1.1.16
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.22

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several stability bugs in
the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out
the possibility that for some of these an attacker might be able to
prepare memory for exploitation through some means other than
JavaScript such as large images.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.
