Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1840:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Firefox XUL (XML User Interface Language) scripts were not being subjected to certain security checks when loaded. Specifically, two key checks, intended to verify that content loading policies would not be violated, were skipped.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing content policy checks:** XUL scripts were being loaded without proper checks to ensure they adhere to content loading policies.
- **Bypassed security restrictions:**  Because of the missing checks, scripts could be loaded even when they should have been blocked by content policies (e.g., JavaScript disabled).
- **Privilege escalation:** This vulnerability allowed malicious content to bypass restrictions and potentially run JavaScript with elevated privileges.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The vulnerability allowed script loading without verifying policies, potentially executing arbitrary code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code with elevated privileges, gaining control over browser components or even the system.
- **Bypass content restrictions:** Malicious scripts could execute even when JavaScript is disabled or specific content policies are in place.
- **Exploitation of privileged add-ons:**  Privileged add-ons that relied on content policies for security were vulnerable to attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious XUL documents:** An attacker could craft a malicious XUL document containing scripts.
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker could host a malicious XUL document on a website or trick a user to download it.
- **Email-based attack:** In the case of Thunderbird, this could allow "web bugs" in emails to bypass content policies.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to deliver malicious XUL:** The attacker would need to be able to deliver a malicious XUL document to the target. This could be through web hosting, email, or other channels.
- **Basic Understanding of Firefox internals:** The attacker would need a basic knowledge on how Firefox XUL and script loading works.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Mozilla add-on developer and community member Wladimir Palant.
- The issue was fixed in Firefox 3.0.11.
- The issue was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 4 via RHSA-2009:1095.
- The vulnerability was also addressed in Fedora 10 and 9.
- NoScript was not directly affected as it has a WebProgressListener safety net.
- Patches were created and reviewed before being applied to trunk and then branches.
