Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in eZip Wizard 3.0. This occurs when the software processes a specially crafted ZIP file with an overly long filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The software doesn't properly validate the length of filenames in a ZIP archive, allowing an attacker to write beyond the boundaries of a fixed-size buffer on the stack. This overwrite can corrupt adjacent memory and overwrite the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) chain, giving the attacker control over program execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the user running eZip Wizard. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious ZIP file:** The attacker crafts a malicious ZIP archive file with a long filename.
*   **User interaction:** The victim must be convinced to open the malicious ZIP file using eZip Wizard and then access the specially crafted file usually by double-clicking it. This action triggers the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft a malicious ZIP file:** The attacker needs the technical skills to create a ZIP archive with a crafted filename.
*   **Social Engineering (or other methods of distribution):** The attacker needs to distribute the malicious ZIP to the victim and persuade the victim to open it with the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit works by overflowing the buffer and overwriting the SEH chain with a pointer to the attacker's code.
*   The provided exploit uses an egghunter to locate the shellcode within the overwritten buffer in memory.
*   The Metasploit module dynamically calculates the correct padding based on the username length since this affects the distance to the SEH record.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db.com content confirms that the vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow that can lead to remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted zip file.
*   The exploit-db.com entry also mentions that this type of vulnerability (stack buffer overflow via crafted zip files) was also found in other software such as ZipGenius and PowerZip.

**Summary:**

The content describes a classic stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in eZip Wizard 3.0 which can be triggered by opening a specially crafted ZIP file. This allows for remote code execution when a user opens a specially crafted zip file, giving attackers complete control over the system.
