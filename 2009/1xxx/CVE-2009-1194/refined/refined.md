{
  "CVE-2009-1194": {
    "description": "Integer overflow in the pango_glyph_string_set_size function in pango/glyphstring.c in Pango before 1.24 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a long glyph string that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, as demonstrated by a long document.location value in Firefox.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing overflow check when calculating the size of memory to allocate for glyph strings in the `pango_glyph_string_set_size` function. The multiplication of `string->space` with `sizeof(PangoGlyphInfo)` was not checked for an integer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service (application crash) or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the affected application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By passing an arbitrarily long string to the vulnerable function, exploiting the integer overflow and causing a heap-based buffer overflow during memory allocation.",
       "A long document.location value in Firefox is cited as an example of how this can be triggered remotely through a web browser."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to influence the length of a glyph string that is being processed by the vulnerable code. In a web context, this can be achieved by manipulating input that is eventually processed by the pango library. "
