### Summary of CVE-2009-1192

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-1192:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the failure to properly initialize memory in the AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) subsystem of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `agp_generic_alloc_page` and `agp_generic_alloc_pages` functions in `drivers/char/agp/generic.c` do not zero out allocated pages before making them available to user-space processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Information Leak:** The primary vulnerability is an information leak. Because the allocated memory is not zeroed out, it may contain sensitive data from previous kernel operations.
- **Uninitialized Memory:** The core issue lies in the use of uninitialized memory, which leads to the disclosure of potentially sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker can potentially read arbitrary kernel memory by accessing AGP pages. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data such as credentials, configuration information, or other kernel-related data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:**  The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the system in order to exploit this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Privileges:** The attacker must have local user privileges on the vulnerable system.
- **Code Execution:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code to interact with the AGP subsystem and trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**
-   **Affected Systems:** Multiple Linux distributions and SUSE products were affected, including SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP2, SUSE Linux Enterprise 9, openSUSE 11.1, Ubuntu 8.10, Ubuntu 9.04, and Debian Lenny.
-   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was addressed by applying patches that ensure the allocated AGP pages are zeroed out before being made available to user-space processes.
-   **Kernel Functions:** The specific functions that need patching are `agp_generic_alloc_page` and `agp_generic_alloc_pages` within the `drivers/char/agp/generic.c` file.
-   **CVSS Score:** The SUSE Security Announcement designated this vulnerability with a severity of 7 out of 10.

This vulnerability can be exploited by a local user with access to the affected system, but the impact is limited to information disclosure. There is no evidence of remote code execution related to this vulnerability according to these documents.
