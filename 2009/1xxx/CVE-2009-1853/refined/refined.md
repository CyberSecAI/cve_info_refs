- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `f` and `t` parameters within `index.php`, `functions/showforum.php`, and potentially `functions/showtopic.php`. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure (e.g., usernames, passwords), data modification or deletion, and potential complete compromise of the application and its underlying server.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP GET requests to `index.php` by manipulating the `f` and `t` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required.
