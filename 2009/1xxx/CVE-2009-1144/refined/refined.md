Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1144:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing definition of the `SYSTEM_XPDFRC` macro during the compilation of a repackaged version of Xpdf in Gentoo. This causes Xpdf to attempt to read its configuration file (`xpdfrc`) from the current working directory if a user-specific configuration file (`~/.xpdfrc`) is not found.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Untrusted Search Path:** Xpdf, due to the missing macro definition, searches for a configuration file in the current working directory, which can be controlled by an attacker.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The `psFile` setting within the `xpdfrc` file is evaluated in a shell. This allows an attacker to inject malicious shell commands into a crafted `xpdfrc` file, leading to arbitrary code execution when a user prints a document using Xpdf.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A local attacker could craft a malicious `xpdfrc` file and place it in a directory where a user is likely to execute the `xpdf` command. When the user opens a PDF and attempts to print it, the malicious commands in the `xpdfrc` would be executed with the user's privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can potentially gain control over the user's account, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to be able to place the malicious `xpdfrc` file in a directory where the victim user will run xpdf.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker may use social engineering to entice a user to run xpdf in a compromised directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must have local user access to the system.
*   **Ability to Create Files:** The attacker must be able to create files within a directory a victim user may use.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue is specific to the Gentoo distribution due to their repackaging of xpdf with a custom build process that does not correctly set the `SYSTEM_XPDFRC` macro.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the user prints a document after opening it in xpdf.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in `app-text/xpdf-3.02-r2` by setting the `SYSTEM_XPDFRC` macro to point to the correct system-wide configuration file path (`/etc/xpdfrc`).
*   A workaround for users of affected versions is to avoid running xpdf from untrusted directories and create their own `~/.xpdfrc` file.
