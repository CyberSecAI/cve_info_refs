  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2009-0839",
      "root_cause": "A stack-based buffer overflow occurs due to insufficient size checking when constructing a file path using sprintf(). The IMAGEPATH and NAME attributes from a map file, along with user-supplied input via the 'id' parameter, are concatenated into a fixed-size buffer without proper length validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Insufficient size checking",
        "Unvalidated user input"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. By controlling the buffer's content, an attacker can overwrite saved registers, redirect execution flow, and potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the 'mapserv' process.",
      "attack_vector": "A specially crafted map file with overly long IMAGEPATH and/or NAME attributes is placed on the server, combined with an HTTP request including the 'id' parameter. Alternatively, a long 'id' parameter without a crafted map can also trigger the overflow.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to either create or trick a legitimate user into creating a malicious map file on the server, or manipulate heap memory into a favorable state when triggering the overflow via a long 'id' parameter."
    },
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2009-0840",
        "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer underflow is caused by using a negative value for the content length from the `CONTENT_LENGTH` header. The `atoi` function interprets a `-1` and then calls `malloc` with `0` and then writes a `\\0` byte at the -1 index.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer underflow",
        "Improper input validation",
        "Use of signed integer for size calculations"
      ],
      "impact": "An out-of-bounds write on the heap, potentially leading to a crash or other undefined behavior. Although the impact of a simple zero-byte write might be limited, it could be exploited further through heap manipulation.",
      "attack_vector": "A crafted POST request with a negative `CONTENT_LENGTH` header is sent to the mapserv application.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP POST requests with arbitrary headers to the server hosting MapServer and the webserver must not sanitize the content-length field."
    },
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2009-0841",
        "root_cause": "The application does not sanitize relative file paths when creating a new file. A relative path in the 'id' parameter allows attackers to write files to arbitrary locations on the file system.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Relative path traversal",
         "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary file creation. The attacker can create or overwrite files in any location accessible to the 'mapserv' process, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vector": "A crafted HTTP request with a relative path in the 'id' parameter is sent to the server.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send an HTTP request with the 'id' parameter containing a relative file path. Depending on the platform, they might require the ability to create directories in the IMAGEPATH folder."
    },
      {
      "cve": "CVE-2009-0842",
        "root_cause": "The application leaks file contents by parsing the content of a given file in error messages. By using symlinks to sensitive files, the attacker can have the content of those files displayed in error messages.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information disclosure",
          "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Sensitive file information leakage. Attackers can read the content of arbitrary files that the webserver has access to by creating symbolic links to them and accessing the linked files via the map parameter.",
      "attack_vector": "The attacker creates a symlink to a sensitive file and then sends a request to the server with the map parameter set to the symlink. Also, any map file can be read without creating a symlink as long as the filename ends with .map",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create symbolic links on the server."
    },
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2009-0843",
      "root_cause": "The application returns different error messages depending on if the file specified in the `queryfile` parameter exists. This can be used to determine if a file exists on the file system.",
      "weaknesses": [
          "Information disclosure",
          "Insufficient error handling"
        ],
      "impact": "File existence disclosure. Attackers can determine if a file exists on the server by analyzing error messages.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker sends a request to the server with the map parameter set to a valid file and the `queryfile` set to the file the attacker wants to verify.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary requests to the mapserv CGI program."
