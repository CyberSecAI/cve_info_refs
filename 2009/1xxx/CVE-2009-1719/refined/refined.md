Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the "Aqua Look and Feel for Java" implementation on Mac OS X. Specifically, it's a pointer dereference issue in the `apple.laf.CColourUIResource(long, int, int ,int, int)` constructor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe Pointer Usage:** The constructor interprets the first `long` argument as a pointer to an Objective-C object without proper validation. This allows a malicious applet to pass an arbitrary memory address.
*   **Pointer Dereference:** When the constructor processes the supplied pointer it performs a dereference which will trigger arbitrary code execution if the pointer is pointing to a malicious memory structure

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Java applet. This could lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Elevated Privileges:** The vulnerability allows an untrusted Java applet to obtain elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Java Applet:** The primary attack vector is a maliciously crafted untrusted Java applet embedded in a webpage.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required as the victim must visit the malicious page containing the applet

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Java Applet:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a Java applet that exploits the specific vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Host Applet on Webpage:** The attacker needs to host the applet on a webpage that the victim can access.
*   **Victim Must be Using Vulnerable System:** The target system must be running a vulnerable version of Java 1.5 on Mac OS X v10.5.
*   **User interaction required:** The victim has to visit the page containing the malicious applet

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Apple by an anonymous researcher working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.
*   Apple addressed the issue by denying access to internal details of Aqua Look and Feel for untrusted Java applets.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['6800'].
*   The vulnerability only affects Java 1.5 on Mac OS X v10.5 systems.

This information provides more details than the standard CVE description, particularly in pinpointing the specific vulnerable constructor `apple.laf.CColourUIResource` and the nature of the pointer dereference.
