Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2009-1542:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper validation of privilege levels when executing specific machine instructions within the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) of Microsoft Virtual PC and Microsoft Virtual Server. Specifically, the software does not correctly verify if a machine instruction requires a certain CPU privilege level to run within the guest operating system environment. This allows user-mode applications to potentially execute instructions that should only be executed in kernel mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Privilege Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of CPU privilege levels when executing machine instructions in the virtualized environment.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability allows for a privilege escalation from user-mode within a guest operating system to potentially kernel-level execution, allowing for greater control over the guest.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to run code with elevated privileges within the guest operating system.
*   **Complete Control of Guest OS:** An attacker can gain complete control of the guest operating system, enabling them to:
    *   Install programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is primarily through a specially crafted application that is run within a guest operating system on an affected version of Microsoft Virtual PC or Microsoft Virtual Server.
*   An attacker must have already gained access to the guest virtual machine to exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the virtual machine.
*   The vulnerability is within the software emulation of hardware, not in the hardware itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest OS Access:** An attacker must have the ability to execute code within a guest operating system of an affected Virtual PC or Virtual Server product.
*   **Code Execution:** The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted application designed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability does not allow an attacker to escape from the virtualized environment to the host or other guest operating systems.
*   Deployments using Hardware Assisted Virtualization (HAV) are not affected by this vulnerability.
*   Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V, Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode on Windows 7 are not affected.
*   Microsoft recommends applying the provided updates at the earliest opportunity.
