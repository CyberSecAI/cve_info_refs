How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

<http://memcached.googlecode.com/files/memcached-1.2.8.tar.gz>

If you are running memcached version 1.2.7 in multithreaded mode, it is
\*highly recommended\* you immediately upgrade to 1.2.8.

A few bugs were fixed that warranted an immediate release of memcached
1.2.8. If you are running memcached prior to 1.2.7, please skip 1.2.7 and
upgrade straight to 1.2.8.

\*Please note\* that the critical bug noted below only affects memcached
binaries built with --enable-threads. While highly recommended, this is
not the default in the 1.2 series. It is the default in 1.3.

commit b8a39193ea9b62bd0293f345f07dfcd7e942f82f
Author: dormando <dorm...@rydia.net>
Date: Fri Apr 10 23:02:14 2009 -0700

fix resumption of accept loop under multithread

critical fix:
 under multithreaded mode, in version 1.2.7, memcached would not resume
 accepting connections after hitting the max connections limit.

this is due to a pre-existing bug in the accept\_new\_conns code, which
 was hit when the "fix" was rolled in to ensure listening threads never
 did real work.
 Previously, at least one closing connection would (randomly) be on the
 accepting thread, so the test for (are we the listening thread?) would
 still work.

Author: dormando <dorm...@rydia.net>
Date: Fri Apr 10 21:10:36 2009 -0700

-b now works.

Author: dormando <dorm...@rydia.net>
Date: Fri Apr 10 23:13:50 2009 -0700

remove 'stats maps' command.

(a longshot security issue was reported). If a buffer overrun is ever
 found in memcached, and you allow people to run 'stats maps', they
 could potentially do evil.

---

I take full responsibility for the botched release of 1.2.7, and apologize
profusely to the memcached community. I understand and highly value the
point of automated testing, but failed to test this feature before
release. I also somehow included a botched version of the -b command.

Full kudos goes to Dustin Sallings for attempting to test the connection
limit issue and running into the problem. Also for dealing with the
mini-freakout I launched into in IRC while trying to decide how to best
deal with the issue.

We will be doing more extensive reworking to the startup codepath for
memcached in the coming days. For this release I have written tests to
verify the features, but the tests are not viable for inclusion in the
test suite. The reason for this is a long and boring so I'll exclude the
discussion from this release announcement.

Thanks,
-Dormando

                  Security Advisory #2009-001
         Memcached and MemcacheDB ASLR Bypass Weakness

Author:  Joe Testa <jt _at_sign_ positronsecurity_dot_com>
Date:    April 28th, 2009
URL:     <<http://www.positronsecurity.com/advisories/2009-001.html>>

I. Executive Summary

    Memcached [[1]](#cite_note-1) is a popular open-source, multi-platform database-
caching software program used to alleviate repetitive database
operations.  It was originally developed by Danga Interactive [[2]](#cite_note-2).
MemcacheDB [[3]](#cite_note-3) is a fork of the memcached project which adds
persistent storage using the BerkeleyDB database engine [[4]](#cite_note-4).

    An implementation weakness that impacts security was identified
in memcached v1.2.7 and MemcacheDB v1.2.0.  Users in high-security
environments should consider upgrading to memcached v1.2.8 and/or
a fixed version of MemcacheDB to protect against potential attacks.

II. Overview

    During an audit of the memcached v1.2.7 source code, it was
found that the software divulges its stack, heap, and shared library
memory locations.  This effectively disables address space layout
randomization (ASLR) [[5]](#cite_note-5) protection, making potential buffer overflow
vulnerabilities much easier to exploit.  The same behavior exists in
MemcacheDB v1.2.0.

III. Detailed Description

    By simply connecting to the memcached TCP port (default: 11211)
or MemcacheDB's TCP port (default: 21201) and issuing a 'stats maps'
command, the software will directly pipe the output of
/proc/self/maps to the client (see memcached.c:1153 and
memcachedb.c:946).

    Since neither memcached nor MemcacheDB do any authentication, a
well-known requirement is that the services must never be accessible
by untrusted machines.  If an untrusted machine were to access the
services, then any contents of the cache could be read and/or
modified; arbitrary data could be inserted as well.

    Even in light of this requirement, it remains reasonable for an
administrator to expect that using these pieces of software would
not allow a trusted machine to execute arbitrary code.  By extension,
it remains reasonable for an administrator to rely on ASLR protections
to thwart any potential buffer overflow attacks.  Because of these
reasonable assumptions, and because no explicit documentation warns
users of this non-obvious feature and its non-obvious impact, this
issue qualifies as a security weakness.

    This issue has been assigned the following CVE ID: [CVE-2009-1255](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1255).

IV. Solution

    The offending functionality was removed from the software, thus
reinstating ASLR protection.  Users in high-security environments may
consider upgrading to better protect against potential buffer
overflow vulnerabilities.

    memcached v1.2.8 was released to address this issue and can be
downloaded at
<<http://memcached.googlecode.com/files/memcached-1.2.8.tar.gz>>.  The
official release announcement can be viewed at
<[http://groups.google.com/group/memcached/browse_thread/thread/ \](http://groups.google.com/group/memcached/browse_thread/thread/ff96a9b88fb5d40e)
[ff96a9b88fb5d40e](http://groups.google.com/group/memcached/browse_thread/thread/ff96a9b88fb5d40e)>.

    The maintainer of MemcacheDB claimed to fix the issue in the
code repository, but unfortunately, has not released a stable
package containing it (see section V below for details).  In the
meantime, the following unofficial patch can be applied to the
source tree of MemcacheDB v1.2.0:

    The above patch can be applied to the MemcacheDB v1.2.0
sources with:

        $ cd memcachedb-1.2.0
        $ patch < ../memcachedb.patch

    The source tree must then be re-compiled and the existing
vulnerable 'memcachedb' binary replaced with the fixed result.

V. Vendor Timeline

    Contacting the vendor of memcached proved difficult at first
because the contents of the packaged AUTHORS file was apparently
out of date.  Once the proper maintainer was located (Dormando),
the issue was fixed quickly.

    The maintainer of MemcacheDB fixed the problem quickly in the
source code repository, but never released a fixed stable version
after claiming one was on the way; subsequent attempts to contact
the maintainer have been ignored.

    March 31st, 2009:  Using the contents of the packaged AUTHORS
                       file, Brad Fitzpatrick and Anatoly Vorobey
                       were notified via e-mail.

    April 7th, 2009:   After receiving no reply from the official
                       maintainers, a request to contact any
                       acting maintainer(s) was made to the memcached
                       mailing list at <http://groups.google.com/ \
                       group/memcached/browse_thread/thread/ \
                       ff92b3d1a6191e4d#>.  Dormando identified
                       himself as a maintainer via e-mail, and was
                       notified of the issue.

    April 10th, 2009:  Dormando released v1.2.8 to resolve the issue.

    April 13th, 2009:  Steve Chu, the maintainer of MemcacheDB, was
                       notified of the issue.  He replied that he
                       would fix it.

    April 14th, 2009:  Steve Chu sent notification that the issue
                       was fixed in the code repository and provided
                       the following link:  <[http://code.google.com/](http://code.google.com/p/memcachedb/source/detail?r=98) \
                       [p/memcachedb/source/detail?r=98](http://code.google.com/p/memcachedb/source/detail?r=98)>.

    April 15th, 2009:  Steve Chu was asked when a stable release would
                       be available.

    April 17th, 2009:  Steve Chu was again asked when a stable release
                       would be available.

    April 18th, 2009:  Steve Chu indicated that a stable release
                       containing the fix would be available "a couple
                       of days later."

    April 24th, 2009:  An update was requested from Steve Chu regarding
                       the release date for the fixed stable version
                       of MemcacheDB.  As of April 28th, 2009, no reply
                       was received.
