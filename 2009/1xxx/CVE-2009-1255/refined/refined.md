The provided content pertains to CVE-2009-1255.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the memcached and MemcacheDB software divulging their memory layout (stack, heap, and shared library locations) through the `stats maps` command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information disclosure: The `stats maps` command reveals memory addresses, effectively disabling ASLR.
- Lack of authentication: Both memcached and MemcacheDB lack authentication, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access if exposed to untrusted networks.
- Non-obvious functionality: The `stats maps` command is not well-documented and its security impact is not obvious.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Disabling ASLR: Exposing memory layout information makes it easier to exploit potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
- Arbitrary code execution: By disabling ASLR, an attacker with a buffer overflow exploit could execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Data modification: If an untrusted machine has access, an attacker could read and modify cached data or insert arbitrary data into the cache.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: An attacker could connect to the memcached or MemcacheDB TCP port and issue a `stats maps` command.
- Local access: A local user could connect to the TCP port and issue the `stats maps` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the memcached or MemcacheDB TCP ports, or local access
- Ability to send commands to the service via its TCP port
- Knowledge of the `stats maps` command.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in memcached v1.2.7 and MemcacheDB v1.2.0.
- memcached v1.2.8 was released to address the issue by removing the offending functionality
- A patch is provided for MemcacheDB v1.2.0 users.
- The vulnerability was discovered during a source code audit.
