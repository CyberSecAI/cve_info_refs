{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files based on user-controlled parameters without proper sanitization, leading to local file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially revealing sensitive information like configuration files, passwords, or source code.",
    "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `row_mysql_blocks_center_down['file']`, `row_mysql_blocks_center_top['file']`, `row_mysql_blocks_left['file']`, `row_mysql_blocks_right['file']` and `row_mysql_bloginfo['theme']` parameters in the GET requests to the vulnerable PHP scripts.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No prior authentication or special privileges are needed."
