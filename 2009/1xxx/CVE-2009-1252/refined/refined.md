| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1151#c0)  Harlan Stenn    2009-04-09 07:44:41 UTC  ```   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1151#c1)  Harlan Stenn    2009-04-09 07:46:30 UTC  ``` Blocking 4.2.4 and 4.2.6.  Details in the morning... ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1151#c2)  Harlan Stenn    2009-04-22 22:02:05 UTC  ``` This bug was fixed in -dev around p75 or so. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1151#c3)  Harlan Stenn    2009-04-30 22:00:55 UTC  ``` Due to the use of sprintf() calls in ntp_crypto.c it was possible to craft a packet with an extension field that would either cause ntpd to crash or result in the execution of arbitrary code (with the privileges of the ntp daemon process).  This vulnerability exists in ntp-4.2.4p6 and before.  The fix for this problem will be released in ntp-stable on 2009-05-04.  This vulnerability exists in ntp-4.2.5p73 and before.  This vulnerability was fixed in ntp-dev as part of a code cleanup that was committed on 2007-09-10.  If ntpd was not built with OpenSSL the vulnerability does not exist.  If ntpd was build with OpenSSL but there is no \"crypto pw whatever\" line in the ntp.conf file, the vulnerability is not exploitable.  This vulnerability was discovered by Chris Ries of CMU. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1151#c4)  Harlan Stenn    2009-05-18 09:59:36 UTC  ``` This bug has been fixed in 4.2.4p7.  Making this a \"public\" bug. ``` |  |
