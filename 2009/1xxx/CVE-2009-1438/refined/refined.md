  "CVE-2009-1438": {
    "description": "Integer overflow in the CSoundFile::ReadMed function (src/load_med.cpp) in libmodplug before 0.8.6, as used in gstreamer-plugins and other products, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a MED file with a crafted (1) song comment or (2) song name, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "An integer overflow in the `CSoundFile::ReadMed` function within `src/load_med.cpp` when parsing MED files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow",
        "Heap-based buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution due to a heap-based buffer overflow.  Applications using libmodplug can crash or be compromised. Could lead to a denial of service or execution of arbitrary code.",
       "attack_vectors": "By enticing a user to open a specially crafted MED file. This could be done via a malformed song comment or song name field within the file.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted MED file with an oversized song comment or song name that exploits the integer overflow vulnerability.",
      "required_position": "The attacker can be remote, only requiring the user to open the malicious file."
