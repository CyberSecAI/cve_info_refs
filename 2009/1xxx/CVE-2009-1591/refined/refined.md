Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2009-1591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input when constructing HTTP headers in the Web Mailer application from CGI RESCUE. This lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTTP Header Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious HTTP headers into the response generated by the web application. This occurs because the application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied data used when constructing the HTTP headers.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in HTTP headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Falsified Information:** An attacker can use header injection to inject malicious code into the web response, leading to the display of falsified information to users.
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML into the HTTP response headers, causing the user's browser to execute arbitrary scripts.
- **HTTP Response Splitting:** An attacker could potentially perform HTTP response splitting attacks, leading to further malicious outcomes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network through the web interface of the vulnerable application.
- Attackers inject malicious content into the user-supplied data that influences HTTP header construction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the web application and the ability to inject malicious input through the application's user interface.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
