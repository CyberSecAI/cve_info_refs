Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `DoRcvRpcCall` RPC function of the `rep_srv.exe` process in EMC RepliStor. This function listens on TCP port 7144 by default.
*   Specifically, when handling opcode 36, the function uses `CreateProcessW` with user-supplied arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unvalidated Input:** The `DoRcvRpcCall` function takes user-supplied arguments without proper validation when calling `CreateProcessW`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The lack of input sanitization combined with the use of `CreateProcessW` directly enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SYSTEM user. This means the attacker has complete control over the affected system, allowing them to install malware, steal data, or disrupt operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability over the network by sending specially crafted RPC requests to the vulnerable `rep_srv.exe` service on TCP port 7144.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring authentication, making it easily accessible to attackers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target system running the vulnerable EMC RepliStor service.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the RPC protocol used by RepliStor and the structure of the exploit to craft malicious requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '6904'.
*   EMC released a Security Alert (ESA) identifier ESA-09-003 to customers through Powerlink.
