  "CVE-2009-1833": {
    "description": "Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. Jesse Ruderman, Adam Hauner, and Igor Bukanov reported crashes in the Firefox 3 JavaScript engine.",
    "root_cause": "Crashes in the Firefox 3 JavaScript engine due to stability issues that may lead to arbitrary code execution through memory corruption.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption",
      "Arbitrary code execution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by exploiting the memory corruption vulnerability. This could allow them to take control of the user's system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Loading malicious JavaScript through browser",
       "Exploiting a chain of JavaScript engine vulnerabilities"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to inject or convince the user to load malicious JavaScript code through browser."
