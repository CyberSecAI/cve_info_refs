{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive files on the server via LFI and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser via XSS.",
  "Attack vectors": {
        "LFI": "By manipulating the 'show' parameter in the URL to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., '../../../../../../etc/passwd%00').",
        "XSS": "By injecting malicious JavaScript into the 'PID' parameter in the URL (e.g., 'index.php?PID=\"<script>alert(\"test\")</script>')"
    },
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application, which is accessible over the network."
