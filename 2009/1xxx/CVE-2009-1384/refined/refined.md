Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1384:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the `pam_krb5` module, used for Kerberos-based user authentication, handles password prompts when attempting to authenticate users. The module exhibits different behavior when prompted for the password of an existing user versus a non-existent user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The varying password prompts for existent and non-existent users reveal whether a given username is valid on the system. This leaks user enumeration information.
- **User Enumeration:** The ability to distinguish between existing and non-existent users enables an attacker to compile a list of valid usernames, facilitating targeted attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Increased Attack Surface:** The vulnerability makes it easier for attackers to focus their efforts on valid users.
- **Password Guessing Attacks:** With a list of valid usernames, attackers can conduct dictionary-based password guessing attacks, increasing the chance of successful compromise.
- **Compromised Accounts:** If a valid user has a weak password, the vulnerability makes it easier for the attacker to compromise the account.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** A remote attacker can initiate an authentication attempt against a service using `pam_krb5` to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Direct Login:** An attacker attempting to log into the system via a service using `pam_krb5` can exploit this vulnerability as well.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to reach a system or service utilizing `pam_krb5` for authentication.
- **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker must be aware that the target system is using the `pam_krb5` module for authentication.
- **Username Guessing:** An attacker would generally start with a list of possible usernames to probe the system and confirm existence.

**Additional Details (Beyond the CVE Description):**

- **Specific PAM Configurations:** The vulnerability is present under specific configurations:
    - When `pam_krb5.so` is the only authentication module used.
    - When `pam_krb5.so` is used before the standard Unix authentication module (`pam_unix.so`).
- **Mitigation:**  The vulnerability can be mitigated by using the default PAM configuration generated by the `authconfig` interface, which properly configures the authentication order.
- **Affected Versions:** The issue affects `pam_krb5` versions starting from 2.2.14 and newer. Versions prior to and including 2.1.17 are not vulnerable.
- **Affected Products:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is affected, while Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3 and 4 are not. This vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via RHSA-2010:0258. It also affected Fedora 9, 10 and 11.
- **VMware:** This vulnerability was also addressed by VMware in VMSA-2011-0003 as part of a pam_krb5 library update in ESX.
