Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2009-1947, as identified within the provided exploit-db.com entry:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2009-1947 (along with CVE-2009-1948 and CVE-2009-1949)

*   **Affected Software:** Unclassified NewsBoard version 1.6.4 (and possibly lower)

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability related to this CVE is a **Remote SQL Injection** issue. This is due to a flaw in the `UnbDbEncode` function when used with the `$forLIKE` parameter set to true. This improper escaping of special characters within SQL queries leads to a bypass of sanitization and makes SQL injection possible.

*   **Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The `UnbDbEncode` function incorrectly sanitizes user-supplied input when the `$forLIKE` parameter is true, specifically within the search functionality, allowing for SQL Injection attacks.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `Query` parameter within the search functionality.
    *   Specifically, the `InSubject` and `InMessage` parameters are used in conjunction with the `Query` parameter to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   An attacker can inject malicious SQL code by manipulating these parameters

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive database information, including usernames, passwords, and other data.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data from the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** If administrative credentials are leaked, an attacker could gain complete control of the application and server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   No special user-level access is required, and the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Code:**
    *   `unb_lib/database.lib.php`: The `UnbDbEncode` function is vulnerable when `$forLIKE` is true, due to double escaping.
    *   `unb_lib/search.inc.php`:  The search query construction, specifically when searching `InSubject` and `InMessage` which makes use of the flawed `UnbDbEncode` function.
*   **Exploitation:**
    *   The exploit involves crafting a malicious SQL injection query via the `Query` parameter.
    *   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject SQL by crafting a specific URL. Example:
        ```
        [host]/[path]/forum.php?req=search&Query=xxx'))OR/**/1=1%23&ResultView=2&InMessage=1&Sort=2&Forum=0
        ```
        
*   **Additional Notes:**
    * The exploit code also contains techniques to leverage additional vulnerabilities (File inclusion, Log disclosure). These are not related to CVE-2009-1947
    * The exploit includes code that leverages path disclosure vulnerabilities, which is a different vulnerability than the SQL Injection
    * A Perl exploit script is included that automates the SQL injection process to retrieve user credentials.

**Summary:**

The primary vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1947 in Unclassified NewsBoard 1.6.4 is a remote SQL injection flaw in the search functionality due to incorrect sanitization of user-supplied input in the `UnbDbEncode` function. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or the server itself.
