## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)

## Packages

* [php5](/security/cves?package=php5) -

## Details

USN-761-1 fixed vulnerabilities in PHP.

This update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 9.04.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that PHP did not sanitize certain error messages when

display\_errors is enabled, which could result in browsers becoming

vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output.

With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into

viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker

could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data

(such as passwords), within the same domain. ([CVE-2008-5814](/security/CVE-2008-5814))

It was discovered that PHP did not properly handle certain malformed

strings when being parsed by the json\_decode function. A remote attacker

could exploit this flaw and cause the PHP server to crash, resulting in a

denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 and 8.10.

([CVE-2009-1271](/security/CVE-2009-1271))

Debian Bugs    : 507101 507857 508021 511493 523028 523049

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the PHP 5
hypertext preprocessor. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems.

The following four vulnerabilities have already been fixed in the stable
(lenny) version of php5 prior to the release of lenny. This update now
addresses them for etch (oldstable) aswell:

CVE-2008-2107 / CVE-2008-2108

    The GENERATE_SEED macro has several problems that make predicting
    generated random numbers easier, facilitating attacks against measures
    that use rand() or mt_rand() as part of a protection.

CVE-2008-5557

    A buffer overflow in the mbstring extension allows attackers to execute
    arbitrary code via a crafted string containing an HTML entity.

CVE-2008-5624

    The page_uid and page_gid variables are not correctly set, allowing
    use of some functionality intended to be restricted to root.

CVE-2008-5658

    Directory traversal vulnerability in the ZipArchive::extractTo function
    allows attackers to write arbitrary files via a ZIP file with a file
    whose name contains .. (dot dot) sequences.

This update also addresses the following three vulnerabilities for both
oldstable (etch) and stable (lenny):

CVE-2008-5814

    Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, when display_errors is enabled,
    allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2009-0754

    When running on Apache, PHP allows local users to modify behavior of
    other sites hosted on the same web server by modifying the
    mbstring.func_overload setting within .htaccess, which causes this
    setting to be applied to other virtual hosts on the same server.

CVE-2009-1271

    The JSON_parser function allows a denial of service (segmentation fault)
    via a malformed string to the json_decode API function.

Furthermore, two updates originally scheduled for the next point update for
oldstable are included in the etch package:

  * Let PHP use the system timezone database instead of the embedded
    timezone database which is out of date.

  * From the source tarball, the unused 'dbase' module has been removed
    which contained licensing problems.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.0+dfsg-8+etch15.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.9.dfsg.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 package.

Subject: CVE request: PHP 5.2.9

Hi!

PHP 5.2.9 was released some time ago, mentioning couple of security
fixes, that do not seem to have CVEs assigned:
  <http://www.php.net/releases/5_2_9.php>

# Fixed explode() behavior with empty string to respect negative limit.
  (Shire)
<http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/standard/string.c?r1=1.445.2.14.2.77&r2=1.445.2.14.2.78>

Our maintainer has asked upstream about this one, as it changes
behavior of explode() and does not have obvious security consequences.
Upstream security team confirmed that this one was tagged as security
by mistake.

# Fixed a crash on extract in zip when files or directories entry names
  contain a relative path. (Pierre)
<http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/zip/php_zip.c?r1=1.1.2.48&r2=1.1.2.49>

This should only affect php 5.2.7 or versions that have original fix
for CVE-2008-5658 backported.

# Fixed a segfault when malformed string is passed to json_decode().
  (Scott)
<http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/json/JSON_parser.c?r1=1.1.2.14&r2=1.1.2.15>

This is PHP 5.2.0+ only, as previous versions do not have json
extension.

Only two CVEs should be needed.  Thank you!

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1775-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Steffen Joeris
April 20, 2009                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : php-json-ext
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-1271

It was discovered that php-json-ext, a JSON serialiser for PHP, is
prone to a denial of service attack, when receiving a malformed string
via the json_decode function.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-3.2+etch1.

The stable distribution (lenny) does not contain a separate php-json-ext
package, but includes it in the php5 packages, which will be fixed soon.

The testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid)
do not contain a separate php-json-ext package, but include it in the
php5 packages.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-json-ext packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
