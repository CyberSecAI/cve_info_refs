Based on the provided documents, here's the analysis of CVE-2009-1136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the Office Web Components ActiveX control handles parameter values within Internet Explorer. Specifically, the control doesn't perform sufficient validation, which can lead to system state corruption and allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper parameter validation in the Office Web Components ActiveX control when used in Internet Explorer.
- The control's inability to handle certain parameter values correctly leads to a state where arbitrary code execution is possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve remote code execution.
- Successful exploitation grants the attacker the same user rights as the logged-on user. This can lead to a complete takeover of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with fewer user rights might experience less impact than those with administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage hosted by the attacker.
- Compromised or malicious websites, and even websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could be used to host the exploit.
- The attacker needs to lure users into visiting the malicious page. This can be achieved through links in emails, instant messages or by other methods of delivering web content such as malicious banner ads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted webpage that invokes the vulnerable ActiveX control in a way that triggers the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to host this page on a web server that the victim can access.
- Social engineering or other forms of trickery are needed to convince the victim to visit the malicious page.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is present in Microsoft Office Web Components, which are a set of COM controls for publishing spreadsheets, charts, and databases to the web.
- Microsoft was aware of limited, targeted attacks exploiting this vulnerability and has issued patches to address it.
- The advisory notes that this vulnerability was initially reported responsibly, but a public disclosure occurred later.
- The fix involves performing additional parameter validation in the control to prevent system corruption and arbitrary code execution.
- The update also includes a kill bit setting for affected versions of ISA server to block known attack vectors within Internet Explorer
- Mitigating factors include Internet Explorer's Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Server, which can reduce the risk, but is not a perfect defense.
- Workarounds include setting the kill bit for the ActiveX control and restricting web sites to trusted sites only. These workarounds disable the use of the control and may affect functionality that relies on it.
