```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The WebDAV extension in IIS does not properly decode specially crafted URLs, leading to an incorrect configuration being applied when handling the request. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication and potentially access resources that should require authentication.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: WebDAV authentication bypass vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the WebDAV extension handles HTTP requests, allowing specially crafted requests to bypass authentication requirements.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass IIS authentication requirements, potentially gaining unauthorized access to protected resources. This could involve accessing information that should only be available to authenticated users or writing files to locations where the anonymous user has write permissions. However, the attacker is still limited by the permissions granted to the anonymous user account at the file system ACL level.
- Attack vectors: By sending specially crafted anonymous HTTP requests to a web server that uses WebDAV, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The crafted URL bypasses authentication checks by exploiting the incorrect URL decoding.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as this vulnerability is about bypassing authentication. The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted URLs.

Additional details:
- The vulnerability is present in IIS versions 5.1 and 6.0 when WebDAV is enabled.
- WebDAV is not enabled by default in IIS 6.0 on Windows Server 2003.
- The anonymous user account (typically IUSR_<computername>) is used to access content.
- File system ACLs are still enforced, limiting the attacker to the permissions granted to the anonymous user.
- The vulnerability can also bypass IP and domain filters.
- Successful exploitation could allow for writing files, if the anonymous user account has write permissions on the targeted folder.
- Unicode encoding variations of the attack vector can also bypass the authentication, requiring IPS/IDS vendors to update their signatures.
