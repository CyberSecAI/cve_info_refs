## Vulnerabilities in Internet Information Services (IIS) Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (970483)

Published: June 09, 2009 | Updated: June 17, 2009

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker sent a specially crafted HTTP request to a Web site that requires authentication. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass the IIS configuration that specifies which type of authentication is allowed, but not the file system-based access control list (ACL) check that verifies whether a file is accessible by a given user. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities would still restrict the attacker to the permissions granted to the anonymous user account by the file system ACLs.

This security update is rated Important for Microsoft Internet Information Services on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that the WebDAV extension for IIS handles HTTP requests. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update addresses the vulnerability described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 971492](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/971492).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

## IIS 5.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1122

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the WebDAV extension for IIS handles HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted anonymous HTTP request to gain access to a location that should require authentication.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-1122](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1122).

#### Mitigating Factors for IIS 5.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1122

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Microsoft Internet Information Services versions 5.1, 6.0, and 7.0 are not affected by this vulnerability.
* **The anonymous user account is denied write access by default**. In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability with write access, the anonymous user account would need to have write access ACLs set within the IIS folder structure. However, by default, the anonymous user account only has read access ACLs set. On IIS 6.0, there is an explicit deny access control entry (ACE) for write permissions for the default anonymous user account. Unless overridden by the administrator, this deny ACE will be inherited by all children under the default Web site root.
* **File system ACLs are enforced**. This vulnerability allows for an attacker to bypass the IIS configuration that specifies which type of authentication is allowed, but not the file system-based ACL check that verifies whether a file is accessible by a given user. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability would still restrict the attacker to the permissions granted to the anonymous user account on the file system ACL level. Therefore this vulnerability cannot be used to exceed the level of access granted to the anonymous user account through file system ACLs. The default anonymous user account is configured as the IUSR\_<computername> account.

#### Workarounds for IIS 5.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1122

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable WebDAV**

  If WebDAV functionality is not required on the server, it can be disabled.

  For IIS 5.0, WebDAV can be disabled as described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 241520](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/241520).

  **Impact of workaround.** After applying this workaround, WebDAV requests will not be served by IIS.
* **Alternate method to disable WebDAV on IIS 5.0**

  The [IIS Lockdown Tool 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=dde9efc0-bb30-47eb-9a61-fd755d23cdec&displaylang;=en) can be used to disable WebDAV as well. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 325864](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/325864).

  + To start the installation immediately, click **Open** or **Run this program from its current location**.
  + To copy the download to your computer for installation at a later time, click **Save** or **Save this program to disk**.

  **Impact of workaround.** This method achieves its results by installing [UrlScan](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/cc242650.aspx). By default, UrlScan blocks requests to WebDAV by detecting either HTTP verbs or headers that would be mapped to WebDAV. If the IIS Lockdown tool is uninstalled, UrlScan will remain. To uninstall UrlScan, unregister the UrlScan ISAPI filter from the IIS Manager snap-in.
* **Change file system ACLs to deny access to the anonymous user accoun**t

  If WebDAV functionality is required, NTFS ACLs should be used to control access to resources on the server. If resources should be inaccessible to the anonymous user through WebDAV, appropriate read or write NTFS ACLs should be applied based on desired access to that resource. For more information on setting ACLs for IIS content, see the following articles:

  + [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 271071](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=271071)
  + [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 812614](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/812614/)

  **Impact of workaround.** Applying this workaround may have adverse effects on products that require content to be accessed by the IUSR\_<computername> account. Examples of these products include System Center Configuration Manager 2007.

#### FAQ for IIS 5.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1122

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability that could allow an attacker to bypass an authentication requirement to access content on an IIS Server.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The WebDAV extension does not properly decode a specially crafted requested URL. This causes WebDAV to apply an incorrect configuration when handling the request. If the applied configuration allows anonymous access, a specially crafted request can bypass authentication. In addition, because WebDAV applies an incorrect configuration, other settings in the IIS configuration that should be applied to a particular path, such as IP address restrictions, may not be honored by WebDAV.

Note that IIS would still process such a request in the security context of the configured anonymous user account. Therefore, this vulnerability cannot be used to bypass NTFS ACLs. The restrictions imposed on the anonymous user account by file system ACLs will still be enforced.

**What is the anonymous user account?**

When Web sites and applications running on the Web server require anonymous access, IIS must be configured with a user account specifically for anonymous access. This account will then be used to access content on the file system when requested by the anonymous Web user. In a default configuration, IIS uses the anonymous user account IUSR\_<computername>, where <computername> is the name of the computer on which IIS is running. However, it is possible to change the anonymous user identity to use a different local user account or a domain user account as the anonymous user account.

**What is WebDAV?**

Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an extension to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that defines how basic file functions such as copy, move, delete and create are performed by a computer using HTTP.

**What is an access control list (ACL)?**

An access control list (ACL) is a list of security protections that applies to an object. (An object can be a file, process, event, or anything else having a security descriptor.) An entry in an ACL is an access control entry (ACE). There are two types of access control list, discretionary and system. Each ACE in an ACL identifies access rights allowed, denied, or audited for that trustee. For information, see the MSDN article, Access Control Lists.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to bypass the IIS configuration that specifies which type of authentication is allowed, but not the file system-based ACL check that verifies whether a file is accessible by a given user. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability would restrict the attacker to the permissions granted to the anonymous user account on file system ACL level. This could allow an attacker to anonymously access information that should only be accessible to an authenticated user, or write files to locations where the anonymous user account is granted write permission.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted HTTP request to a Web site that requires authentication, and thereby gain unauthorized access to protected resources.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Windows 2000 systems on which IIS version 5.0 is used and where WebDAV is enabled are primarily at risk. Typically these are Web servers or application servers, but they may also be developer or Web designer or other workstation systems on which IIS is used with WebDAV. Systems that deviate from the default configuration in that the anonymous user account has been granted write permission are at increased risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the WebDAV extension for IIS handles HTTP requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## IIS 5.1 and 6.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1535

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the WebDAV extension for IIS handles HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted anonymous HTTP request to gain access to a location that typically requires authentication.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-1535](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1535).

* Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 5.0 and 7.0 are not affected by this vulnerability.
* **WebDAV is not enabled by default on IIS 6.0**. On IIS 6.0 running on Windows Server 2003 systems, WebDAV is not enabled in the default configuration. Unless WebDAV has been enabled by an administrator on these systems, the vulnerability is not exposed.
* **The anonymous user account is denied write access by default**. In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability with write access, the anonymous user account would need to have write access ACLs set within the IIS folder structure. However, by default, the anonymous user account only has read access ACLs set. On IIS 6.0, there is an explicit deny ACE for the default anonymous user account.

  2. In the left-hand pane, expand the local computer icon.
  3. Click on **Web Service Extensions** beneath this item.
  4. In the right-hand pane, select **WebDAV** and click the **Prohibit** button.

  **Impact of workaround.** After applying this workaround, WebDAV requests will not be served by IIS.
* **Alternate method to disable WebDAV on IIS 5.1 and IIS 6.0**

  Microsoft UrlScan Filter v3.1 can be used to disable WebDAV as well.

  For IIS 5.1 and IIS 6.0, download Microsoft UrlScan Filter v3.1 from one of the following:

  + For 32-bit systems: [Microsoft Urlscan Filter v3.1 (x86)](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=ee41818f-3363-4e24-9940-321603531989&displaylang;=en)

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

0.1 Personal message

Several news stories seem to allude that Microsoft is artificially downplaying the threat, citations of myself are used to underline the headline in an "us against Microsoft" kind of way. I want to clarify that I have the utmost respect of the MSRC team and I don't suspect Microsoft to willingly downplay anything. They also claim I am from Belgium, I am obviously from Luxembourg. The bug also is not the same as the IIS4/5 one, it's root cause is similar. That's about it.

**About:** The video above shows the different Webdav settings and the different impacts they have. Note that code execution is only possible if these pre-conditions are met. I am not sure how often this kind of setup exists, if I had to guess i'd say not often. Credit: Rangos.

1. Updates

> 25/05/2009 - Update: As Nicolaos wrote in the comment section of this post. IP/Domain filters can be bypassed the same way. In other words if you have a filter for certain IP adresses, you can bypass them.
> Update : Todd Manning over at [Breakpoint labs](http://www.breakingpointsystems.com/community/blog/slash-and-burn-the-iis-6-0-webdav-bug) did comprehensive [tests](http://www.breakingpointsystems.com/community/blog/slash-and-burn-the-iis-6-0-webdav-bug) on which Unicode encodings work. The answer is a lot - IPS/IPS vendors should update their signatures.
> Update : Sharepoint and OWA are not affected by this bug - more info [here](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/05/20/answers-to-the-iis-webdav-authentication-bypass-questions.aspx)
> Update : Skull security has a good write up [here](http://www.skullsecurity.org/blog/?p=285) , they [patched cadaver](http://www.skullsecurity.org/blogdata/cadaver-0.23.2-h4x.patch) to exploit this vulnerability. Nmap script [here](http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-iis-webdav-vuln.html).
> Update: Video detailing the different settings and the different impacts (up to remote code execution) Credit: Rangos
> Update: Nmap IIS6 Webdav scanner added to tools section.
> Update: Webdav Network scanner added to tools section.Update : Microsoft [SRD Team](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/05/18/more-information-about-the-iis-authentication-bypass.aspx) gives more insight and details (Must read)
> Update : Microsoft advisory : <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/971492.mspx>
>
> Update : For IIS 6 : Write access is not allowed per default - as such you can only "upload" content if IUSR\_anonymous is granted write access. This is not the case per default.
>
> Update : IIS5 and IIS7 are NOT affected - IIS5 and 5.1 are affected (according to [MS](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/971492.mspx))
>
> Update : It is unclear how this affects Exchange 2003 (which allows access to inboxes over webdav)

3. Am I at risk ?

Below is a summary by Microsofts SRD Team, please note that the below enumeration leads to think that the chances that your setup is vulnerable is VERY unlikely. IMHO this is not the case, take a standard install of IIS6, enable Webdav, setup a protected folder requiring basic auth. And that's it, you are vulnerable.

You are not at risk if : (Source : Microsoft SRD Team)

* An IIS server not running WebDAV is safe.
  The Windows Server 2003 IIS (version 6) shipped with WebDAV disabled by default.
* An IIS server not using IIS permissions to restrict content to authenticated users is safe.
* An IIS server that does not grant filesystem access to the IUSR\_[MachineName] account is safe.
* An IIS server that hosts web applications using only forms-based authentication is probably safe.

You are at risk : (Source Microsoft SRD Team, except italics by myself)

* **IF** an IIS 5, 5.1, or 6.0 webserver is running with WebDAV enabled (default for IIS5);
* **AND** the IIS server is using IIS permissions to restrict a subfolder of content to authenticated users;
* **AND** file system access is granted for the restricted content to the IUSR\_[MachineName] account;
* **AND** a parent folder of the private subfolder allows anonymous access;
  **THEN** an anonymous remote user may be able to leverage this vulnerability to access files that normally would only be served to authenticated webserver users.

4 Test tools

* Specificaly for this vulnerability: Metasploit added test script to the [trunk](http://trac.metasploit.com/browser/framework3/trunk/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/wmap_dir_webdav_unicode_bypass.rb?rev=6562)
* Webdav network scanner [here](http://www.leetupload.com/dbindex2/index.php?dir=Linux/&file=WebDAVScan.rar)
* [Nmap script](http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-iis-webdav-vuln.html)

IDS/IPS Signatures

* For PROPFIND the "translate:f" option is NOT required (only for GET requests)
* [Breakpoint labs analysed](http://digg.com/u13thO) how the various UTF encodings affected the flaw - lot of variations work.

Recommendation : until the impact is 100% clear you should temporarily disable Webdav or follow the mitigation recommendations from Microsofts SRD team

5. Details

Kingcope a.k.a Nicolaos Rangos released another [pwnie](http://pwnie-awards.org/2008/) grade [vulnerability](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2009/May/att-0134/IIS_Advisory_pdf) yesterday and it's resemblance to the IIS unicode flaw from 2001 was so similar that my jaw first dropped.

Here are a few facts, these are subject to modifications as the news unfolds:

1. Webdav is not enabled by default on IIS6, IIS7 + Webdav is not affected
2. IIS 5 and IIS 5.1 are also affected.
3. Enabling Webdav applies to all websites and doesn't have to be enabled per site.
4. You can actually upload content to the web server, if the IUSR\_anonymous has write access to webdav folders. (To any other folder if the account has write access to other folders)
5. This seems to have a similar (root cause) then the 2001 Unicode IIS4/5 bug , but not exactly the same
6. "Translate:f" is required for GET requests, PROPFIND works without the translate optiion.

Mitigation :

1. Temporary disable Webdav. This is not easy if you have Sharepoint services running. See [here](http://forums.iis.net/t/1149348.aspx)

Backround

In 2001 a path traversal bug was found in IIS4 and IIS5 that lead to a series of serious compromised and massive exploitation (MS01-026). It was bad really bad, the simple path traversal was used to compromise systems remotely mainly through calling (t)ftp.exe to upload arbitrary content.

The path traversal was possible due to Microsoft's introduction of UNICODE support into IIS. The flaw was by design, a typical logical fallacy. Unicode conversion was added AFTER the security checks and not before, resulting in the path "..%c0%af.." to be considered a VALID path, yet it is nothing else then "../.." in ascii. More details can be found [here](http://www.sans.org/reading_room/whitepapers/threats/unicode_vulnerability_how_why_458).

**MS01-26** - 2001

Here is the logic flaw that lead to the vulnerability in 2001. I quickly drafted this in Visio, below is the way it was supposed to work:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjG2QOWX5UvLqYzii-Ao-my6h0tS1V4-ZWR9I-2hkgMtbCLeZkYqkfUHumsCU-Yjmnvy7WVq3c2kQ5_D7pc60TX4ApLKghhDUgkjfutPE5bQ2wgmcYILPbUjR6hdRCUO8XLyd6YdRqS_iQ/s400/iis4_5.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjG2QOWX5UvLqYzii-Ao-my6h0tS1V4-ZWR9I-2hkgMtbCLeZkYqkfUHumsCU-Yjmnvy7WVq3c2kQ5_D7pc60TX4ApLKghhDUgkjfutPE5bQ2wgmcYILPbUjR6hdRCUO8XLyd6YdRqS_iQ/s1600-h/iis4_5.png)
*Figure1 IIS4/5 how the security check was supposed to work* (**click to enlarge**)

Here is how it was implemented :

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFAs5a2BqIvRXOmmyLHTIlALZ9Z6kHIycq8GPzCP_JAGxWveFcbcG6LLRO3CJoKW9M4Wg7mmRyKNOyKjjDV_DemKb7yeOWtGc9k4mLYIYfCpO4UOLLMibkwVTA-ynz46tFFPvll_vmD8M/s400/iis4_5_implemented.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFAs5a2BqIvRXOmmyLHTIlALZ9Z6kHIycq8GPzCP_JAGxWveFcbcG6LLRO3CJoKW9M4Wg7mmRyKNOyKjjDV_DemKb7yeOWtGc9k4mLYIYfCpO4UOLLMibkwVTA-ynz46tFFPvll_vmD8M/s1600-h/iis4_5_implemented.png)

*Figure 2 - IIS4/5 how the security check was implemented* (**click to enlarge**)

In other words Microsoft, certainly through the late addition of Unicode support to IIS, failed to realize that converting chars to Unicode representation should happen before any "security" checks. So the flaw was one of logic, Unicode conversion after the security check.

Fast forward 2009 - Kingcope releases a similar vulnerability.

MS09-971492 - 2009

The bug discovered by Rangos seems to suffer from a similar logic mistake when requesting source (translate:f) that has been introduced in the Webdav component. It appears that unicode characters are removed **after** the security checks.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIsOy8V_1vY4ROVxWU3IWgTmtdZ4oexrvhRgGzVU8gQeTvZqLEh8-BLPe4qL95wnLHczQQLMBfNS9XKk_go_Zv5u8sbXvmrjxpJMIlNy2WpJhGaj8dokUiOSFIhZUaNx07B31Uoztfhpo/s400/iis6_webdav.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIsOy8V_1vY4ROVxWU3IWgTmtdZ4oexrvhRgGzVU8gQeTvZqLEh8-BLPe4qL95wnLHczQQLMBfNS9XKk_go_Zv5u8sbXvmrjxpJMIlNy2WpJhGaj8dokUiOSFIhZUaNx07B31Uoztfhpo/s1600-h/iis6_webdav.png)
*Figure 3 - IIS6 Webdav component Unicode replacement* (**click to enlarge**)

Details

Example: Uploading arbritary content to an asp page - Creating ASP files only works if "Script Source Access" is enabled and IUSR\_Anonymous has write access to the folder. Creating INC files works even if with "script source access disabled". (Source : Hubert.Seiwert)
> PUT /protected%c0%af/hello.asp HTTP/1.1
>
> Host: 192.168.171.142
>
> Translate: f
>
> Content-Length: 27
>
> <%response.write("hello")%>

The server will however not execute this asp page - currently no code execution is known to be possible, even if write access is enabled (see exception below). The reason is that you can't simply issue a GET request to the asp page you just created - it's password protected and execution over webdav fails.

However code execution would be possible in scenarios where :

1. IUSR\_Anonymous has write access to the folder in question
2. If you map the root (or any other) WWW folder to the webdav folder (an hence can issue a simply GET request to the uploaded file)
