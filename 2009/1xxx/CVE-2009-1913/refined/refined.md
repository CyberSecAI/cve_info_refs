Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-1913

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the authentication mechanism of Luxbum 0.5.5/stable. This occurs when the application uses Dotclear's authentication system but fails to properly sanitize user inputs passed to SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization when using Dotclear authentication. Specifically, the username field in the login form is vulnerable.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain administrative access without knowing valid credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized administrative access to the Luxbum web gallery.
- **Potential Compromise:** Once authenticated, the attacker can perform administrative tasks, which can potentially lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the login form accessible through the web interface of the Luxbum application (manager.php).
- **SQL Injection:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the username field of the login form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server running the vulnerable Luxbum application.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection:**  The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques and the ability to craft malicious SQL queries.
- **Specific Configuration:** The attacker needs to target an installation of Luxbum that uses Dotclear authentication (not the default authentication method) and has `magic_quotes` disabled.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit leverages the fact that Luxbum accesses user information from the Dotclear database, specifically the `user_super` column, to determine admin status. The SQL injection allows the attacker to manipulate the SQL query to always return at least one row with `user_super = 1`, which grants administrative privileges to the attacker when the application proceeds with the authorization.

The exploit string is:
`' OR user_super=1 #` as the username and any password
This payload bypasses the username/password check by creating a condition that is always true, and then the authentication check passes the user as an admin because at least one row with `user_super=1` exists.

The provided exploit code in perl:
1. Sends POST request to the `/manager.php?p=login` with the payload `username='+OR+user_super%3D1%23&password=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.
2. Checks if the response contains `message_ko` to know if authentication failed or not.
3. If authentication bypass was successful, then checks if the current user is admin by checking if the response contains `h1_admin`.

This detailed analysis provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, how it can be exploited, and the potential impact.
