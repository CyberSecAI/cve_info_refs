    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper certificate validation",
      "Bypassed revocation checks"

        "Malicious website with a revoked EV certificate"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control a website and use a revoked EV certificate.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because Safari fails to properly check the revocation status of Extended Validation (EV) certificates. By bypassing this check, a user visiting a malicious website using a revoked EV certificate would not receive a warning, potentially allowing for man-in-the-middle or phishing attacks to occur without alerting the user to the risks."
