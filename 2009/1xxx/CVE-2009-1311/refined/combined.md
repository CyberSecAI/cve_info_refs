    to Javascript URIs, resulting in cross-site scripting.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.9.0.9-0lenny2.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-21

## POST data sent to wrong site when saving web page with embedded frame

Announced
April 21, 2009
Reporter
Paolo Amadini
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.9
* SeaMonkey 1.1.17

### Description

Developer and Mozilla community member **Paolo
Amadini** reported that when saving the inner frame of a web
page as a file when the outer page has POST data associated with it,
the POST data will be incorrectly sent to the URL of the inner frame.
This could potentially result in a user's sensitive data being sent to
a site for which it was not intended.

- java-1\_4\_2-ibm/IBMJava2
This update brings IBM Java 1.4.2 to Service Release 13.
It fixes lots of bugs and following security issues:
CVE-2008-3104: Security vulnerabilities in the Java
Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet that is
loaded from a remote system to circumvent network access
restrictions and establish socket connections to certain
services running on the local host, as if it were loaded
from the system that the applet is running on. This may
allow the untrusted remote applet the ability to exploit
any security vulnerabilities existing in the services it
has connected to.
CVE-2008-3112: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create arbitrary files with the
permissions of the user running the untrusted Java Web
Start application.
CVE-2008-3113: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application downloaded
from a website to create or delete arbitrary files with
the permissions of the user running the untrusted Java
Web Start application.
CVE-2008-3114: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to
determine the location of the Java Web Start cache.
CVE-2008-5350: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted applet or
application to list the contents of the home directory of
the user running the applet or application.
CVE-2008-5346: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with parsing zip files may allow an
untrusted applet or application to read arbitrary memory
locations in the process that the applet or application is
running in.
CVE-2008-5343: A vulnerability in Java Web Start and Java
Plug-in may allow hidden code on a host to make network
connections to that host and to hijack HTTP sessions using
cookies stored in the browser.
CVE-2008-5344: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with applet classloading may allow an
untrusted applet to read arbitrary files on a system that
the applet runs on and make network connections to hosts
other than the host it was loaded from.
CVE-2008-5359: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) image processing code may allow
an untrusted applet or application to escalate privileges.
For example, an untrusted applet may grant itself
permissions to read and write local files or execute local
applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5339: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java Web Start
application to make network connections to hosts other than
the host that the application is downloaded from.
CVE-2008-5340: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with launching Java Web Start applications may
allow an untrusted Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted application may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted application.
CVE-2008-5348: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with authenticating users through
Kerberos may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) to the
system as a whole, due to excessive consumption of
operating system resources.
CVE-2008-2086: A vulnerability in Java Web Start may allow
certain trusted operations to be performed, such as
modifying system properties.
CVE-2008-5345: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) allows
code loaded from the local filesystem to access localhost.
This may allow code that is maliciously placed on the local
filesystem and then subsequently run, to have network
access to localhost that would not otherwise be allowed if
the code were loaded from a remote host. This may be
leveraged to steal cookies and hijack sessions (for domains
that map a name to the localhost).
CVE-2008-5351: The UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format-8)
decoder in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) accepts
encodings that are longer than the "shortest" form. This
behavior is not a vulnerability in Java SE. However, it may
be leveraged to exploit systems running software that
relies on the JRE UTF-8 decoder to reject non-shortest form
sequences. For example, non-shortest form sequences may be
decoded into illegal URIs, which may then allow files that
are not otherwise accessible to be read, if the URIs are
not checked following UTF-8 decoding.
CVE-2008-5360: The Java Runtime Environment creates
temporary files with insufficiently random names. This may
be leveraged to write JAR files which may then be loaded as
untrusted applets and Java Web Start applications to access
and provide services from localhost and hence steal cookies.
CVE-2008-5353: A security vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) related to deserializing calendar objects
may allow an untrusted applet or application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5356: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5354: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) may allow an untrusted Java
application that is launched through the command line to
escalate privileges. For example, the untrusted Java
application may grant itself permissions to read and write
local files or execute local applications that are
accessible to the user running the untrusted Java
application.
This vulnerability cannot be exploited by an applet or
Java Web Start application.
CVE-2008-5357: A buffer vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with processing fonts may allow an
untrusted applet or Java Web Start application to escalate
privileges. For example, an untrusted applet may grant
itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running
the untrusted applet.
CVE-2008-5342: A security vulnerability in the the Java Web
Start BasicService allows untrusted applications that are
downloaded from another system to request local files to be

This update of openssl fixes the following problems:
- CVE-2009-0590: ASN1\_STRING\_print\_ex() function allows remote denial
of service
- CVE-2009-0591: CMS\_verify() function allows signatures to look valid
- CVE-2009-0789: denial of service due to malformed ASN.1 structures
Affected products: SLES 9, SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- libsoup
Large strings could lead to a heap overflow in the base64 encoding and
decoding functions. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0585).
Affected products: Novell Linux Desktop 9, POS 9, OES, SLES 9, SLE 10
- opensc/libopensc2
Private data objects on smartcards initialized with OpenSC could be
accessed without authentication (CVE-2009-0368).
Only blank cards initialized with OpenSC are affected by this
problem. Affected cards need to be manually fixed, updating the
opensc package alone is not sufficient!
Please carefully read and follow the instructions on the following
web site if you are using PIN protected private data objects on
smart cards other than Oberthur, and you have initialized those
cards using OpenSC:
<http://en.opensuse.org/Smart_Cards/Advisories>
Affected products: SLE 10, SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- python-crypto
Missing checks for the key length in the ARC2 module potentially allowed
attackers to crash applications using python-crypto or potentially even
cause execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0544).
Affected products: SLE 11, openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- unbound
This update fixes a heap-based buffer overflow in the
ldns\_rr\_new\_frm\_str\_internal()
function. This allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
DNS resource record (RR) with a long class field and possibly TTL field.
(CVE-2009-1086)
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- xpdf
Specially crafted PDF files could lead to crashes, make the viewer
run into an infinite loop or potentially even allow execution of
arbitrary code.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0437)

## Topic

Updated seamonkey packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, and 4.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

SeaMonkey is an open source Web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running SeaMonkey.
(CVE-2009-1303, CVE-2009-1305)

Several flaws were found in the way malformed web content was processed. A
web page containing malicious content could execute arbitrary JavaScript in
the context of the site, possibly presenting misleading data to a user, or
stealing sensitive information such as login credentials. (CVE-2009-0652,
CVE-2009-1306, CVE-2009-1307, CVE-2009-1309, CVE-2009-1312)

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey saved certain web pages to a local
file. If a user saved the inner frame of a web page containing POST data,
the POST data could be revealed to the inner frame, possibly surrendering
sensitive information such as login credentials. (CVE-2009-1311)

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues. After installing the update, SeaMonkey must be restarted for
the changes to take effect.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=496274#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-04-17 15:34:22 UTC  ``` Mozilla community member Michael reported that when a server responds with a Refresh header containing a javascript: URI, Firefox will redirect to the javascript: URI. If an attacker could inject a Refresh header into a server response, or could control the value that a site places in the Refresh header, they could use this vulnerability to perform an XSS attack and execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of that site.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=496274#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-21 23:59:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1  Via RHSA-2009:0437 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0437.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=496274#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-04-22 01:43:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:0436 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0436.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=496274#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-04-22 20:25:32 UTC  ``` xulrunner-1.9.0.9-1.fc9, firefox-3.0.9-1.fc9, epiphany-extensions-2.22.1-10.fc9, epiphany-2.22.2-10.fc9, blam-1.8.5-8.fc9.1, chmsee-1.0.1-11.fc9, devhelp-0.19.1-11.fc9, evolution-rss-0.1.0-10.fc9, galeon-2.0.7-9.fc9, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-26.fc9, gnome-web-photo-0.3-20.fc9, google-gadgets-0.10.5-5.fc9, gtkmozembedmm-1.4.2.cvs20060817-28.fc9, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc9.1, Miro-2.0.3-3.fc9, mozvoikko-0.9.5-9.fc9, mugshot-1.2.2-8.fc9, ruby-gnome2-0.17.0-8.fc9, totem-2.23.2-14.fc9, yelp-2.22.1-11.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
When saving an inner frame as file only (not as a complete web page), the POST data of the outer page is incorrectly sent to the address of the inner frame.
I've not tested the case explicitly, but in "toolkit/conten/contentAreaUtils.js"
it seems that the POST data is attached even if the page displayed in the frame
is from a different domain. This could cause the POST data to be available to
the inner site even if not originally intended by the author of the outer page.
Because of this concern I've marked this bug with the security flag, even if
this kind of data leak is quite unlikely in a real situation.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
I tested this with the POW extension and the attached files.
1. Install POW (<http://davidkellogg.com/wiki/Main_Page>)
2. Copy the attached files to web server's root directory
3. Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:6670/test-post.sjs>
4. Type "Outer" in the upper textbox and click "Submit Query" nearby.
5. Type "Inner" in the lower textbox and click "Submit Query" nearby.
6. Right click inside the inner frame, select "This Frame", "Save Frame As...".
7. Select "Web Page, HTML only" and save the page.
8. Open the saved page.
Actual Results:
You will see "Inner input: Outer".
Expected Results:
You should have seen "Inner input: Inner".

I can verify this problem is present using the files in [attachment 355327](/attachment.cgi?id=355327 "Unzip files into $OBJDIR/_tests/testing/mochitest, load http://localhost:8888/test-post.sjs and follow STR to verify") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=355327&action=edit "Unzip files into $OBJDIR/_tests/testing/mochitest, load http://localhost:8888/test-post.sjs and follow STR to verify") (with the slight difference that the displayed input for each frame is "inputdata=Outer" or "inputdata=Inner", due to my being lazy in converting the provided attachments to httpd.js format).
Given that you have explicit user interaction inside an iframe inside a page which is the result of a form submit including sensitive data, I think this is probably sg:low.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: trueWhiteboard: [sg:low]

I don't really have time to test this or drive it in at the moment, but I think this would likely fix it.

I tested the change on Firefox 3.0.5 on Windows using an overlay, and it solves
the problem I reported in that the POST data of the inner frame is not resent
at all (the sessionHistory variable in getPostData appears to be null).
Passing aDocument to getPostData is correct in any case, and has the side effect
of allowing saveInternal to be called on a page different from the one displayed
in the current tab, which is never done in the browser - but now I can do it
safely in the Mozilla Archive Format extension I'm currently maintaining,
thank you :-)
I also tested the case where the outer page is saved, and the page in the
current tab is changed while the save file picker is displayed (since the save
dialog is modal, this can only be done from another window, like "Library").
In this case no POST data is sent, since the newly displayed page has no POST
data associated with it, and no potential data leak occurs.
Said that, I think this patch allows this bug to be closed.
If this helps, since I'm already working on this portion of the code (see bug
471875), I may be interested in providing a more complete solution over time,
allowing the right POST data to be resent or the cached version of the page to
be saved. I'm not sure this is possible on the current code, however the
information in [bug 84106 comment 19](/show_bug.cgi?id=84106#c19 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Not correctly retrieving post data when saving a page or frame generated from a form POST") seems to hint in that direction. I'd only
need some help with validating and testing my patches, since I currently test
them outside of the normal build process.

Is that not the case with this patch?

What I mean is that, if you follow the steps to reproduce above, the current
patch causes the saved page to contain "Inner input: undefined". That's fine
for resolving the current bug, however what I'd have expected would be to
see "Inner input: Inner", either because the request containing the POST
data was repeated or because the page was fetched from the cache.
> Any work you'd be willing to do in this area would be more than welcome!
Thank you! I have some questions open in [bug 471875](/show_bug.cgi?id=471875 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactoring: in contentAreaUtils.js, create a new internalPersist function"), maybe you can have a
look at them when you find some time. It seems someone also requested a
review from you for the patch I attached there.
I'll proceed from there, however consider that I'll not always be able to
respond in a timely manner, since I'm working on this in my spare time.
Thank you again!

I did some research and found this:
[nsDocShell::AddChildSHEntry]
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/docshell/base/nsDocShell.cpp#2713>
It seems that, for each tab, only one session history object is actually present, and is associated with the root docshell. This session history
object contains a list of session history entries. Each entry can be the root
of a tree of other entries, whose structure probably resembles that of the
root document.
When a new document is loaded in a child frame, a new root history entry is
created. The new entry is a deep copy of the previous one, with a difference
only for the child element associated with the modified frame.
I think this is why the sessionHistory variable in getPostData is null when
the document was loaded in a child docshell.

What needs to be done to get Gavin's patch committed? May I help?
If a proper test case needs to be written, what do you think is the
most appropriate testing framework? Writing an automated "browser" test
would be tricky, since at present we have no way of knowing when the
asynchronous internalSave call completes (unless we monitor the presence
and accessibility of the output file). Maybe a manual test procedure like
the one already available is enough for now?

Doesn't the save end up going through the download manager? If so, you can listen for completion from the download manager...

I still have to study this part, however yes, I think so, assuming that the
download is the only one that is started. Or, maybe, by narrowing the search
using download properties like the source URL and target file.
Besides, what I actually did in the latest Mozilla Archive Format extension
was to overlay internalSave and modify it to allow chaining another download
listener exactly for the save being started. In that case there was also the
option not to show the save process in the download manager at all.
Do you think writing a browser test case in the former way, rather than a
preliminary manual test, at this stage is necessary and worth the effort
anyway? Consider that I'll probably work more thoroughly on this area of the
code in the next few months (only [bug 471875](/show_bug.cgi?id=471875 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactoring: in contentAreaUtils.js, create a new internalPersist function") is blocking me right now), and
at that point we might have a more powerful internalSave anyway.
If the answer is yes, are there other tests that do a similar job that you
know of, to start from?

An automated test is always better. Machine time is cheap, and human time isn't. Also, automated tests can run after just about every check-in, and cause a patch to get backed out when they fail, so it prevents regressions.
There are a slew of automated chrome tests here that do much of what you need to already do:

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=359923&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=471962&attachment=359923)

I attached a skeleton chrome test case that loads the test page in a
browser and submits the two forms. The frame save operation and the
actual test for POST data is still missing.
I sent my work in advance in order to have some feedback as to whether
this is the correct approach, so that I may fix possible problems early.

Thanks for reviewing. Now I have a little problem: I can't figure out how to
access the global functions defined in the chrome window of the "browser"
element I have in my external test window. I need that, I think, to call the
internalSave function defined in contentAreaUtils.js and start the automatic
save operation on the inner frame while specifying the save file name.
All the solutions I found use overlays or are browser chrome tests, but maybe
you know a simple way to do it from a normal chrome test using a few lines of
code!

I copied some infrastructure from toolkit/components/downloads/test/browser,
and turned the chrome test into a browser chrome test. Now I reached what
seems to be a dead end: I cannot call internalSave and specify the file name
that will be used to save the document (parameter aChosenData) while at the
same time specifying to save the page as HTML only (saveAsType different from
kSaveAsType\_Complete). If I don't specify aChosenData, the native file picker
dialog is shown, and I think that the user choices in that widget cannot be
automated reliably.
Do you think it is ok to modify internalSave specifically to allow this
automated test to be executed? If so, since there could be different
approaches to achieve the same result, can you tell me how you would do it?

What you'll probably have to do is register your own mock implementation of nsIFilePicker. I don't think there are any samples of this, but there are some samples of how to do it with nsIPromptService:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/mozapps/downloads/tests/chrome/test_bug_412360.xul#69>
Note - you'll want to unregister your factor after you are done testing.

Properly filling in the license boilerplate is harder than it seems :-) I
omitted the boilerplate from some files on the basis that many other test
cases I saw didn't include an explicit license block to begin with, however
I agree that for new files it is far better to include it. This opens up
another round of observations:
\* The only file in my patch that included the boilerplate is a modification
of mine of "toolkit/components/downloads/test/browser/Makefile.in". Shawn
Wilsher is listed as a contributor in that file. I didn't remove his name,
however I agree with him that his name should be removed on the basis that
the makefile was probably a copy of another one, and I probably removed
all his original contributions as part of further modifying the file.
\* Since I am not the original developer of the two makefiles I included in
my patch, probably my name shouldn't appear in place of the original
developer. I also believe that I can choose not to list my name as a
contributor in the makefiles, since in this case I consider my
modifications to be trivial enough and to be the unavoidable consequence
of the addition of other files (that will include my name) in other
portions of the source tree nearby. That is consistent with many other
makefiles I saw, that don't include the name of any contributor even if
they have plenty of revisions by different people in the source control
log files.
\* The main browser chrome test file is obviously my original work.
\* The test pages were created by me with no explicit license, then modified
by Jeff Walden still with no explicit license, then modified again by me.
I guess I am the original developer and Jeff Walden shoud be listed as a
contributor.
As for the actual contributor name line in the boilerplate, I guess the
bugmail address is the generally accepted form of identity in the Mozilla
project. In my own source files, I usually place my homepage URL (that might
also become an OpenID in the future) beside my name. I guess the latter way
of identifying me here is precluded at present, right?
Oh, and I'll fix the whitespace, of course :-)

There are no formal rules on what is acceptable, but it's probably best to avoid using more than one line, and the goal of the notice was originally to ensure that you can be contacted should there be a desire to relicense the file at some point in the future, so using an email address would probably be best.
The rest of your points seem fine, though I wouldn't worry too much about the license boilerplate in general. I think it's probably fine to just omit them as in the current patch.

So I've applied that test patch and noticed a couple of things:
-it doesn't seem to fail on a current trunk build, even without my patch. Is that expected? Was it actually fixed by [bug 480318](/show_bug.cgi?id=480318 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]\"Save Page As\" doesn't give the filename of the bugzilla attachment")?
-it causes the download manager UI to appear, and stay open. Tests should generally clean up after themselves to avoid interfering with other tests. The easiest way to fix that is probably to set the browser.download.manager.showWhenStarting pref to false during the test and then reset it, I suppose.
Otherwise it looks fine. Need to sort out the first issue, though.

On trunk, [bug 84106](/show_bug.cgi?id=84106 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Not correctly retrieving post data when saving a page or frame generated from a form POST") being fixed means that if the page is cached we'll just read it from cache and not resend any kind of POST data at all. Can we change the test to return a "Cache-Control: no-store" header? That should help with that little issue, I think...
I'm a little confused by this bug (and patch) in general, though. When doing a save as "HTML only", isDocument is false:
var isDocument = aDocument != null && saveMode != SAVEMODE\_FILEONLY;
So right now we're always passing in null for the postdata, I would think (which saves us from the full effects of [bug 479296](/show_bug.cgi?id=479296 "NEW - Saving POST result page silently resends POST data if page no longer in cache")). See [bug 300032 comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=300032#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - Text Web page generated by POST is retried as GET when Save As or Send Page used"). That also has some comments relevant to this bug.
Given the above, I admit to being a little confused about how people are seeing the wrong post data submitted. That, and very worried, since I'm clearly missing something in the code flow here. Any ideas what?

Oh, I see what I'm missing. The saveMode at this point is based on the content-type only, not on what the user selects. So for HTML it won't be FILEONLY. Given that, we do want to keep [bug 300032](/show_bug.cgi?id=300032 "RESOLVED FIXED - Text Web page generated by POST is retried as GET when Save As or Send Page used") separate, and fix it separately, I think.

Attached patch

[Browser chrome test case, using internalSave directly](attachment.cgi?id=366856&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=366856&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=471962&attachment=366856)

The attached patch should work again with trunk. The problem was indeed caused
by the fact that the fix for [bug 84106](/show_bug.cgi?id=84106 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Not correctly retrieving post data when saving a page or frame generated from a form POST") caused the page to be retrieved from the
history cache. I solved the problem by bypassing saveDocument and calling
internalSave directly. I also tried using the "Cache-Control: no-store"
header, but it didn't work, and that is expected as for RFC 2616:
<http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9.2>
"Even when this directive is associated with a response, users might
explicitly store such a response outside of the caching system (e.g.,
with a "Save As" dialog). History buffers MAY store such responses as
part of their normal operation."
The license boilerplate text is now fixed, have a look at what I mean with
using the website address. If the goal is to be able to contact me easily
after two years or so, it's probably better than the bugmail, which is more
subject to change.
I also bypassed the download manager UI completely, using the same mock object
trick that is present for the file picker. It's safer and faster, I think.

Hmm. Yeah, indeed; no-store would not affect an ONLY\_FROM\_CACHE load.
I'd really rather gavin reviewed this; he's much more familiar with the download manager stuff than I am.

Exactly, saveMode is a bitmask while saveAsType is an integer that can be set
to one of the kSaveAsType\_\* constants and depends on the user's choice. The
save code is not really easy to read and understand, and depends heavily on
assumptions on the supplied parameters, and that's what [bug 471875](/show_bug.cgi?id=471875 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactoring: in contentAreaUtils.js, create a new internalPersist function") is all
about.

The test still seems to leave the test page loaded after the test completes. You should probably close that tab and add a new blank one after the test is complete (or just start the load in a new tab to begin with, then close it).
Replacing the transfer implementation seems a bit more fragile than just setting the relevant pref (to avoid the showing) and using a normal download manager listener (to detect the download finishing), as in <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/downloads/test/unit/test_bug_420230.js#91> .
Otherwise this looks good. Want to fix those two issues and repost the patch?

Done: I went for the first alternative.

I'm not sure about the merits of ether alternative, however I reverted the
code to the original implementation that used the download listener. In
addition to setting the preference to avoid opening the UI, I had to set
another one to avoid the Download Manager retaining the download in the list.
The only thing that I noticed the test leaves behind now is the default save
directory, that becomes the current user's temporary directory. I don't think
this can cause problems to any other test, however.
Another important fix is that the original XPCOM factory for the file picker
needs to be restored manually. Probably also this test should be fixed:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/mozapps/downloads/tests/chrome/test_bug_412360.xul>
At present I haven't time to run the entire browser test suite to cross-check
if the patch now plays well with other tests; you'd do me a favor if you can
do the final test, thanks.

These can avoid having to record the previous value by just using clearUserPref and assuming the default value (a fair assumption for unit test profiles, I would hope).

Hmm, this relies on the DOMContentLoaded for the container frame firing first, which I suppose is probably safe, but I'm a bit leery any time we rely on event ordering this way in tests (it's often caused "intermittent" problems on the slower and overburdened automated test VMs). We'll just have to keep an eye out for sporadic failures when it lands, I guess.

Add an ok(innerFrame) check, for better diagnostics should this fail for whatever reason? In fact, this could apply to a few of the other getElementById calls as well.
Looks good otherwise, I will r+ with those changes. Sorry for making you go through so many review iterations!

You can't rely on that. Can this code look for load events and check the target, perhaps?

This is ok as a first cut to close up the security hole, but the only reason it fixes this bug is that sessionHistory for the subframe ends up null so we return null from getPostData.
Please file a followup bug on actually getting the right postdata for the given document?

Yes, that's probably better, to avoid the test succeeding because for example
a truncated file was generated.

Actually it doesn't. It relies, however, on the fact that the DOMContentLoaded
event is fired two times, one for the outer document and one for the iframe.
Do you think this can be a fair assumption? If so, I'll just update the
comments to make this clear. The alternative would be to rewrite the event
handling code in a completely different way, because to explicitly check
the targets the safest way is probably to register the event listeners once,
and then keep track of the expected load state as the events are fired.

Calling the "ok" function, even without a message, would cause a line to
appear in the test output log, and the count of total and passed tests to
be incremented. Since the point of this test case is not to verify that the
DOM elements are loaded correctly, neither to meta-test that the test itself
is written correctly, probably it's better to let an exception occur if
something goes wrong. I could also wrap an ok(false, "message") in an if
block that checks for null pointers, but probably the message would say
exactly what reading the line causing the exception would have said in
any case.

No problem for this! I appreciate that all of you take the time to check my
code thoroughly; it's an opportunity to learn Mozilla programming, and the
next piece of code I'll write will be of better quality.
I'll be able to provide an updated patch tomorrow.

I rewrote the code a little to make it explicit that I check that
DOMContentLoaded is fired two times. If you have a better idea, please
be a little more specific, as this would save me a lot of time figuring
out what the exact document / window / browser / frame / load / pageshow /
DOMContentLoaded / bubbling / capturing / target / originalTarget
interactions are, and which of them can be relied upon :-)

potential patch
The test doesn't work on the 1.9.0 branch because [bug 462864](/show_bug.cgi?id=462864 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expose request body as a stream, state-machine refactoring") (test harness http server feature) hasn't landed there.
I've run it manually using a newer test harness, though, and verified that it fails without the patch and passes with it.

I agree, and the more now that the problem is fixed. As I said in [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=471962#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - When saving an inner frame as file only, the POST data of the outer page is sent to the address of the inner page"),
in any case, the data leak caused by this bug is quite unlikely in a real
situation, since it's the POST data of the outer frame that is sent to the
inner frame and not the other way around.

I'll say skip the second bug, I'll just port it into my work with: [Bug 381157](/show_bug.cgi?id=381157 "VERIFIED FIXED - Make SeaMonkey download manager use toolkit backend"). I agree though that contentAreaUtils.js still being forked is painful though.

Actually, Serge and I were thinking that, to make things simple, Gavin's
five-liner patch could be applied to the other file and attached to bug
483959, beside the fix for the test case.
There's nothing wrong in including the fix also in [bug 381157](/show_bug.cgi?id=381157 "VERIFIED FIXED - Make SeaMonkey download manager use toolkit backend"), but I suppose
the change would then be difficult to backport to the release branches?
On the long term, maybe there's a way to share contentAreaUtils.js code again?

The right patch for the other bug is the ifdef, as discussed. I'll fix this issue in my DLMGR port. No need to bitrot the large file for such a trivial issue (that will be fixed by the next BETA of seamonkey). If serge however wants to draft a patch for SM-stable, I'll be glad to accept it (or I can create one later), note SeaMonkey stable is on 1.8.1.

This is ok for me. It seems that Gavin's patch would apply cleanly to
SeaMonkey stable, if I looked at the right branch in MXR :-)
The fix for the test on [bug 483959](/show_bug.cgi?id=483959 "VERIFIED FIXED - [SeaMonkey] Browser-Chrome browser_bug471962.js times out on SeaMonkey") is also ready to be committed on trunk,
however it's likely that the test can't be backported to SeaMonkey stable,
as [comment #55](/show_bug.cgi?id=471962#c55 "RESOLVED FIXED - When saving an inner frame as file only, the POST data of the outer page is sent to the address of the inner page") suggests.
Thus, if we're interested in fixing the issue in SM-stable, we may just
attach a small patch to the other existing bug, or file a dedicated bug.
I don't have a comm-central checkout however, so I cannot do this at present.

As said, SeaMonkey stable is 1.8.1 (comm-central is SeaMonkey trunk though it's using Mozilla 1.9.1 right now, we left out 1.9.0 and will only start having dev versions with 1.9.2 once we branch comm-central) and we have no support for running tests on stable/1.8.1, i.e. the contentAreaUtils.js fix is enough there.

Is there any way to get this automated test checked into 1.9.0? I don't see a manual way to test this. The original case in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=471962#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - When saving an inner frame as file only, the POST data of the outer page is sent to the address of the inner page") gives the proper behavior when run in 1.9.0.7.

That requires [bug 483854](/show_bug.cgi?id=483854 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - backport trunk https.js to 1.9.0 branch?") to be fixed; doable, dunno how much work it'd be. It probably isn't that much effort, but I'm not sure, and I don't have time to try to do it.

I did one more round of tests, and since this bug and [bug 84106](/show_bug.cgi?id=84106 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Not correctly retrieving post data when saving a page or frame generated from a form POST") were fixed
the only remaining problem, for subframes, is that sometimes pages generated
by POST may be retried as GET when saved locally. This now happens only when
the page is not in the cache anymore. This is now filed as [bug 485196](/show_bug.cgi?id=485196 "RESOLVED FIXED - Web page generated by POST is retried as GET when Save Frame As used, and the page is no longer in the cache").
The situation is worse if the saved page is the top-level document, but that
is already filed as [bug 479296](/show_bug.cgi?id=479296 "NEW - Saving POST result page silently resends POST data if page no longer in cache").

When I clear the cache, 1.9.0.8 (pre-patch) reproduces the bug (the saved page says "Inner input: Outer").
When I run it in the current nightly (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.9pre) Gecko/2009040204 GranParadiso/3.0.9pre), I get "Inner input: undefined" on the saved page (following the instructions and clearing the cache after I initially load the test page).
This doesn't look fixed in 1.9.0.9.

The bug is fixed if the POST data for the outer page is not sent to the inner page's URI. With a cleared cache you're not sending the inner frame's data, because of [bug 485196](/show_bug.cgi?id=485196 "RESOLVED FIXED - Web page generated by POST is retried as GET when Save Frame As used, and the page is no longer in the cache"). But sounds like \_this\_ bug is fixed.

Yes, then that is correct. Marking it as verified then. The inner frame is definitely not getting the POST data.Keywords: [fixed1.9.0.9](/buglist.cgi?keywords=fixed1.9.0.9&resolution=---) → [verified1.9.0.9](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verified1.9.0.9&resolution=---)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
