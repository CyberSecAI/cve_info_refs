After an [evaluation](https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/DevelopmentInfrastructure), GNOME has moved from Bugzilla to [GitLab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/). [Learn more about GitLab](https://wiki.gnome.org/GitLab).
**No new issues can be reported in GNOME Bugzilla anymore.**

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=577270#c0)  Anthony de Almeida Lopes    2009-03-30 08:10:54 UTC  ``` There seems to be cross-site scripting in the DAAP extension for Banshee. This is at least in the URL for GET.   GET /apps/web/vs_diag.cgi?server=<script>GEsEDLP8</script> HTTP/1.0  HTTP/1.1 400 BadRequest Content-Length: 352 Content-Type: text/html Connection: close  <html><head><title>Invalid Request - Banshee DAAP Browser</title></head><body><h1>Invalid Request</h1><p>The request 'apps/web/vs_diag.cgi?server=<script>GEsEDLP8</script>' could not be processed by server.</p><hr /><address>Generated on 3/30/2009 10:02:02 AM by Banshee DAAP Plugin (<a href="<http://banshee-project.org>"><http://banshee-project.org></a>)Connection closed by foreign host. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=577270#c1)  Anthony de Almeida Lopes    2009-03-30 08:24:29 UTC  ``` I've reported this to the RedHat and Novell/SuSE security teams as a security vulnerability. I have not filed a CVE as some developers take issues with that happening too early, but if I do not hear otherwise by the end of the week, I will be reserving a candidate with MITRE. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=577270#c2)  Gabriel Burt    2009-03-30 14:29:41 UTC  ``` Thanks for the report, Anthony.  That input should indeed be escaped.  Correct me if you think I'm wrong, but I believe that in practice the number of users this will make vulnerable is close to zero: only those who use their web browser to view Banshee's DAAP proxy - an unadvertised feature.  Normally it is used only by Banshee/GStreamer, which I don't believe are vulnerable to the XSS by virtue of ignoring it.  Your thoughts? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=577270#c3)  Anthony de Almeida Lopes    2009-03-30 14:53:51 UTC  ``` Yeah, I agree that the number of users that could be affected is very very low.  There is a situation where it is "exploitable" though. You can send a user to  <http://localhost:8089/><xss-here/>. Technically, that's "exploiting". However, that requires the attacker to guess who is using the DAAP extension, which is a bit absurd. Anyway, the only value to exploiting it is that if for some reason the web browser trusted localhost in some way or another (e.g. maybe it lets you do special things with JavaScript that would otherwise be denied). I don't think this is the case for most browsers. And then there's always phishing, but I think we agree that's also pretty absurd.  ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=577270#c4)  Gabriel Burt    2009-05-04 16:22:58 UTC  ``` I have pushed a fix to both the stable branch (from which 1.4.4 will be released) and master (from which 1.5.0 etc will come). ``` |  |

Subject: [Fwd: Cross-Site Scripting in Banshee DAAP Extension]

I've notified Redhat and the Novell/SuSE security teams about a
vulnerability in Banshee's DAAP extension. I have requested a CVE name
for this. I will update this list when I have received the actual CVE
name.

I would like to reserve a CVE name for a cross-site scripting
vulnerability in the DAAP extension of Banshee. A description of the
vulnerability can be found in the GNOME bugzilla
(<http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=577270>).
I have notified the RedHat and SuSE/Novell security teams. I consider
the bugzilla a notification to the upstream vendor (which also happens
to be Novell anyway).
Upstream vendor is aware that I'm requesting this CVE name.

I'm still waiting for RHSA and SUSE-SA numbers. I'll follow up when I
have them.

Thank you in advance,
- Tony
