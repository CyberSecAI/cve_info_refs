The provided content is related to CVE-2009-1282.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `SESS_updateSessionTime` function in `/private/system/lib-session.php`. When the session ID is not MD5-hashed, the function constructs an SQL query that directly uses the session ID from the cookie without proper sanitization. This allows for SQL injection via the `glf_session` cookie.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning the attacker cannot directly see the results of the query but can infer information through timing delays or error messages.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `COM_applyFilter` function does not adequately sanitize the session ID before it's used in the SQL query, allowing for injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL statements:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary SQL queries against the application's database.
- **Data Exfiltration:** This can be used to extract sensitive data, such as user credentials (hashes).
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database permissions and the specific SQL queries injected, it could potentially lead to privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Cookie:** The attack vector is through the `glf_session` cookie. The attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the cookie value.
- **Specifically, SESS_updateSessionTime()** function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the target system and an active session.
- A user account on the target system, even a basic one, is required to log in and obtain a valid session ID.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with modified cookies to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs a working MySQL database on the target system, version 4.1 or higher to use subqueries, version 5.0.12 or higher for SLEEP().
- The default configuration of the application must not use MD5 hashing for session IDs.
