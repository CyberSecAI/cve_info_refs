  "CVE-2009-1587": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insecure cookie handling in PHP Site Lock 2.0.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The application relies on client-side cookies for authentication and authorization.",
         "The application does not properly validate or sanitize the cookie values, allowing manipulation by the attacker."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the application by manipulating the cookie values.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker needs to use JavaScript to modify the cookies in the user's browser. This is done via the `document.cookie` property, before accessing the application."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
         "The attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript code into the victim's browser session or convince the victim to execute the provided JavaScript code.",
          "The attacker needs to know the appropriate values for the `group_id`, `login_name`, `user_id`, and `user_type` cookies that correspond to an administrator account."
       ],
        "additional_notes": [
          "The exploit requires setting multiple cookies one after another, as combining the cookie assignments may not work.",
            "The proof-of-concept demonstrates how to gain administrative access by setting the cookies to administrator-related values."
