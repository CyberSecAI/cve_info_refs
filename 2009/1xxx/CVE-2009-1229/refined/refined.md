Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-1229

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure cookie handling in the Arcadwy Arcade Script. The application does not properly sanitize or validate the 'user' cookie, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application trusts the user-provided data in the 'user' cookie without proper validation.
- **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the 'user' cookie with SQL syntax, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can gain administrative access to the application by crafting a malicious cookie.
- **Potential Data Manipulation:**  With administrative access, the attacker could potentially modify or extract sensitive data from the database, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attack is performed by setting a malicious value for the 'user' cookie via JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Browser with JavaScript Enabled:** The attacker needs to be able to execute Javascript code to set the malicious cookie in the browser.
- **No prior Authentication required:** The vulnerability is triggered during authentication, so no prior access is required

**Technical Details**
The exploit code provided shows how to set the cookie using javascript:

```javascript
javascript:document.cookie = "user=[admin_id],' or ' 1=1--; path=/";
```

This injects SQL code into the query used to authenticate the user.
The specific value `user=1,' or ' 1=1--` will effectively bypass the authentication logic.
The `path=/` ensures the cookie is valid for all paths in the domain.

The vulnerability allows any user to log in as an administrator.
