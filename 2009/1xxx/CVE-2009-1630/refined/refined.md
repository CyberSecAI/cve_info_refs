{
  "CVE-2009-1630": {
    "Root cause": "The nfs_permission function in fs/nfs/dir.c in the NFS client implementation does not properly check execute permissions when atomic_open is available.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper permission check",
      "Bypass of file access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can bypass execute permissions on files accessed via an NFSv4 mount, potentially leading to privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access to the system",
      "NFSv4 mount"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user with access to an NFSv4 mounted file system."
  }
}
