  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1830",
      "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Soulseek client during distributed file searching.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "SEH overwrite"
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. It could also potentially be used to cause a denial of service.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted distributed search query sent over the network to a specific user or an entire Soulseek IRC channel.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a malicious search request to a vulnerable Soulseek client.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in the handling of search queries, allowing an attacker to overwrite the Structured Exception Handler (SEH). The exploit code provided overwrites the SEH with the address of a shellcode, leading to arbitrary code execution. The provided proof of concept targets a specific user, but it can be modified to target an entire channel. The vulnerability affects Soulseek versions 157 NS and 156.x, running on Windows operating systems."
