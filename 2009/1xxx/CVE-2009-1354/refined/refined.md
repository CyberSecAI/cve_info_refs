- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The web server does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to use ".." sequences in the URL to traverse the file system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can access arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially including sensitive configuration files like `boot.ini`.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with directory traversal sequences in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
