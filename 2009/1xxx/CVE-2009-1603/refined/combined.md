How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# OpenSC: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200908-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in OpenSC.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/opensc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.11.8** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.11.8** |

### Background

OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart cards.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in OpenSC:

* b.badrignans discovered that OpenSC incorrectly initialises private
  data objects (CVE-2009-0368).
* Miquel Comas Marti discovered
  that src/tools/pkcs11-tool.c in pkcs11-tool in OpenSC 0.11.7, when used
  with unspecified third-party PKCS#11 modules, generates RSA keys with
  incorrect public exponents (CVE-2009-1603).

### Impact

The first vulnerabilty allows physically proximate attackers to bypass
intended PIN requirements and read private data objects. The second
vulnerability allows attackers to read the cleartext form of messages
that were intended to be encrypted.

NOTE: Smart cards which were initialised using an affected version of
OpenSC need to be modified or re-initialised. See the vendor's advisory
for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/opensc-0.11.8"
```

Subject: OpenSC 0.11.8 released with security update

OpenSC 0.11.8 was released yesterday with a security update.

The security problem in short: you need a combination of
1.) a tool that startes a key generation with public exponent set to 1
    (an invalid value that causes an insecure rsa key)
2.) a PKCS#11 module that accepts that this public exponent and forwards
    it to the card
3.) a card that accepts the public exponent and generates the rsa key.

OpenSC is insecure because due to a code bug in pkcs11-tool it had
the wrong public exponent. But OpenSC PKCS#11 module is secure, it
ignores the public exponent. So only if you generate your keys with
pkcs11-tool from OpenSC 0.11.7 (which very few people do), and only if
you used it with sone other vendors PKCS#11 module, and only if the
card accepted the bogus value too, then your rsa key is unsecure.

you can easily verify keys by looking at the rsa public key or a
certificate or certificate request, for example the openssl command
line tools can print the content in plain text. public Exponent = 1
is bad (3 and higher are accepted values, 65537 or higher is suggested
by the NIST).

Here is the full security advisory. No CVE included, as I was not able
to get one from distributions, vendor-sec or mitre.

OpenSC Security Advisory [07-May-2009]
======================================

pkcs11-tool generates RSA keys with publicExponent 1 instead of 65537

OpenSC includes a tool for testing its PKCS#11 module called pkcs11-tool.
This command line tool includes the ability to ask the PKCS#11 module
to generate an RSA key pair. The tool used to default to a key size
of 768 bits and a public exponent of 3. These values are considered
small but ok. In december 2008 a change (SVN commit 3602) changed
these values to more secure default values of 1024 bit key size
and a public exponent of 65537. A bug in that code however caused
the default public exponent to be 1. That value is invalid and
insecure, a message encrypted with it will be unencrypted.

If pkcs11-tool is used with the PKCS#11 module included in OpenSC,
there is no security issue, as OpenSC PKCS#11 module ignores any
public exponent passed to it. Only when pkcs11-tool is used with
other third party PKCS#11 Modules the problem comes up.

Thanks to Miquel Comas Martí, who found and fixed this bug and
contacted us on May 7th, 2009.

This bug only affects users of OpenSC SVN trunk or OpenSC release
0.11.7. Older releases do not contain this problem, and the new
OpenSC release 0.11.8 fixes this problem. Only users of the command
line tool "pkcs11-tool" are affected by this problem, and only the
generate rsa key pair function is affected ("--keypairgen" or "-k").
There is no option to configure the public exponent using the
command line tool, so all such uses are affected.

The command line tool "pkcs11-tool" can be used with the OpenSC
PKCS#11 Module "opensc-pkcs11.so" or "opensc-pkcs11.dll" or with any
other PKCS#11 module. Only when used with other PKCS#11 module the
problem arrises, as the OpenSC PKCS#11 Module ignores the public
exponent passed to it.

If you use a third party PKCS#11 Module with pkcs11-tool you
can use openssl with engine_pkcs11 to create a certificate
signing request and then use openssl to analyze that csr,
for example
  openssl req -in req.pem -noout -text
  ...
                Exponent: 1 (0x1)
  ...

Would show the problem.

The problem is fixed with the new OpenSC release 0.11.8
available on <http://www.opensc-project.org/> or here:

Contact and Feedback
====================

If you have questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to contact us on our
mailing lists "opensc-devel" or "opensc-user". You need to subscribe to these
lists before posting, as we are getting a lot of spam each day and do not have
the resource to sort out valid email.

Also our wiki and bug trackers are only working for old users. New users can't
register at the moment, both wiki and the bug tracker was spammed too much.
Please send an email to the mailing list and we can manually create a user for
you.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
