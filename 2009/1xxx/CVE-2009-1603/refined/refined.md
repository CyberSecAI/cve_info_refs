Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-1603:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A code bug in the `pkcs11-tool` within OpenSC caused it to generate RSA keys with an incorrect public exponent of 1, instead of the intended 65537.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Public Exponent:** The `pkcs11-tool` was generating RSA keys with a public exponent of 1, which is an invalid and insecure value, rendering the generated keys weak.
- **PKCS#11 Module Dependency:** The vulnerability was exposed when `pkcs11-tool` was used with third-party PKCS#11 modules that accepted the invalid public exponent. The OpenSC PKCS#11 module was not vulnerable as it ignores any passed public exponent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Insecure RSA keys:** RSA keys generated using the vulnerable `pkcs11-tool` with a third-party PKCS#11 module and a vulnerable card were insecure.
- **Plaintext Exposure:** Messages encrypted with these insecure keys could be easily decrypted, exposing the cleartext of what was intended to be secured.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:**  The vulnerability was exploitable by a user with local access to a system running the vulnerable `pkcs11-tool` and a third-party PKCS#11 module along with a vulnerable smart card

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local user:** An attacker would need local access to the system to execute the vulnerable `pkcs11-tool` with a third-party PKCS#11 module.
- **Specific tool usage:** The user would have to be using the `pkcs11-tool` to generate RSA keys with third-party modules and a smart card that does not check the exponent..

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in OpenSC version 0.11.7 and SVN trunk.
- OpenSC's own PKCS#11 module is not vulnerable due to its handling of public exponents.
- The vulnerability was fixed in OpenSC version 0.11.8.
- Users are advised to verify their RSA keys if they used a vulnerable version of the tool and with a third-party module.
- Affected keys should be regenerated if a public exponent of '1' is present.

This information provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its cause, impact, and how it can be exploited, along with the required conditions for exploitation.
