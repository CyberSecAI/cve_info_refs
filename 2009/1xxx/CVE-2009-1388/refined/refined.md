Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1388:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a deadlock condition that occurs when the `ptrace_start()` function, used for process tracing, races with the `do_coredump()` function, which handles core dumping. Specifically, the `ptrace_start()` function spins waiting for a child process to enter a `TASK_TRACED` or `TASK_STOPPED` state. Simultaneously, if a coredump is initiated for a process, `do_coredump()` waits for the tracer process to exit and report completion. If the tracer is also involved in the coredump process (e.g., it shares the same memory management structure `mm`), a deadlock can occur because each process is waiting on the other.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Deadlock:** The primary vulnerability is a deadlock condition. `ptrace_start()` waits for child to be traced, while `do_coredump()` waits for the tracer to exit, creating a circular dependency if both are involved with the same process.
- **Spinning in `ptrace_start()`:** The `ptrace_start()` function spins in a loop waiting for the tracee to stop, without proper checks for coredump activity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The deadlock results in a system hang. The affected processes become unresponsive, and in some cases, the system may become unusable, requiring a reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Process Tracing and Core Dumping:** The attack vector involves initiating a trace on a process and simultaneously triggering a coredump. This can be achieved by having a tracer process and a tracee process, both sharing the same `mm`, and causing a coredump of one process while the other is being traced.
- **Specific Kernel Versions:** This issue primarily affects the 2.6.18 Linux kernel, particularly in environments like OpenVZ, and it is not found in the upstream kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **User Level Access:** An attacker doesn't need root privileges to trigger this vulnerability, according to the bug report.
- **Ability to Execute Programs:** The attacker needs to be able to execute programs that utilize `ptrace` and cause a core dump in the process.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

- The `ptrace_start()` function is modified to abort if `child->mm->core_waiters != 0` to avoid the deadlock, using a check if `child->exit_state` or `(child->flags & PF_SIGNALED)` to detect exit conditions.
- The provided code snippets show a fix involves an additional check in `ptrace_start` to see if the child is in the process of core dumping (`child->mm->core_waiters`) and abort the trace attempt.
- The bug report also suggests that the fix should consider the `SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT` flag to avoid false positives.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

-  The vulnerability is addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via RHSA-2009:1193.
- Patches were proposed by both OpenVZ team and a Red Hat developer named Oleg Nesterov.
- VMware also included this CVE in a security advisory for their products, VMSA-2009-0016.

In summary, CVE-2009-1388 is a deadlock vulnerability in the Linux kernel's ptrace and coredump functionalities that can lead to a denial-of-service. It requires a specific sequence of events involving process tracing and core dumps, but can be triggered by a user-level attacker.
