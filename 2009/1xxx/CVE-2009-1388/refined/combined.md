Subject:    [oss-security] CVE-2009-1388 kernel: do_coredump() vs ptrace_start() deadlock
From:       [Eugene Teo <eugene () redhat ! com>](?a=123544296600013&r=1&w=2)
Date:       [2009-07-02 12:40:27](?l=oss-security&r=1&w=2&b=200907)
Message-ID: [4A4CAABB.8030407 () redhat ! com](?i=4A4CAABB.8030407%20()%20redhat%20!%20com)
[Download RAW [message](?l=oss-security&m=124654277229434&q=mbox) or [body](?l=oss-security&m=124654277229434&q=raw)]

The OpenVZ Linux kernel team has found deadlock between ptrace and
coredump code. It affects 2.6.18 but does not affect the upstream kernel.

"ptrace_start() spins waiting for child->state ==
TASK_TRACED/TASK_STOPPED. If we race with the coredumping, we have to
wait until it completes.

If the tracer participates in coredumping too, we deadlock.
do_coredump() waits for tracer to exit and report
complete(mm->core_startup_done), the tracer spins in an endless loop.

Change ptrace_start() to abort if child->mm->core_waiters != 0."

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.

A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially

I suspect the patch from openvz is not exactly right.  PF_SIGNALED is always set when the thread is killed by the fatal signal, if we check this flag in ptrace_start() I'm afraid we can have a false positive when the exiting tracee calls tracehook_report_exit().  Also. There is no guarantee the tracee must have PF_SIGNALED when we are going to deadlock. Suppose the tracee just exits and sleeps in TASK_TRACED because of PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT. The tracer calls ptrace_start(). After that another thread which shares the same ->mm starts the coredump. zap_process() wakes up the tracee, it calls exit_mm()->wait_for_completion() and sleeps in D state but without PF_SIGNALED.   We could add the SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT check:          --- a/kernel/ptrace.c         +++ b/kernel/ptrace.c         @@ -933,7 +933,8 @@ ptrace_start(long pid, long request,                  */                 wait_task_inactive(child);                 while (child->state != TASK_TRACED && child->state != TASK_STOPPED) {         -               if (child->exit_state) {         +               if (child->exit_state ||         +                  (current->signal->flags & SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT)) {                                 __ptrace_state_free(state);                                 goto out_tsk;                         }  If we race with the coredumping thread which shares the same ->mm, the tracer should be killed by SIGKILL too. In that case we can just return, the error code does not matter because we will never return to the user-space.  (This patch could also help if the rt tracer preempts the tracee, we  can spin forever in this case. At least, with this check we can kill  the tracer. However, without fixing wait_task_inactive() this doesn't  really help).  The patch above should fix this deadlock, but unfortunately it does not solve all problems. Note that with this test-case the tracer, tracee, and the coredumping thread share the same ->mm. This is because it was written originally to exploit another problem fixed by 5ecfbae093f0c37311e89b29bfc0c9d586eace87.  But what if the tracer does not participate in coredumping? In that case the tracer is not killed, and we still have problems. The tracer will spin until the coredump completes. So I'd suggest this patch.  Untested, not even compiled. Just for review/discussion.   Also. Upstream checks mm->core_state in may_ptrace_stop() to prevent another deadlock (and it is still needed afaics, despite the fact schedule() now checks signal_pending_state()). I wonder if RHEL needs something like this check. utrace_quiescent() checks sigkill_pending(), but if SIGKILL was already dequeued it can return false. This means that if the tracer, tracee, and the coredumping thread share the same ->mm we can deadlock. Fortunately, sigkill_pending() == F also means we can send the private SIGKILL to the tracee and wake it up, but I guess this won't be obvious to admin.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=504263#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-04 13:15:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1193 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1193.html>   ``` |  |

PF_SIGNALED is always set when the thread is killed by the fatal signal, if we check this flag in ptrace_start() I'm afraid we can have a false positive when the exiting tracee calls tracehook_report_exit().  Also. There is no guarantee the tracee must have PF_SIGNALED when we are going to deadlock. Suppose the tracee just exits and sleeps in TASK_TRACED because of PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT. The tracer calls ptrace_start(). After that another thread which shares the same ->mm starts the coredump. zap_process() wakes up the tracee, it calls exit_mm()->wait_for_completion() and sleeps in D state but without PF_SIGNALED.   We could add the SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT check:          --- a/kernel/ptrace.c         +++ b/kernel/ptrace.c         @@ -933,7 +933,8 @@ ptrace_start(long pid, long request,                  */                 wait_task_inactive(child);                 while (child->state != TASK_TRACED && child->state != TASK_STOPPED) {         -               if (child->exit_state) {         +               if (child->exit_state ||         +                  (current->signal->flags & SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT)) {                                 __ptrace_state_free(state);                                 goto out_tsk;                         }  If we race with the coredumping thread which shares the same ->mm, the tracer should be killed by SIGKILL too. In that case we can just return, the error code does not matter because we will never return to the user-space.  (This patch could also help if the rt tracer preempts the tracee, we  can spin forever in this case. At least, with this check we can kill  the tracer. However, without fixing wait_task_inactive() this doesn't  really help).  The patch above should fix this deadlock, but unfortunately it does not solve all problems. Note that with this test-case the tracer, tracee, and the coredumping thread share the same ->mm. This is because it was written originally to exploit another problem fixed by 5ecfbae093f0c37311e89b29bfc0c9d586eace87.  But what if the tracer does not participate in coredumping? In that case the tracer is not killed, and we still have problems. The tracer will spin until the coredump completes. So I'd suggest this patch.  Untested, not even compiled. Just for review/discussion.   Also. Upstream checks mm->core_state in may_ptrace_stop() to prevent another deadlock (and it is still needed afaics, despite the fact schedule() now checks signal_pending_state()). I wonder if RHEL needs something like this check. utrace_quiescent() checks sigkill_pending(), but if SIGKILL was already dequeued it can return false. This means that if the tracer, tracee, and the coredumping thread share the same ->mm we can deadlock. Fortunately, sigkill_pending() == F also means we can send the private SIGKILL to the tracee and wake it up, but I guess this won't be obvious to admin.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=504263#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-08-04 13:15:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2009:1193 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1193.html>   ``` |  |
