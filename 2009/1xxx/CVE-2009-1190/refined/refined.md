{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `java.util.regex.Pattern.compile` method in Sun JDK 1.5 has a performance issue when handling regular expressions with many optional groups, causing exponential compilation times. This is due to algorithmic complexity within the regex processing. This issue was partially addressed in JDK 1.4.2_06, but the root cause was not resolved until JDK 1.6.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in regular expression processing.",
       "Improper handling of optional groups in regular expressions.",
       "Vulnerability present in `JdkRegexpMethodPointcut` via its inherited `readObject` method from `AbstractRegexpMethodPointcut`"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending specially crafted serializable data containing long regular expressions with many optional groups. This leads to excessive CPU consumption on the server, potentially rendering the service unavailable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending malicious serializable data to a server using Spring Framework that uses `JdkRegexpMethodPointcut` and is running on vulnerable JDK 1.5",
       "Exploiting the `readObject` method of `JdkRegexpMethodPointcut` that calls `Pattern.compile`."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
       "Ability to send serializable data to the targeted server.",
        "Knowledge of the vulnerable components and how to craft the malicious regular expression payload."
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when `Pattern.compile(source[i])` is called via the `readObject` method of `JdkRegexpMethodPointcut`. This call is performed during deserialization of a crafted object containing a long regex with multiple optional groups, which is computationally expensive, leading to high CPU usage and denial of service. The issue is related to CVE-2004-2540."
