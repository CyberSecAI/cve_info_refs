**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content includes multiple sources that directly mention CVE-2009-1179 and describe a vulnerability related to the processing of JBIG2 data in PDF files. This aligns with the official description of CVE-2009-1179, which involves an integer overflow in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files containing JBIG2 streams.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** An integer overflow exists in the CoreGraphics component when handling PDF files containing JBIG2 streams. This overflow leads to a heap buffer overflow.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Integer overflow in CoreGraphics' handling of PDF files with JBIG2 streams.
    *   Heap buffer overflow resulting from the integer overflow.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Unexpected application termination (crash)
    *   Arbitrary code execution.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Opening a maliciously crafted PDF file.
    *   Visiting a website hosting such a PDF file.
    *   Downloading a PDF file containing a malicious JBIG2 stream.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to create a malicious PDF file with a specially crafted JBIG2 stream.
    *   Ability to deliver the crafted PDF file to the target user (e.g., via email, website).
    *   No user interaction (beyond opening the malicious PDF) is needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**3. Additional Technical Details and Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in CoreGraphics of Mac OS X, iOS and other applications using the same code.
*   The flaw is present in the JBIG2 decoding part of the code.
*   The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.
