{
  "CVE-2009-1891": {
    "description": "The mod_deflate module in Apache httpd 2.2.11 and earlier compresses large files until completion even after the associated network connection is closed, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption).",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The mod_deflate module does not check if the network connection has been closed before continuing to compress the data.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unnecessary CPU consumption",
        "Lack of connection status checks"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by causing the server to use excessive CPU resources.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote network requests",
         "Aborting connection mid-transfer."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and must be able to abruptly terminate the network connection. The attacker also must have knowledge of at least one large file served by the target with mod_deflate enabled."
    }
