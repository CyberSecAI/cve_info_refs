Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-1295:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `apport` package's cron job (`/etc/cron.daily/apport`) responsible for cleaning up old crash reports in the `/var/crash` directory. The original implementation used `find` commands with `-mindepth` option and piped the results to `rm -f`. This approach was flawed because it did not prevent `find` from traversing subdirectories within `/var/crash`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** An attacker could exploit the time window between when `find` lists a directory and when `rm` is executed on it by changing the directory into a symlink, thereby causing `rm -f` to delete arbitrary files outside the `/var/crash` directory. This was possible due to `/var/crash` being world-writable.
*   **Insecure Directory Traversal:** The original script did not prevent `find` from traversing deep into subdirectories, making it vulnerable to the symlink attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** A local attacker could potentially delete arbitrary files on the system, leading to data loss or system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to create directories and symlinks within `/var/crash`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create directories and symbolic links in the world-writable `/var/crash` directory.
*   The attacker needs to be aware that `apport` is configured to clean up `/var/crash`.
*   The attacker needs to introduce a time delay by e.g. creating very large directory trees, to maximize the chances of the race condition being exploitable.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the `find` commands in the `apport` cron job to:

*   **Limit Traversal:**  `-maxdepth 1` and `-type f` options were introduced to restrict `find` to only consider files in `/var/crash` directory and not descend into subdirectories.
*  **Portable find command**: the `-print0` and `xargs -0` were removed in favor of the standard `find ... -exec rm -f {} +`.
*   **Further hardening:** Added `--` to `rm` command to ensure filenames with leading dashes are handled correctly.

This change prevents the symlink attack and ensures that `rm -f` only removes files directly within the `/var/crash` directory, and not those outside that directory through symlinks.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially thought to be exploitable using FUSE filesystems, but this was later determined to not be the case on Ubuntu systems due to default FUSE configuration restrictions, however, the core issue of a race condition while traversing directories using `find` persisted.
*  The issue was fixed in different versions of `apport` for different Ubuntu releases.
*   The vulnerability is a classic race condition attack as described in GNU find documentation.
*   The security fix included the use of `-prune` within the `find` command to improve its portability across different versions of `find`, as well as avoiding the non-standard options.
