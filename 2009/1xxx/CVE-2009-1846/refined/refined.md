```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a user-supplied value, `$THEME_FOLDER`, directly in a PHP `include` statement without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or arbitrary code execution, if an attacker could include a file with PHP code.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `THEME_FOLDER` GET parameter in a request to a vulnerable PHP file (e.g., `homepage.php`).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability."
