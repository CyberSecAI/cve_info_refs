Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-1758:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A missing check in the `hypervisor_callback()` function within the Xen hypervisor's i386/x86 Linux kernel patch allowed a user-mode application in a Xen guest to trigger a kernel oops (a type of crash). Specifically, the code didn't properly validate the code selector of the interrupted code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient validation:** The `hypervisor_callback()` function lacked a critical check on the return address, allowing for jumps to unintended locations within the critical region.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A malicious user-mode application within a Xen guest could cause a kernel panic (oops), resulting in a denial of service within the guest OS.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local guest exploitation:** A user-mode application running within a Xen guest operating system could exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a Xen guest operating system. The vulnerability can be triggered through normal execution of a crafted or malicious user-space application inside a Xen guest.

**Technical details from the patch:**
The provided patch in `lists.xensource.com` shows the code changes that fix this issue. The relevant changes are as follows:
1. Added a check: `testb $2,CS(%esp)` to verify if the code segment of the interrupted code is from user mode. If the code is not from user mode, the code jumps to the upcall handler `.Ldo_upcall`. This prevents user space from corrupting kernel state via the hypervisor entry.
2. Removed redundant checks and code: Some checks related to supervisor mode kernels were removed because supervisor mode isn't actively used. It also streamlined `critical_region_fixup` code by removing branch instructions.
3.  Replaced numeric labels with named local labels: This was done to improve the code's readability and remove a "fragile" numeric label usage across 300 lines of code.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the Xen hypervisor when running on i386/x86 architectures.
*   The issue was fixed in Linux kernel version 2.6.26-15lenny3 in Debian.
*   The vulnerability is described as a "local" issue, since it can be exploited by a user inside the guest OS itself.
*   This information is more detailed than the brief description provided in the initial CVE description.
