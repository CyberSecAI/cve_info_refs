How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Further adjustments: - the 'main' critical region does not include the jmp following the   disabling of interrupts - the sysexit_[se]crit range checks got broken at some point - the   sysexit ciritcal region is always at higher addresses than the 'main'   one, yielding the check pointless (but consuming execution time);   since the supervisor mode kernel isn't actively used afaict, I moved   that code into an #ifdef using a hypothetical config option - the use of a numeric label across more than 300 lines of code always   seemed pretty fragile to me, so the patch replaces this with a local   named label - streamlined the critical_region_fixup code to eliminate a branch  As usual, written and tested on 2.6.30-rc4 and made apply to the 2.6.18 tree without further testing.

    Frank Filz discovered that local users may be able to execute
    files without execute permission when accessed via an nfs4 mount.

CVE-2009-1633

    Jeff Layton and Suresh Jayaraman fixed several buffer overflows in
    the CIFS filesystem which allow remote servers to cause memory
    corruption.

CVE-2009-1758

    Jan Beulich discovered an issue in Xen where local guest users may
    cause a denial of service (oops).

This update also fixes a regression introduced by the fix for
CVE-2009-1184 in 2.6.26-15lenny3. This prevents a boot time panic on
systems with SELinux enabled.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.26-15lenny3.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems, where
applicable, will be fixed in future updates to linux-2.6 and
linux-2.6.24.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux
packages.

Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 5.0 (lenny)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.26-1um-2+15lenny3

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Subject: CVE Request: XEN local denial of service

Hi,

<http://lists.xensource.com/archives/html/xen-devel/2009-05/msg00561.html>

A user mode application running in a x86 32bit Xen Guest could Ooops (denial of service)
of the guest by causing a segfault in certain address ranges.

(Just jumping to an address between "ecrit" and "scrit" symbols is sufficient.)

This is not a mainline Linux kernel issue, the bug is in the XEN patchset against
the Linux kernel.

Ciao, Marcus
