```
Package: eggdrop
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hi,
turns out my patch has a bug in it which opens this up for a
buffer overflow again in case strlen(ctcpbuf) returns 0:
<http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/fulldisc/full-disclosure/68341>

Too bad noone noticed that before.
I am going to upload a 0-day NMU now to fix this.

debdiff available on:
<http://people.debian.org/~nion/nmu-diff/eggdrop-1.6.19-1.1_1.6.19-1.2.patch>

(includes the wrong bug number to close as I tried to reopen it fist but it failed because it was already archived).

Cheers
Nico

does this mean that DSA-1448 needs to be reissued?  and is that in the
works?  should the etch fixed version get removed from the DSA list to
reindicate that etch is vulnerable?

Yes

No

No there will be a -2 DSA if any that reflects the previous
fix being incomplete.

Cheers

P.S. this belongs on the testing-security team mailing list

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2009-1789

| **Name** | CVE-2009-1789 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | mod/server.mod/servmsg.c in Eggheads Eggdrop and Windrop 1.6.19 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PRIVMSG that causes an empty string to trigger a negative string length copy. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2007-2807. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

eggdrop/windrop remote crash vulnerability

    * This message: [ Message body ] [ More options ]

From: Thomas Sader <thommey_at_gmail.com>
Date: Fri, 15 May 2009 05:54:08 +0200

Affected software
-----------------

eggdrop (1.6.19 only, not 1.6.19+ctcpfix)
windrop (1.6.19 only, not 1.6.19+ctcpfix)
all eggdrop/windrop versions and packages which apply Nico Goldes
patch for CVE-2007-2807/SA25276 See: [1]

Vulnerability details
---------------------

The SA25276 patch ([1]) uses strncpy to fix a buffer overflow vulnerability
in src/mod/server.mod/servmsg.c (gotmsg). The last argument is not checked
for being non-negative, but that can happen if ctcpbuf is "". That causes
a remote crash vulnerability to be exploited by anyone connected to the same
IRC network as eggdrop. The SA25276 patch has been applied to the eggdrop1.6.18
debian package and was later adopted by Eggheads into eggdrop1.6.19.

One possible exploit anyone can send to the IRC server to crash eggdrop:

PRIVMSG eggdrop :\1\1

Resolution
----------

Upgrade to eggdrop/windrop 1.6.19+ctcpfix ([2],[3]), the current cvs versions,
or apply the ctcpfix patch at [2] before compiling.

Disclosure timeline
-------------------

2009-05-06: Vulnerability discovered and reported to Eggheads.
2009-05-06: Patch committed to cvs.
2009-05-14: New eggdrop and windrop version released with the fix applied.
2009-05-14: Public disclosure.

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Package        : eggdrop
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2807 CVE-2009-1789
Debian Bugs    : 427157 528778

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in eggdrop, an advanced IRC
robot. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2007-2807

It was discovered that eggdrop is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, which
could result in a remote user executing arbitrary code. The previous DSA
(DSA-1448-1) did not fix the issue correctly.

CVE-2009-1789

It was discovered that eggdrop is vulnerable to a denial of service
attack, that allows remote attackers to cause a crash via a crafted
PRIVMSG.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.19-1.1+lenny1.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.18-1etch2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.19-1.2

We recommend that you upgrade your eggdrop package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
