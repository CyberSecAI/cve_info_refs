  "CVE-2009-1530": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "details": [
      "The specific flaw exists when repeatedly calling event handlers after adding nodes of an HTML document. When a specially crafted webpage is repeatedly rendered, memory is improperly reused after it has been freed.",
      "Due to the controllable nature of the web browser, this vulnerability can be exploited to remotely compromise a system running under the security context of the currently logged in user."
    ],
    "affected_versions": [
      "Internet Explorer 7"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Improper memory reuse after it has been freed when calling event handlers after adding nodes of an HTML document.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, gaining the same user rights as the logged-on user, complete control of an affected system.",
    "attack_vector": "Specially crafted web page.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a specially crafted web page and convince a user to view it.",
