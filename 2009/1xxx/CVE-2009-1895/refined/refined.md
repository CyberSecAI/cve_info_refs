  "CVE-2009-1895": {
    "description": "Julien Tinnes and Tavis Ormandy reported and issue in the Linux vulnerability code. Local users can take advantage of a setuid binary that can either be made to dereference a NULL pointer or drop privileges and return control to the user. This allows a user to bypass mmap_min_addr restrictions which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.",
    "root_cause": "The personality subsystem in the Linux kernel does not clear the `ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT` and `MMAP_PAGE_ZERO` flags when executing a setuid or setgid program.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `PER_CLEAR_ON_SETID` setting does not clear the `ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT` and `MMAP_PAGE_ZERO` flags when executing a setuid or setgid program.",
     "Failure to properly clear personality flags on setuid/setgid execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can bypass the `mmap_min_addr` protection mechanism, conduct NULL pointer dereference attacks, or defeat address space layout randomization (ASLR) making privilege escalation possible.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A local user executes a setuid or setgid binary.",
        "The vulnerability can be exploited by utilizing a setuid binary that can be made to dereference a NULL pointer or drop privileges and return control to the user."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access is required. The attacker needs to execute a setuid binary and control its execution to map memory at address 0 or bypass privilege restrictions."
