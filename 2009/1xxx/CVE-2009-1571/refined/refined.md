        "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a specific HTML file to trigger the vulnerability.",
         "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is due to an incorrect memory handling in the HTML parser when insufficient space is available to process HTML input. Memory occupied by in-use objects is freed and filled with text from the HTML body. This can result in arbitrary code execution when calling methods from these freed objects.  The issue lies within the core string classes, specifically `nsTSubstring_CharT::SetLength`.  The function `Capacity()` incorrectly returns `PRUint32(-1)` when the string is immutable instead of 0. There is also an early return in SetLength which doesn't guarantee that the string is mutable."
