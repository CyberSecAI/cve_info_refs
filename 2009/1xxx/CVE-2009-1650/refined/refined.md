Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-1650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the Shutter photo gallery software version 0.1.1, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `albumID`, `tagID`, and `photoID` GET parameters. This means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into these parameters, which are then used in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as user information, database structure, and other application data.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (via Shell Upload):** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can write a PHP shell to the server by injecting malicious code into an `INTO OUTFILE` clause which would create a php file and allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server if they have permissions to create files.
- **Complete System Compromise:** If successful, this would allow the attacker to take full control of the server and any information it has.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploited by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests, specifically by modifying the parameters `albumID`, `tagID`, and `photoID`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL injection queries.
- **Permissions to Create Files**: If the attacker would like to take full control of the system by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, they would need to have permissions to create files.
