  "CVE-2009-1839": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "Security researchers Adam Barth and Collin Jackson reported that when a file: resource is loaded via the location bar it inherits the principal of the previously loaded document. This vulnerability can potentially give the newly loaded document additional privileges to access resources that it wouldn't otherwise have, including resources in the document's parent folder."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "When a file: resource is loaded via the location bar, it incorrectly inherits the principal (security context) of the previously loaded document.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect privilege inheritance",
        "Insufficient access control"
      ],
      "Impact": "Information disclosure. A malicious local document, loaded through the location bar, could potentially gain access to resources it normally would not be permitted to access, including files in the parent directory of another local document loaded before.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "Loading a malicious file through the location bar after loading a 'target' file through the location bar.",
          "User needs to have a malicious file on their local machine, open a legitimate file through the location bar, then open the malicious file in the same window via location bar"
      ],
      "Attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick a user into downloading a malicious file. The attacker needs the user to load a legitimate file, then load a malicious file in the same window via the browser's location bar. This attack is dependent on the user's browsing behavior.",
      "Affected software": "Mozilla Firefox browser. Xulrunner (runtime for XUL applications) is also affected. Specifically version 3.0.11 and earlier."
