Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an insufficient check on non-200 responses received from proxy servers when a CONNECT request is sent. Specifically, the response body of non-200 responses is incorrectly rendered within the context of the requested `Host:` header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Context Rendering:** The browser renders the response body from a proxy within the context of the requested host, even when the response code indicates an error or non-success.
*   **Missing Input Validation/Sanitization**: The browser does not properly validate or sanitize non-200 responses from proxies, allowing for the injection of malicious content.
*   **Insufficient Handling of Error Responses:** The browser does not treat non-200 proxy responses as errors, instead attempting to process them as valid responses from the target domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker could intercept a CONNECT request to a proxy server and reply with a malicious non-200 response.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The malicious code within the non-200 response would be executed in the context of the victim's requested SSL-protected domain.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially steal sensitive data such as cookies of the requested site if present in the browser.
*   **Spoofing:** An attacker can potentially fake an HTTPS page using this vulnerability, and lead the user to believe that they are visiting the legit site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attack is achieved through an active network attacker who can intercept and modify traffic between the user and a proxy server.
*   **Proxy Configuration:** The victim needs to be using a proxy server for this attack to be effective.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Active Network Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic. This is typically on the same network as the victim, or by compromising a router/network equipment in-path.
*   **Proxy Interception:** The attacker needs to intercept the client's request to the proxy and reply to it before the real proxy replies to the client.
*   **Malicious Response Generation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP response.

**Additional Details:**
*  The vulnerability affects Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey.
*  The vulnerability was reported by Microsoft security researchers Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang, and Ming Zhang.
*   The severity of this issue was determined to be high due to the potential for arbitrary code execution and sensitive data exposure.
