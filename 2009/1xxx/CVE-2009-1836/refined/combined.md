The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-27

## SSL tampering via non-200 responses to proxy CONNECT requests

Announced
June 11, 2009
Reporter
Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang, Ming Zhang
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.10
* SeaMonkey 1.1.17
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.22

### Description

Microsoft security researchers **Shuo
Chen**, **Ziqing Mao**, **Yi-Min
Wang**, and **Ming Zhang** reported that when a
CONNECT request is sent to a proxy server and a non-200 response is
returned, then the body of the response is incorrectly rendered
within the context of the request `Host:` header. An
active network attacker could use this vulnerability to intercept a
CONNECT request and reply with a non-200 response containing malicious
code which would be executed within the context of the victim's
requested SSL-protected domain. Since this attack requires the victim
to have a proxy configured, the severity of this issue was determined
to be high.

Thunderbird mail messages are not vulnerable to this flaw,
but if Thunderbird were being used in a browser-like manner (through Add-ons,
perhaps) and JavaScript were enabled (not the default settng) then users could

                 CVE-2009-1841

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications, such as the Iceweasel web
browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2009-1392

Several issues in the browser engine have been discovered, which can
result in the execution of arbitrary code. (MFSA 2009-24)

CVE-2009-1832

It is possible to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving "double
frame construction." (MFSA 2009-24)

CVE-2009-1833

Jesse Ruderman and Adam Hauner discovered a problem in the JavaScript
engine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
(MFSA 2009-24)

CVE-2009-1834

Pavel Cvrcek discovered a potential issue leading to a spoofing attack
on the location bar related to certain invalid unicode characters.
(MFSA 2009-25)

CVE-2009-1835

Gregory Fleischer discovered that it is possible to read arbitrary
cookies via a crafted HTML document. (MFSA 2009-26)

CVE-2009-1836

Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang and Ming Zhang reported a potential
man-in-the-middle attack, when using a proxy due to insufficient checks
on a certain proxy response. (MFSA 2009-27)

CVE-2009-1837

Jakob Balle and Carsten Eiram reported a race condition in the
NPObjWrapper_NewResolve function that can be used to execute arbitrary
code. (MFSA 2009-28)

CVE-2009-1838

moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that it is possible to execute arbitrary
JavaScript with chrome privileges due to an error in the
garbage-collection implementation. (MFSA 2009-29)

CVE-2009-1839

Adam Barth and Collin Jackson reported a potential privilege escalation
when loading a file::resource via the location bar. (MFSA 2009-30)

CVE-2009-1840

Wladimir Palant discovered that it is possible to bypass access
restrictions due to a lack of content policy check, when loading a
script file into a XUL document. (MFSA 2009-31)

CVE-2009-1841

moz_bug_r_a4 reported that it is possible for scripts from page content
to run with elevated privileges and thus potentially executing arbitrary
code with the object's chrome privileges. (MFSA 2009-32)

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.11-0lenny1.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also

You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=503578#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-06-01 18:58:03 UTC  ``` Microsoft security researchers Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang, and Ming Zhang reported that when a CONNECT request is sent to a proxy server and a non-200 response is returned, then the body of the response is incorrectly rendered within the context of the request Host: header. An active network attacker could use this vulnerability to intercept a CONNECT request and reply with a non-200 response containing malicious code which would be executed within the context of the victim's requested SSL-protected domain. Since this attack requires the victim to have a proxy configured, the severity of this issue was determined to be high.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=503578#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 22:46:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1095.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=503578#c3)  Fedora Update System    2009-06-16 02:18:00 UTC  ``` firefox-3.0.11-1.fc10, xulrunner-1.9.0.11-1.fc10, epiphany-2.24.3-7.fc10, epiphany-extensions-2.24.3-2.fc10, blam-1.8.5-11.fc10, devhelp-0.22-9.fc10, galeon-2.0.7-11.fc10, gecko-sharp2-0.13-9.fc10, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-31.fc10, gnome-web-photo-0.3-19.fc10, google-gadgets-0.10.5-7.fc10, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc10.3, Miro-2.0.3-5.fc10, mozvoikko-0.9.5-11.fc10, mugshot-1.2.2-10.fc10, pcmanx-gtk2-0.3.8-10.fc10, perl-Gtk2-MozEmbed-0.08-6.fc10.2, ruby-gnome2-0.18.1-5.fc10.3, yelp-2.24.0-10.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2009-1392, CVE-2009-1832, CVE-2009-1833, CVE-2009-1837, CVE-2009-1838,
CVE-2009-1841)

Multiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed, local file
content. If a user loaded malicious, local content via the file:// URL, it
was possible for that content to access other local data. (CVE-2009-1835,
CVE-2009-1839)

A script, privilege elevation flaw was found in the way Firefox loaded XML
User Interface Language (XUL) scripts. Firefox and certain add-ons could
load malicious content when certain policy checks did not happen.
(CVE-2009-1840)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed certain Unicode characters in
International Domain Names (IDN). If an IDN contained invalid characters,
they may have been displayed as spaces, making it appear to the user that
they were visiting a trusted site. (CVE-2009-1834)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled error responses returned from
proxy servers. If an attacker is able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack
against a Firefox instance that is using a proxy server, they may be able
to steal sensitive information from the site the user is visiting.
(CVE-2009-1836)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 3.0.11. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this errata.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 3.0.11, which corrects these issues. After installing the
update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/docs/DOC-11259>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Pretty-Bad-Proxy: An Overlooked Adversary in Browsers’ HTTPS Deployments

Published by IEEE Computer Society

[Publication](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/PBP-oakland-public.ppt) | [Publication](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/BillGatesComment2007.txt)

HTTPS is designed to provide secure web communications over insecure networks. The protocol itself has been rigorously designed and evaluated by assuming the network as an adversary. This paper is motivated by our curiosity about whether such an adversary has been carefully examined when HTTPS is integrated into the browser/web systems. We focus on a specific adversary named “Pretty-Bad-Proxy” (PBP). PBP is a malicious proxy targeting browsers’ rendering modules above the HTTP/HTTPS layer. It attempts to break the end-to-end security guarantees of HTTPS without breaking any cryptographic scheme. We discovered a set of vulnerabilities exploitable by a PBP: in many realistic network environments where attackers can sniff the browser traffic, they can steal sensitive data from an HTTPS server, fake an HTTPS page and impersonate an authenticated user to access an HTTPS server. These vulnerabilities reflect the neglects in the design of modern browsers – they affect all major browsers and a large number of websites. We believe that the PBP adversary has not been rigorously examined in the browser/web industry. The vendors of the affected browsers have all confirmed the vulnerabilities reported in this paper. Most of them have patched or planned on patching their browsers. We believe the attack scenarios described in this paper may only be a subset of the vulnerabilities under PBP. Thus further (and more rigorous) evaluations of the HTTPS deployments in browsers appear to be necessary.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=479880#c0)• 16 years ago |
|  | |

I bet this bug is already on file, but I don't have access to all the security bugs so I'm filing this one in the hopes that it gets duped against an existing bug.
Threat Model:
1) The user has a proxy server configured.
2) There is an active network attacker.
3) The user visits <https://www.paypal.com/>
Attack:
The browser issues a CONNECT request to the proxy server. The active network attacker intercepts this request and replies with the following bytes:
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
The browser happily runs the network attacker's script in the <https://www.paypal.com> security origin, causing disaster.
Chromium received this bug report (and additional related bugs involving redirects) from Microsoft. My understanding is that some researchers from MSR are going to present about these bugs as the upcoming Oakland Security Conference. We should coordinate so we fix this issue in the same way. More details are available at <<http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=7338>>, which I can give you access to.
Thanks,
Adam

Apparently I'm not allowed to share the paper until May 19, the day of the conference, because it also describes IE vulnerabilities. Shuo said he reported these issues a year ago, but they don't seem to be fixed in Firefox 3. I haven't tested the nightly.
I think the cleanest fix is to treat any non-200 response to a CONNECT request as a network error and disregard any redirects or response body. The benefit of this approach is that it's easy to see that all these vulnerabilities are fixed. The cost of this approach is that the user doesn't get to see fancy error messages from proxies for HTTPS sites.

I don't see any obvious dups in core-security, at least not with proxy, ssl, https, connect in the summary.
nsHttpConnection::OnHeadersAvailable calls nsHttpTransaction::SetSSLConnectFailed. That sets mSSLConnectFailed, which as far as I can tell is only looked at in nsHttpChannel::ProcessResponse in the case of a 407 response; looks to me like if we call trans->SSLConnectFailed() in ProcessResponse before doing anything else we can stop dealing with the response as though it were a normal response.

Attached patch

[proof-of-concept demo patch](attachment.cgi?id=371339&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=371339&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=479880&attachment=371339)

I've verified that Waldo's suggestion in [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=479880#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - Non-200 responses to proxy CONNECT requests lead to attacks on HTTPS") works: I can cause the browser to display an error message instead of allowing the exploit by checking for SSLConnectFailed() early in HttpChannel::ProcessResponse().
But I'm not sure on some important details that we'd need to sort out before we can fix this:
1) What \*exactly\* is the behavior we want to have when we encounter this? Adam suggests treating this as a "network error" for non-200 responses in [comment #2](/show_bug.cgi?id=479880#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Non-200 responses to proxy CONNECT requests lead to attacks on HTTPS"). Waldo suggests we barf on \*all\* requests by putting the check early on in the function. My hunch is that if SSLConnectFail has been called, we probably want to treat it as an error, regardless of HTTP response code--but I don't know HTTPS proxy/client protocols very well.
2) Assuming Waldo is correct, how early exactly do we want to do this check, and what's the right behavior? In my patch I've called Cancel() and returned with NS\_ERROR\_NET\_RESET (the closest thing I could find in netwerk/base/public/nsNetError.h to a "network error"). I've done this early enough that if we encounter this failure, we don't notify the ""http-on-examine-response" observers, or set cookies, etc. But I don't know this code at all, so I'm merely guessing that this is correct.
Can anyone point me at a spec for HTTPS proxying?

I think we want to block all status codes except 407, which is "Proxy Authentication Required". It's essential that we not read unauthenticated bytes from the message payload, even on a 407, but we do want to get far enough in the proxy auth process to show the user the auth challenge dialog.

Jason,
HTTPS proxy tunneling is originally specified in an expired
Internet-Draft titled "Tunneling TCP based protocols through
Web proxy servers". You can find the Internet-Draft by doing
a Web search for that title.
It is also specified in Section 5 (specifically Sections 5.2
and 5.3) of RFC 2817.

On the patch, I guess you want the mConnectionInfo->UsingSSL() guard that's in the current codepath that hits the SSL-failed check, but I haven't looked to see what the consequences are.
(In reply to [comment #7](/show_bug.cgi?id=479880#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - Non-200 responses to proxy CONNECT requests lead to attacks on HTTPS"))

> early on in the function.
To be clear, my suggestion was off-the-cuff and mostly motivated by the existing code structure and by a desire to fail generally rather than only in specific cases (potentially missing some along the way). I wasn't thinking much about the "right" response or what it should be so much as about ensuring a forceful abort of normal handling in all cases outside the clearly-correct ones. Putting up the proxy-auth dialogs for the 407 case and only using the response data in the 200 case where the handshake must succeed for the data to be used seems most correct on further thought. (The RFC says any 2xx response, but what would a 206 response to a CONNECT request even mean? We'll need to test 200, 203, 206, and at least one other 2xx response here to verify correct behavior in all cases, at least if the current code setup isn't substantially changed.)

I was going to say treat them the same as some typical HTTPS error, maybe untrusted sender, but then the user can click through -- and given that one hopes non-malicious instances of this in the real world are rare, it would be better not to give users the gun in the first place.

NS\_ERROR\_PROXY\_CONNECTION\_REFUSED ("The connection attempt to a proxy failed", so the name is a slight misnomer for the description) seems better here (we'd treat responses as though the proxy gave a malformed response), and I'm pretty sure that wouldn't allow a way to click through the error page.

Seems right, biesi may know more.

are about the closest I could find when I was looking at this in connection with [bug 428009](/show_bug.cgi?id=428009 "RESOLVED FIXED - hook up ssltunnel to mochitest") (they seem to be what [comment 9](/show_bug.cgi?id=479880#c9 "RESOLVED FIXED - Non-200 responses to proxy CONNECT requests lead to attacks on HTTPS") was suggesting). The RFCs for this aren't organized very coherently or discoverably as far as I can tell, unfortunately.

It won't. The overrides on cert errors are specific to a small set, and that's not one of them, so unless it was added explicitly, it gets a full stop.
Having said that - whatever expedient solution we use for branches that are string frozen, it feels to me like the best thing to do for upcoming versions is just to introduce a new error, and strings, for this case. Hopefully we haven't used up all our error codes?
I'd be happy to recommend strings for a mozilla-central patch, if you agree.

Oh, right, too much in the mindset of not being able to change these things...new error is best for trunk, for sure.

Sounds good -- although of course we can hack in bogo-strings in the meantime, until final UI becomes the only holdup here.

Re: 2xx responses to CONNECT requests: I don't know what
a non-200 2xx response to CONNECT means either. So in
Chromium's network stack, I only consider a 200 response
as successful tunnel setup, and I disallow any response
body after the response headers. So far I haven't received
any bug report that this is overly strict.
Please remember to test the URL
<https://no.such.host/>
against a proxy. This will give you a vivid idea what we
lose by handling any non-200 non-407 response as a network
error. For example, the proxy I use returns a 404 response
whose body contains an informative error message:
While trying to retrieve the URL: no.such.host:443
The following error was encountered:
Unable to determine IP address from host name for
The dnsserver returned:
Name Error: The domain name does not exist.
This means that:
The cache was not able to resolve the hostname
presented in the URL. Check if the address is
correct.
In our testing we have seen our proxy return 403, 404,
and 501 with a useful error page in the response body.
It's too bad that we won't be able to display this error
page to users for security reasons.

We could potentially show some built in error pages to differentiate the different status codes. In principle, we could use heuristics (like greping the error pages) to figure out if its some common error like "host not found."

Attached patch

[Possibly correct patch](attachment.cgi?id=371776&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=371776&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=479880&attachment=371776)

OK, so it looks to me like the existing strategy should work fine: by the time we get to the code in the patch we will have set SSLConnectFailed in OnHeadersAvailable() iff we do an SSL proxy connect and the status != 200. So we can and should bail out here if SSLConnectFailed is true. The only exception I've heard are 407 requests, which we let drop through.
I don't know the code well enough to say if my method of "bailing out" is the right one. I'm going to have biesi take a look, as he'll know.
The last remaining issue is the error code to use for branches and the trunk. It sounds like we want a new error code for the trunk; anyone have a suggestion? For now I've stuck in NS\_ERROR\_PROXY\_CONNECTION\_REFUSED.

You can't just let 407 through. You have to make sure we don't render the entity body, even if the user cancels the auth request, etc.

So, the more I think about this, isn't a more global solution to allow the browser to treat 403/404/407/501 responses with failed SSL "normally" (i.e. render content), but just not as if the HTML were coming from the final destination (i.e paypal)?
I don't know this code base very well yet, but surely we've got some way to let the code upstream know that the content is coming from the proxy server (or from some dummy "unsafe" URL that can't have cookies, etc.), and not the final site. Anyone know of the correct frob for this?

Jason,
Your proposal would be the ideal solution, but it may
requires a lot of work to get it right. (In fact,
that's what I asked Adam to do originally.)
The solution Adam and I suggested is a drastic measure,
but it is much simpler to get right and be secure. If
you decide to proceed with this solution, make sure you
set up a proxy that requires HTTP authentication, visit
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/>, and cancel the proxy's
auth dialog. The proxy's 407 response should not be
displayed. I have such a proxy at work, so I can perform
this test for you.

Right, the URL bar would still have the URI the user typed in,

I think for the phishing situation that's really not sufficient, esp for the security-conscious user who clicks a bookmark they know points to https... they might not even notice the lack of other indicators, since they "know" their setup is "correct" in terms of not being phishable without screaming in your face warnings about cert mismatches.

[test case: 407 reply from evil proxy (reads target site cookie). Run with "nc -l 8080 < evil\_407\_SSL\_proxy.reply"](attachment.cgi?id=371987)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=371987&action=edit)

I've attached a test case that verifies that if we let 407 requests through without further code changes (i.e. if we use the 371776 patch), we are vulnerable to the same cookie/etc attack, as the proxy server's "auth failed" page is treated by Firefox as if it came from paypal.com.
I think we really want to keep these proxy server msgs if we can, so we should try to find a way to display them w/o treating them as from the target destination.

[Bug 488386](/show_bug.cgi?id=488386 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - SSL MiTM on Firefox while using a Proxy by doing Hi-Jacking the Proxy") is a dup (I didn't mark it as such, will leave to a more seasoned hand to do that); this problem seems to be accumulating attention, although it could just be a complete coincidence. Worth ramping up the pace here since it's something other people are stumbling on?

Attached patch

[Partial patch for fix](attachment.cgi?id=372752&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=372752&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=479880&attachment=372752)

I've got half a fix here (I'm still tracking down the correct way to handle 407 responses). But since there's some UI-ish decisions here, and I want to try to get this into 3.5b4 in the next day or two, I thought I'd run what I've got by you all.
So we're basically in the game here of trying to match up HTTP response codes from the proxy to the most helpful boilerplate Mozilla error page available. I've poked around a bit at squid's code, to see how it works, and RFC 2616, and the logic in the patch is what seems the most sensible to me. There are a couple of codes where I had to make a choice (500 as DNS failure vs. as internal server error; 504 as DNS vs target failure), and I'm also guessing at what to do for 501 (Wan-Teh, you said you were seeing meaningful pages from proxies with 501: what kind of message?).
There's also the question of what the default page should be for other error codes. There's really nothing else I can see that's a valid response from a proxy, so I shoveled in NS\_ERROR\_UNSAFE\_CONTENT\_TYPE to give the user an "unsafe content" message, to indicate someone may be messing with them. I am not at all certain that's the best UI choice.
So: take a look at the patch, and any comments or opinions would be welcome.

OK, I think I've figured out how to handle the 407 case, too (it's fairly simple), so this patch is ready for review.
Please see notes to previous patch, all of which are still valid issues/questions.
I've verified that this code works both with the 407 test case attached to this bug (which doesn't pop up an auth window, as it lacks the correct headers), and with squid, which does pop up an auth window. We need to handle both cases, of course...Assignee: nobody → jduell.mcbugs

Patch now handles all cases: needs review
I don't know the netwerk code that well, so my review isn't
authoritative. Just trying to help...
Assuming that nsHttpChannel::ProcessResponse is the right place
to handle SSL proxy connection failures, your patch looks correct.
I have three nits.
1. I don't know what "fsck" means.
2. Add a "break" statement to the 'default' case in the
switch statement you added.
3. In this LOG statement, you are missing the corresponding format
specifiers for 'this' and 'httpStatus':
>+ LOG(("Cancelling failed SSL proxy connection\n", this, httpStatus));
Compare that with this LOG statement, which has the format specifiers:
> LOG(("nsHttpChannel::ProcessResponse [this=%x httpStatus=%u]\n",
> this, httpStatus));

OK, I've incorporated Wan-Teh's suggestions,
I've also changed the default response (for HTTP codes that don't make sense) to "Proxy server refused connection" (the last patch returned NS\_ERROR\_UNSAFE\_CONTENT\_TYPE, which gave a page about the "file type being unsafe", which I now think is likely to just confuse people).
Wan-Teh, could you tell me what sort of error page you've gotten from a proxy with a 501 status, as you mentioned in [comment #13](/show_bug.cgi?id=479880#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Non-200 responses to proxy CONNECT requests lead to attacks on HTTPS")? Thanks.

I think I would have expected 500 to go up above, with "Proxy Refused Connection". If a proxy is 500'ng, whether it's a DNS thing or not on the proxy's end, I think it's probably more helpful to the user to say "The proxy doesn't like you. Take it up with your proxy admin." than to say "Maybe you typed in the address wrong."
Without the RFC reference, I would have assumed the same about 400, tbh. With it there though, no really committed either way.

This message will be a little confusing, but in a scary way so it's probably the best play given that we can't change strings.
This is an improvement over the current state of affairs, so modulo getting your opinion on 500 above, and filing a follow-up to do this with proper strings on trunk, ui-r=me

Yeah, I'm basing the treatment of 400 & 500 purely based on the comment in RFC 2616, and who knows if the "already deployed proxies" are still around 10 years later. That said, squid is using 404 for DNS failure, which is at least as dumb as 400/500. I really don't have a strong sense of what to do here, but at least 400/500 errors should be fairly infrequent.
>+ // Assume we're being fsck'd with, and give message about scary content.
>+ default:
>+ rv = NS\_ERROR\_UNSAFE\_CONTENT\_TYPE;
So note that I've changed this in the latest patch to NS\_ERROR\_PROXY\_CONNECTION\_REFUSED. See my reasoning above. Somehow blaming things on an "unsafe file type" seems likely to confuse people, so just a regular "proxy refused" error seems better to me.
> filing a follow-up to do this with proper strings on trunk

If we weren't in a string freeze, I think the way we would have dealt with this would have been to create some new errors, and strings for the error page, instead of recycling existing mostly-similar errors, no?

I suppose it is worth a look over the exact error text to see if we want to change the text. But they would only need to be fairly minor changes, i.e. instead of "firefox can't find the server at www.foo.com", "your proxy server can't find ...", etc.
But it's probably worth doing. As long as I don't have to be the one who comes up with the actual text :)

Jason, we have seen the following response codes from proxies:
403: Squid seems to only allow SSL tunnels to certain ports.
If I visit <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org:80/>, Squid responds
with a 403 error page:
ERROR
The requested URL could not be retrieved
While trying to retrieve the URL: bugzilla.mozilla.org:80
The following error was encountered:
\* Access Denied.
Access control configuration prevents your request
from being allowed at this time. Please contact
your service provider if you feel this is incorrect.
404: Squid returns 404 for host not found. Test case is
<https://no.such.host/>
501: An internal proxy we use for testing purposes doesn't
support HTTPS, so it responds with 501 (not implemented)
to tunnel CONNECT requests. Although this proxy is not
generally available, its use of 501 in this case seems
reasonable.

OK, I think the current patch covers Wan-Teh's cases appropriately. Getting "proxy refused" from a server that doesn't implement SSL tunneling is close enough, in my opinion--there's no other string-frozen message that we've got that's any better.

501 is explicitly sanctioned for this purpose in RFC 2616 section 5.1.1:
An origin server SHOULD return the status code [...] 501
(Not Implemented) if the method is unrecognized or not
implemented by the origin server.

Returning back to my first note in [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=479880#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - Non-200 responses to proxy CONNECT requests lead to attacks on HTTPS"), expand this into:

as a sanity check -- inspection shows the guard isn't necessary, but if we're going to rely on the invariant we should enforce it in debug builds to be safe.
Looks good with that change.

ProcessFailedSSLConnect is called in two places, and should only ever be called if SSL is being used, so I put the UsingSSL() check at the top of the function.
Skipping UI review, since that hasn't changed from the last patch.

Not right away. Waldo tells me we'll need some httpd.js changes to support
testing this. And it'll be a lot of work to test a fairly simple patch.

Testing this with the two manual tests, the behavior looks fixed with the original test but I notice no difference in behavior with the second test between 1.9.0.9 and 1.9.0.10. They act in the same manner (both getting a prompt for a username and password).
This was tested on OS X 10.5.6 with Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042315 Firefox/3.0.10.

Al: for the second test, you need to cancel the username/password
prompt and see what happens. With the fix, you should not see an
error page from the proxy server.

We've got a bug that seems likely to be a result of this fix:
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=491818](/show_bug.cgi?id=491818 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - FF does not follow browser redirection to Proxy Login page")
They've got a setup where their proxy redirects unauthorized users to a login page (rather than using the std 407 auth prompt).
The issue: do we have a way to honor a redirect without parsing any page content that the redirect contains? That's what we need in order to make this style of redirect work w/o opening back up the security hole.Status: RESOLVED → REOPENEDResolution: FIXED → ---

Is this behavior Firefox specific?
When testing with 1.8.1 Seamonkey, I see no difference between last night's build and the last shipped Seamonkey (1.1.16). In both instances, the alert, which contains cookie information when this is unpatched, is empty.
Unfortunately, I just checked this in Firefox 3.0.10 and 3.0.11 again on OS X and, for some reason, the 3.0.11 build 2 is exhibiting the bug. With both of the testcases here, the alert is showing cookie information.
I went back to the May 11 build that I verified with (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11pre) Gecko/2009051104 GranParadiso/3.0.11pre) and it \*is\* fixed there. Something reverted the fix.
I'm not sure if something somehow reverted or

When I check in any 1.9.0 nightly from 5/11 through 6/4, the bug IS fixed.
When I check in Firefox 3.0.10 release and 3.0.11 build 2 (the current build), the cookie information is shown in the alerts.
I'm utterly baffled here.

You're testing with HTTP, but this fix is only for HTTPS :) Also note that the correct behavior is to see NO alert, so even seeing an empty alert is a test failure.
I just tested the 3.0.10 release (OSX) and the 3.0.11 build 2 for OSX from here
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/3.0.11-candidates/build2/
It works fine, i.e. I get the boilerplate "proxy refused" page, with no
alert popup of any kind.

For the record - [CVE-2009-2061](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2061) was assigned to the redirect / III.B attack described in the paper:
Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.10 processes a 3xx HTTP CONNECT response
before a successful SSL handshake, which allows man-in-the-middle
attackers to execute arbitrary web script, in an https site's context,
by modifying this CONNECT response to specify a 302 redirect to an
arbitrary https web site.
Also [CVE-2009-2065](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2065) for III.C (is there a separate bug for that)?

Sorry for the late response, but I wasn't aware of this discussion before today.
This change will cause major headache for users behind proxies and the administators of those proxies. The proxy error messages often do contain important information the user is supposed to see. Replacing these messages with general boilerplate messages is not a good idea. We have already seen this with MSIE for a long time (all protocols) and it's a very frequent problem cause from a usability perspective.
Error messages from proxies is not only the dull standard technical messages which has been partially quoted here, but also notifications when the user accesses content he is not allowed to access, terms of use etc.
And even for the technical error messages such as "connection failed" "host not found" etc the error message as such is important in tracking down the error cause. Doing a string search to identify these will not work out well as the error messages is often localized or even replaced entirely with custom site-specific messages.
But I do understand the very valid concerns about phising. I have however a proposal along the lines of Jason comment earlier.
\* Before rendering the response, pop up an error notification dialog, similar to the certificate error dialog, requiring user action before showing the content.
\* When rendering the content, make sure to render the content in a different context blocking any access to cookies etc. I.e. render the content with a different internal requested-URI.
\* When following any links from this content, DON'T use the originilal requested-URI in Referer. Using the internally generated dummy URI mentioned above is fine (assuming it does not contain user specific details), or none at all.
\* Try to block any active content / plugins from being used in rendering the response.
Regarding 407 responses the auth dialog needs to be handled as usual, even for NTLM/Negotiate authentication. Which means the connection as such isn't considered broken. If the user cancels the auth dialog to render the error message then start at the top of the list above.

I strongly agree. It is not resolved nor fixed in its current state.
I have a proxy that provides detailed certificate status information in error messages and now Firefox just drops it completely.

It looks to me like this CVE is fixed by this bug. Shouldn't the CVE be updated ?

I realize that I'm way late to the party here, but I want to echo what Henrik and Alex said - this fix is terrible for proxy admins (myself included). Our proxy returns a 403 forbidden for filtered SSL content and an error page about why the content is blocked, and Firefox just drops all of it on the floor. :(

To fix the unfortunate situation this bug created for proxy and captive portals users, Firefox should ad handling of
HTTP error 511 Network Authentication Required
as soon as possible
(see [bug #728658](/show_bug.cgi?id=728658 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Handle HTTP error 511 Network Authentication Required (RFC 6585: standard secure proxy authentification/captive portal detection)"))
You need to [log in](/show_bug.cgi?id=479880&GoAheadAndLogIn=1)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=503578#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-06-01 18:58:03 UTC  ``` Microsoft security researchers Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang, and Ming Zhang reported that when a CONNECT request is sent to a proxy server and a non-200 response is returned, then the body of the response is incorrectly rendered within the context of the request Host: header. An active network attacker could use this vulnerability to intercept a CONNECT request and reply with a non-200 response containing malicious code which would be executed within the context of the victim's requested SSL-protected domain. Since this attack requires the victim to have a proxy configured, the severity of this issue was determined to be high.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=503578#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 22:46:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1095.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=503578#c3)  Fedora Update System    2009-06-16 02:18:00 UTC  ``` firefox-3.0.11-1.fc10, xulrunner-1.9.0.11-1.fc10, epiphany-2.24.3-7.fc10, epiphany-extensions-2.24.3-2.fc10, blam-1.8.5-11.fc10, devhelp-0.22-9.fc10, galeon-2.0.7-11.fc10, gecko-sharp2-0.13-9.fc10, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-31.fc10, gnome-web-photo-0.3-19.fc10, google-gadgets-0.10.5-7.fc10, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc10.3, Miro-2.0.3-5.fc10, mozvoikko-0.9.5-11.fc10, mugshot-1.2.2-10.fc10, pcmanx-gtk2-0.3.8-10.fc10, perl-Gtk2-MozEmbed-0.08-6.fc10.2, ruby-gnome2-0.18.1-5.fc10.3, yelp-2.24.0-10.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-0lenny1.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported mail client.

For the testing (squeeze) distribution these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) -

## Details

Several flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine of Thunderbird. If a

user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into viewing malicious web

content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-1303](/security/CVE-2009-1303), [CVE-2009-1305](/security/CVE-2009-1305), [CVE-2009-1392](/security/CVE-2009-1392), [CVE-2009-1833](/security/CVE-2009-1833),

[CVE-2009-1838](/security/CVE-2009-1838))

Several flaws were discovered in the way Thunderbird processed malformed

URI schemes. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website and

had JavaScript and plugins enabled, a remote attacker could execute

arbitrary JavaScript or steal private data. ([CVE-2009-1306](/security/CVE-2009-1306), [CVE-2009-1307](/security/CVE-2009-1307),

[CVE-2009-1309](/security/CVE-2009-1309))

Cefn Hoile discovered Thunderbird did not adequately protect against

embedded third-party stylesheets. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker

could exploit this to perform script injection attacks using XBL bindings.

([CVE-2009-1308](/security/CVE-2009-1308))

Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang, and Ming Zhang discovered that

Thunderbird did not properly handle error responses when connecting to a

proxy server. If a user had JavaScript enabled while using Thunderbird to

view websites and a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive

information. ([CVE-2009-1836](/security/CVE-2009-1836))

It was discovered that Thunderbird could be made to run scripts with

elevated privileges. If a user had JavaScript enabled while having

certain non-default add-ons installed and were tricked into viewing a

malicious website, an attacker could cause a chrome privileged object, such

as the browser sidebar, to run arbitrary code via interactions with the

attacker controlled website. ([CVE-2009-1841](/security/CVE-2009-1841))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=503579#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-06-01 19:01:53 UTC  ``` Jakob Balle and Carsten Eiram of Secunia Research reported a race condition in NPObjWrapper_NewResolve when accessing the properties of a NPObject, a wrapped JSObject. Balle and Eiram demonstrated that this condition could be reached by navigating away from a web page during the loading of a Java applet. Under such conditions the Java object would be destroyed but later called into resulting in a free memory read. An attacker could potentially write to the freed memory before it is reused and run arbitrary code on the victim's computer.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=503579#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 22:46:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1095.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=503579#c3)  Fedora Update System    2009-06-16 02:18:05 UTC  ``` firefox-3.0.11-1.fc10, xulrunner-1.9.0.11-1.fc10, epiphany-2.24.3-7.fc10, epiphany-extensions-2.24.3-2.fc10, blam-1.8.5-11.fc10, devhelp-0.22-9.fc10, galeon-2.0.7-11.fc10, gecko-sharp2-0.13-9.fc10, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-31.fc10, gnome-web-photo-0.3-19.fc10, google-gadgets-0.10.5-7.fc10, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc10.3, Miro-2.0.3-5.fc10, mozvoikko-0.9.5-11.fc10, mugshot-1.2.2-10.fc10, pcmanx-gtk2-0.3.8-10.fc10, perl-Gtk2-MozEmbed-0.08-6.fc10.2, ruby-gnome2-0.18.1-5.fc10.3, yelp-2.24.0-10.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.
