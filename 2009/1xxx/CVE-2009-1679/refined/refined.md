Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1679:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in how configuration profiles are handled within the iOS operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness is that a configuration profile can overwrite the existing passcode policy set by Exchange ActiveSync, potentially weakening security controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker with physical access to the device could bypass the passcode policy enforced by Exchange ActiveSync. This could lead to unauthorized access to the device and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves installing a malicious or specially crafted configuration profile on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires physical access to the iOS device and the ability to install a configuration profile, meaning they need some level of access to the device settings. The attacker needs a configuration profile with a weaker passcode policy than the existing one enforced by Exchange ActiveSync.
