Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1909:

**Summary:**
CVE-2009-1909 is a SQL Injection vulnerability found in SKIP, an open-source Social Networking Service (SNS) software. This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially alter data or gain access to sensitive information within the application's database.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate and escape input parameters before embedding them into SQL statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89). This occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious SQL code into an application's SQL queries through user-controlled inputs.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application does not adequately sanitize user inputs, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:** It is implied that the application does not use parameterized queries or prepared statements, which could prevent SQL injection by separating the SQL code from user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify data stored within the SKIP application's database.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database.
*   **Potential Further Attacks:** In some scenarios, attackers can leverage successful SQL injection to escalate their attack, possibly gaining more access to the underlying system, or compromising other parts of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The most likely attack vector is through the application's web interface.
*   **User Input:** The vulnerability is triggered through manipulation of user-supplied data that's used in database queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:**  An attacker would need to be a registered user of the SKIP application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** An attacker would need knowledge of SQL Injection and how to inject malicious code.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** SKIP versions 1.0.2 and earlier, as well as 1.1RC2 and earlier are affected.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as having a CVSS v2 base score of 6.5, indicating a medium severity, though other sources classify access required as high and user interaction required as high. 
*   **Exploitation Complexity:** The exploit complexity is rated as low-medium, suggesting some technical expertise may be required, but that the vulnerability is not exceptionally hard to exploit.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Parameterized Queries or Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user input.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Employ techniques like whitelisting allowed characters and escaping special characters.
*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure database accounts used by the application have the minimal required privileges to limit the impact of a successful SQL injection.

**CWE classification**
* CWE-89 is identified as the weakness related to SQL Injection.
* The content also mentions the relationship to other CWEs and OWASP categories like CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), CWE-77 (Command Injection), OWASP Top Ten categories for Injection Flaws and Unvalidated Input, and categories related to insecure interactions between components.
