Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in moziloCMS 1.11:

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user input, specifically the `page` parameter, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input validation, path traversal vulnerability.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted URL with a `page` parameter containing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`).
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, database credentials, or even source code.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user input in the `query` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient output encoding, lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted URL with the `query` parameter containing JavaScript code.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing other actions on behalf of the user.
*  **Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application leaks the full path of the server in certain URLs.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Error messages or responses that reveal server-side file paths.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By sending requests with specific parameters (e.g., `gal[]`, `page[]`, `file[]`), the application reveals file paths.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application.
    *   **Impact:** Path disclosure can help attackers gain information about the server's file structure, potentially aiding further attacks.

**Exploitation:**

*   The exploit examples (PoCs) provided in the content demonstrate how these vulnerabilities can be exploited.
*   For LFI, the attacker uses path traversal sequences in the `page` parameter along with null byte injection (`%00`) to bypass file inclusion restrictions.
*   For XSS, the attacker injects JavaScript code in the `query` parameter.
*   For path disclosure, the attacker uses specific parameters to reveal server paths.

The provided information gives more detail than the official CVE description, by providing specific attack vectors (URLs with crafted parameters) and specific file locations that can be accessed using LFI, while the CVE description just states "multiple vulnerabilities".
