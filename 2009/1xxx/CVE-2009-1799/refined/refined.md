Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `getGalleryImage` function within the `example.php` and `gallery_output.php` files. The function directly incorporates user-supplied GET parameters (`gallery_category` and `gallery_show`) into SQL queries without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `gallery_category` and `gallery_show` parameters, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the queries, enabling them to extract sensitive data, modify data, or even execute operating system commands.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database, potentially leading to data corruption or loss.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability along with the `INTO OUTFILE` MySQL functionality (if file creation permissions allow), an attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameters:** The attack vector is through the `gallery_category` and `gallery_show` GET parameters in the `example.php` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
-  `magic_quotes_gpc` needs to be off.
- For the shell upload exploit, file creation permissions are required on the server.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippets are:

```php
// In example.php and st_admin/gallery_output.php
if($_GET[gallery_category]){
	getGalleryImage($_GET[gallery_category], $_GET[gallery_show], true, "both", 450, "");
}

function getGalleryImage($album, $image, $showAlbum, $posNav, $maxWidth){
if($showAlbum){
	$abfrage = "SELECT * FROM ".$db_prefix."gallery_category WHERE id = '$album'";
	$ergebnis = mysql_query($abfrage);
}
$abfrage = "SELECT * FROM ".$db_prefix."gallery_images WHERE category = '$album'";
$ergebnis = mysql_query($abfrage);
```

The attacker can inject SQL code via the `$album` variable (passed as `$_GET[gallery_category]`) due to the direct inclusion of the unsanitized variable into the SQL query.
The provided proof of concepts (PoC) and exploits demonstrate how an attacker can inject SQL queries to retrieve database version information, extract data from other tables, and upload a shell using `INTO OUTFILE`.
