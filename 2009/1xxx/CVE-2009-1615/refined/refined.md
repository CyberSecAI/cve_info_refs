Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Leap CMS 0.1.4:

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application directly uses user-supplied input (`$_POST['email']` and `$_POST['pwd']`) within an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This is in the `checkSession()` function of `leap.php`.
    *   **Weakness:**  The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization when querying the database for user authentication. Specifically, the session variables `$_SESSION['userMail']` and `$_SESSION['passWord']` are directly inserted into the SQL query.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can manipulate the `email` and `pwd` POST parameters to inject malicious SQL code. The exploit uses `email: nothing' or 1=1#` to bypass authentication, by injecting a condition that is always true, bypassing the intended query logic
    *  **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the login form. The `magic_quotes_gpc` setting needs to be off

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Cookie Stealing:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when comments are created.
    *  **Weakness:** The code is vulnerable to XSS due to the lack of input sanitization when rendering comments.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can insert malicious JavaScript code within the comment section. The provided exploit includes a script tag that redirects the user to a malicious site with their cookie.
    *   **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to comment on an article and have a user view the comment.

*   **Arbitrary File Upload (Shell Upload):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The file management functionality in the admin panel allows super administrators to upload arbitrary files without proper validation.
    *   **Weakness:** The application lacks validation or restriction on uploaded files in the admin panel, allowing for arbitrary file uploads.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with super administrator privileges can upload a malicious PHP script (shell) through the "Manage Files" option and then execute it by navigating to the file URL.
    *  **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have super administrator access, which can be achieved through the SQL injection vulnerability.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Search Form:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The search functionality doesn't sanitize the input leading to XSS
    *   **Weakness:** The code is vulnerable to XSS due to the lack of input sanitization when rendering search results.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can inject malicious Javascript code in the search form and trigger the XSS
    *  **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the search form and trigger the XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   Complete authentication bypass
    *  Potential for complete database access, leading to data exfiltration or manipulation.
*   **XSS (Cookie Stealing):**
    *   Session hijacking, enabling the attacker to impersonate users.
    *   Potentially redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:**
    *   Remote code execution on the server.
    *   Complete control of the server hosting the application.
*   **XSS (Search Form):**
    *  Execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable application

**Summary:**

The provided information details multiple vulnerabilities in Leap CMS 0.1.4, including SQL injection, multiple XSS vulnerabilities, and arbitrary file upload.  The combined impact of these vulnerabilities is severe, allowing an attacker to gain complete control of the application and the server it's hosted on. This is more detailed than a typical CVE description.
