Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-1584:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities in TemaTres 1.0.3 is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation, making it susceptible to SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass (SQL Injection):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the login form, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication using crafted SQL queries.
    *   **Technical Detail**: By injecting `' or 1=1 /*` into the mail or password field, an attacker can bypass the authentication check.
2.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in different parts of the application, allowing attackers to extract sensitive data, such as user credentials.
    *   **Technical Detail:**
        *   Unregistered users are vulnerable via the `letra` GET parameter. The example given in the exploit allows for retrieval of a user's email and password.
        *   Registered users are vulnerable via the `m` and `y` GET parameters in `sobre.php`, allowing the retrieval of user credentials and database information.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:**
        *   **Vulnerability:** The application is also vulnerable to Blind SQL injection through the `xml.php` file and its parameters: `dcTema`, `madsTema`, `zthesTema`, `skosTema`, and `xtmTema`. This allows attackers to infer information about the database.
        *   **Technical Detail:** An attacker can use boolean-based blind SQL injection to extract data, character by character by injecting conditional statements such as `' AND 1=0/*` or `' AND 1=1/*` in those parameters. A perl script is provided as an example of an automated way to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability.
3.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to XSS, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages.
    *   **Technical Detail:** Various input fields and URL parameters are vulnerable to XSS. The provided examples demonstrate how to inject `<script>` tags into search forms, URL parameters and other locations, affecting both registered and unregistered users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the application, potentially with administrative privileges.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials (email and unencrypted passwords), potentially leading to identity theft and further unauthorized access.
*   **Malicious Script Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into pages viewed by other users, leading to defacement, redirection, and further compromise of user accounts or systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** Exploiting the login form with manipulated input.
*   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting vulnerable GET parameters in various application pages like `index.php`, `sobre.php`, and `xml.php`.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** Injecting malicious scripts into form fields and URL parameters that are reflected back to the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** To perform SQL Injection attacks.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTML/JavaScript:** To perform XSS attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploits indicate that `gpc_magic_quotes` must be off for the SQL injection attacks to be successful.
*   The passwords in the database are not encrypted.
*   The provided exploit script automates the blind SQL injection process to extract usernames and passwords.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered and reported on 2009-04-23/24 and fixed on 2009-05-04 with patch version 1.0.31.
