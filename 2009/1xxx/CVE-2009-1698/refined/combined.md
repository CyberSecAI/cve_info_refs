How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

It was discovered that QtWebKit did not properly handle certain SVGPathList

data structures. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website,

an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0945](/security/CVE-2009-0945))

Several flaws were discovered in the QtWebKit browser and JavaScript

engines. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote

attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1687](/security/CVE-2009-1687),

[CVE-2009-1690](/security/CVE-2009-1690), [CVE-2009-1698](/security/CVE-2009-1698), [CVE-2009-1711](/security/CVE-2009-1711), [CVE-2009-1725](/security/CVE-2009-1725))

It was discovered that QtWebKit did not properly handle certain XSL

stylesheets. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website,

an attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary local files, and possibly

files from different security zones. ([CVE-2009-1699](/security/CVE-2009-1699), [CVE-2009-1713](/security/CVE-2009-1713))

It was discovered that QtWebKit did not prevent the loading of local Java

applets. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, an

attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1712](/security/CVE-2009-1712))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [kde4libs](/security/cves?package=kde4libs) -
* [kdelibs](/security/cves?package=kdelibs) -

## Details

It was discovered that KDE-Libs did not properly handle certain malformed

SVG images. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted SVG

image, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-0945](/security/CVE-2009-0945))

It was discovered that the KDE JavaScript garbage collector did not

properly handle memory allocation failures. If a user were tricked into

viewing a malicious website, an attacker could cause a denial of service or

possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2009-1687](/security/CVE-2009-1687))

It was discovered that KDE-Libs did not properly handle HTML content in the

head element. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, an

attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1690](/security/CVE-2009-1690))

It was discovered that KDE-Libs did not properly handle the Cascading Style

Sheets (CSS) attr function call. If a user were tricked into viewing a

malicious website, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. ([CVE-2009-1698](/security/CVE-2009-1698))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Bug     : 532724 532725 534946 535793 538346

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in webkit, a Web content engine
library for Gtk+. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-0945

Array index error in the insertItemBefore method in WebKit, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a document with a SVGPathList data
structure containing a negative index in the SVGTransformList, SVGStringList,
SVGNumberList, SVGPathSegList, SVGPointList, or SVGLengthList SVGList object,
which triggers memory corruption.

CVE-2009-1687

The JavaScript garbage collector in WebKit does not properly handle allocation
failures, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a
denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML
document that triggers write access to an "offset of a NULL pointer."

CVE-2009-1690

Use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application
crash) by setting an unspecified property of an HTML tag that causes child
elements to be freed and later accessed when an HTML error occurs, related to
"recursion in certain DOM event handlers."

CVE-2009-1698

WebKit does not initialize a pointer during handling of a Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS) attr function call with a large numerical argument, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory
corruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML document.

CVE-2009-1711

WebKit does not properly initialize memory for Attr DOM objects, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(application crash) via a crafted HTML document.

CVE-2009-1712

WebKit does not prevent remote loading of local Java applets, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, gain privileges, or obtain sensitive
information via an APPLET or OBJECT element.

CVE-2009-1725

WebKit do not properly handle numeric character references, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory
corruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML document.

CVE-2009-1714

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Web Inspector in WebKit allows
user-assisted remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML, and read
local files, via vectors related to the improper escaping of HTML attributes.

CVE-2009-1710

WebKit allows remote attackers to spoof the browser's display of the host name,
security indicators, and unspecified other UI elements via a custom cursor in
conjunction with a modified CSS3 hotspot property.

CVE-2009-1697

CRLF injection vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to inject HTTP
headers and bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted HTML document, related
to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that depend on communication with
arbitrary web sites on the same server through use of XMLHttpRequest without a
Host header.

CVE-2009-1695

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving access to frame
contents after completion of a page transition.

CVE-2009-1693

WebKit allows remote attackers to read images from arbitrary web sites via a
CANVAS element with an SVG image, related to a "cross-site image capture issue."

CVE-2009-1694

WebKit does not properly handle redirects, which allows remote attackers to read
images from arbitrary web sites via vectors involving a CANVAS element and
redirection, related to a "cross-site image capture issue."

CVE-2009-1681

WebKit does not prevent web sites from loading third-party content into a
subframe, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and
conduct "clickjacking" attacks via a crafted HTML document.

CVE-2009-1684

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via an event handler that triggers script
execution in the context of the next loaded document.

CVE-2009-1692

WebKit allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption
or device reset) via a web page containing an HTMLSelectElement object with a
large length attribute, related to the length property of a Select object.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-4+lenny2.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.1.16-1.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
