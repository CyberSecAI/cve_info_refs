    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1743",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_c85ec96f_20250125_102918.html",
      "root_cause": "The Pinnacle Studio 12 software processes .hfz files by extracting them to a user-defined location. The software does not validate the paths specified within the .hfz archive, allowing a malicious user to create a specially crafted .hfz file that contains directory traversal sequences.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Directory Traversal vulnerability in the handling of .hfz files."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the target system or place malicious scripts in startup folders, leading to arbitrary code execution when the user logs on.",
      "attack_vectors": "A local user can create a specially crafted .hfz file and convince a victim to open it with Pinnacle Studio. When opened, the malicious .hfz file will overwrite files on the system due to directory traversal. The InstallHFX.exe decompresses the file without prompts.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious .hfz file and have the target user open it with Pinnacle Studio. The attacker requires local access or the ability to deliver the malicious file to the target system."
