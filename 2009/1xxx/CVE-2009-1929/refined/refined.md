**Summary:**
The provided content primarily discusses CVE-2009-1929, a remote code execution vulnerability in the Microsoft Terminal Services Client ActiveX control. It also mentions CVE-2009-1133, another vulnerability affecting the Remote Desktop Connection client.

**CVE-2009-1929:**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient parameter validation in the Remote Desktop Web Connection ActiveX control methods leads to a heap overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Heap overflow.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system, potentially gaining complete control of the affected system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability, and convince users to visit the malicious page via a link, potentially through email or instant messages, or through banner advertisements.
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited on systems used to connect to Web-based Terminal Services.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and convince the victim to visit it. The victim needs to have the vulnerable ActiveX control installed and active, for example, by using a client to connect to Web-based terminal servers.

**CVE-2009-1133 (Related):**

*   **Root Cause:**  Improper processing of specific parameters returned by the RDP server leading to a heap overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Heap overflow in the processing of RDP server parameters.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain the same user rights as the local user and take complete control of the affected system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious RDP server:** An attacker could convince a user to connect to a malicious RDP server.
    *   **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted Web site that uses the RDP ActiveX control to connect the session to a malicious RDP server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to either control a malicious RDP server or be able to host a malicious webpage and convince the victim to visit it or connect to the attacker controlled server.

**Additional Information:**
*   The security bulletin rates CVE-2009-1929 as "Critical" for RDP version 6.1 on Windows Vista SP1 and later, Windows Server 2008, and as "Important" for RDP 6.0 on older Windows OS and versions.
*   The bulletin includes workarounds such as restricting access to `mstscax.dll` and disabling the Remote Desktop Connection ActiveX control in Internet Explorer.
*   It also discusses mitigating factors such as running Internet Explorer with Enhanced Security Configuration and having users with limited privileges.

**Mitigating Factors (CVE-2009-1929):**
*   By default, Outlook and Outlook Express open HTML emails in the Restricted sites zone, mitigating attacks by preventing ActiveX controls and Active Scripting usage. However, clicking a link in an email could still expose a user to the web based attack.
*   Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode, setting the security level for the Internet zone to High.
*   Users with accounts configured with fewer rights will have less impact if exploited.
*   RDP servers themselves are not affected, only RDP clients.
*   RDP Versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 6.0 and Remote Desktop Connection Client for Mac 2.0 are not affected by this vulnerability.

**Mitigating Factors (CVE-2009-1133):**

*   An attacker can only gain user level rights. Limited user accounts will limit the impact of an attack.
*   Web-based attacks require the user to visit a malicious site, typically by clicking a link in an email or instant message.
*   RDP servers are not vulnerable, only clients.
*   RDP version 6.0 and 6.1 cannot be exploited through a web site invoking the RDP ActiveX control.

**Workarounds (CVE-2009-1929 and CVE-2009-1133):**

*   Disabling the Remote Desktop Connection ActiveX control in Internet Explorer using the registry kill bit.
*   Setting Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting.
*   Restricting access to `mstscax.dll` (CVE-2009-1133 only).

**Note:**
* The provided documents include references to patch information, which are not extracted here.
* The vulnerability details are specific to the Remote Desktop Connection client component and the ActiveX control.
