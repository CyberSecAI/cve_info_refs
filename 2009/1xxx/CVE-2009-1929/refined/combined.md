How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-044 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in Remote Desktop Connection Could Allow Remote Code Execution (970927)

Published: August 11, 2009 | Updated: November 04, 2009

**Version:** 2.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker successfully convinced a user of Terminal Services to connect to a malicious RDP server or if a user visits a specially crafted Web site that exploits this vulnerability. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important for default versions of RDP on supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Vista for x64-based Systems, and Remote Desktop Connection Client for Mac 2.0 and is rated Critical for default versions of RDP on all other supported Windows editions. This security update is rated Important for RDP Version 6.0 that administrators can manually install on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition Service Pack 2 and is rated Critical for all other versions of RDP that administrators can manually install on supported Windows editions. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by changing the way the Remote Desktop Connection deals with unexpected parameters sent by the RDP server and by correctly validating parameters passed to the Remote Desktop Connection ActiveX control methods. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 970927](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/970927) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Remote Desktop Connection Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1133

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection (formerly known as Terminal Services Client) processes specific parameters returned by the RDP server. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-1133](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1133).

#### Mitigating Factors for Remote Desktop Connection Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1133

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* RDP servers are not affected by this vulnerability. Only RDP clients are affected.
* In RDP Version 6.0 and RDP Version 6.1, the vulnerability cannot be exploited by a malicious Web site that invokes the RDP ActiveX control, which connects the session to a malicious RDP server.

#### Workarounds for Remote Desktop Connection Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1133

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Restrict access to mstscax.dll**

  **Note** You must be an administrator to use these commands.

  **Windows XP and Windows Server 2003**

  Run the following commands from a command prompt:

  `cacls %windir%\system32\mstscax.dll /E /P everyone:N`

  `cacls %windir%\sysWOW64\mstscax.dll /E /P everyone:N`

  **Windows** **Vista** **and Windows Server 2008**

  Run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  `takeown /F %windir%\system32\mstscax.dll`

  `cacls %windir%\system32\mstscax.dll /E /P everyone:N`

  `takeown /F %windir%\SysWOW64\mstscax.dll`

  `cacls %windir%\SysWOW64\mstscax.dll /E /P everyone:N`

  `for /F "tokens=*" %G IN ('dir /b /s %windir%\winsxs\mstscax.dll') DO takeown /F %G && cacls %G /E /P everyone:N`

  \*\*Impact of workaround.\*\*After performing these steps, you will not be able to make outbound Remote Desktop connections.

  **How to undo the workaround**

  **Note** You must be an administrator to use these commands.

  **Windows XP and Windows Server 2003**

  Run the following commands from a command prompt:

  `cacls %windir%\system32\mstscax.dll /E /R everyone`

  `cacls %windir%\SysWOW64\mstscax.dll /E /R everyone`

  **Windows** **Vista** **and Windows Server 2008**

  Run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  `cacls %windir%\system32\mstscax.dll /E /R everyone`

  `cacls %windir%\SysWOW64\mstscax.dll /E /R everyone`

  `for /F "tokens=*" %G IN ('dir /b /s %windir%\winsxs\mstscax.dll') DO cacls %G /E /R everyone`
* **Prevent the Remote Desktop Connection ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer**

  You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.

  **Note** This workaround prevents exploitation through the Web-based attack vector, but it does not protect the user against manually initiating a connection to a malicious RDP server.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797).

#### FAQ for Remote Desktop Connection Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1133

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability could allow remote code execution. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection processes specific parameters returned by the RDP server. This issue results in a heap overflow on the client that can be leveraged by the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user.

**What is the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol?**

The Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) provides remote display and input capabilities over network connections for Microsoft Windows-based applications running on a server. RDP is based on, and is an extension of, the ITU T.120 family of protocols. RDP is a multiple-channel capable protocol that allows for separate virtual channels for carrying device communication and presentation data from the server, as well as encryption of the session. RDP provides an extensible base and supports up to 64,000 separate channels for data transmission and provisions for multipoint transmission. On some platforms, Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection is called Terminal Services Client.

Microsoft Windows implements RDP as follows:

* **Windows 2000:** Terminal Services includes enhanced RDP Version 5.0.
* **Windows XP Service Pack 2:** Uses RDP Version 5.1 for Remote Desktop Connection and for Remote Assistant. Windows XP also includes Remote Desktop Web Connection, which is an updated version of the Terminal Services Advanced Client (TSAC), an RDP client based on a Microsoft ActiveX control. Remote Desktop Web Connection supports RDP Version 5.1 and is backward compatible with RDP Version 5.0. In addition, two out-of-box updates are available which implement RDP Version 6.0 and RDP Version 6.1 on Windows XP Service Pack 2 respectively.
* **Windows XP Service Pack 3:** Uses RDP Version 5.2 for Remote Desktop Connection and for Remote Assistance.
* **Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2:** Uses RDP Version 5.2 for Remote Desktop Connection and for Remote Assistant. Remote Desktop Web Connection supports RDP Version 5.2 and is backward compatible with RDP Versions 5.1 and 5.0. In addition, an out-of-box update is available which implements RDP Version 6.0 on these platforms.
* **Windows** **Vista:** Uses RDP Version 6.0 for Remote Desktop Connection.
* **Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista Service Pack 1, and Windows** **Vista** **Service Pack 2:** Uses RDP Version 6.1 for Remote Desktop Connection.

**Why is this vulnerability rated Critical for all versions of RDP with the exception of RDP Version 6.0 and RDP Version 6.1?**

This vulnerability is rated Critical for RDP Version 5.0, RDP Version 5.1, and RDP Version 5.2 because of a specific attack scenario applicable to these RDP versions. In this attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability. Such a Web site could invoke the RDP ActiveX control without further user interaction after visiting the Web site and cause the control to connect the session to a malicious RDP server. On RDP Version 6.0 and RDP Version 6.1, exploitation requires the user to accept the connection by interacting with the user interface.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site and then convince a user to view the Web site. The Web site would then invoke the RDP Client ActiveX control to connect the session to a malicious RDP server. An attacker could also convince a user to manually connect to a remote RDP server in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site or engaged in a remote connection with another system for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, workstations or clients intended to connect to terminal servers are particularly affected by this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

This security update addresses the vulnerability by changing the way that the Remote Desktop Connection deals with unexpected parameters sent by the RDP server.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Remote Desktop Connection ActiveX Control Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1929

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Terminal Services Client ActiveX control. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could allow remote code execution if a user visited that page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-1929](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1929).

#### Mitigating Factors for Remote Desktop Connection ActiveX Control Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1929

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* RDP Version 5.0, RDP Version 5.1, RDP Version 5.2, RDP Version 6.0, and Remote Desktop Connection Client for Mac 2.0 are not affected by this vulnerability.
* RDP servers are not affected by this vulnerability. Only RDP clients are affected.

#### Workarounds for Remote Desktop Connection ActiveX Control Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1929

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Prevent the Remote Desktop Connection ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer**

  You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.

  **Note** This workaround prevents exploitation through the Web-based attack vector, but it does not protect the user against manually initiating a connection to a malicious RDP server.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797).

  **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

  **Impact of workaround.** Users will not be able to start remote desktop connections from within Web pages.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Delete the registry keys previously added in implementing this workaround.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for Remote Desktop Connection ActiveX Control Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1929

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability could allow remote code execution. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Remote Desktop Web Connection ActiveX control methods do not perform sufficient parameter validation.

**What is the Remote Desktop Web Connection ActiveX control?**

The Remote Desktop Web Connection ActiveX control allows you to access your computer, via the Internet, from another computer using Internet Explorer.

**What is the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol?**

The Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) provides remote display and input capabilities over network connections for Microsoft Windows-based applications running on a server. RDP is based on, and an extension of, the ITU T.120 family of protocols. RDP is a multiple-channel capable protocol that allows for separate virtual channels for carrying device communication and presentation data from the server, as well as encryption of the session. RDP provides an extensible base and supports up to 64,000 separate channels for data transmission and provisions for multipoint transmission. On some platforms, Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection is called Terminal Services Client.

Microsoft Windows implements RDP as follows:

* **Windows 2000:** Terminal Services includes enhanced RDP Version 5.0.
* **Windows XP Service Pack 2:** Uses RDP Version 5.1 for Remote Desktop Connection and for Remote Assistant. Windows XP also includes Remote Desktop Web Connection, which is an updated version of the Terminal Services Advanced Client (TSAC), an RDP client based on a Microsoft ActiveX control. Remote Desktop Web Connection supports RDP Version 5.1 and is backward compatible with RDP Version 5.0. In addition, two out-of-box updates are available which implement RDP Version 6.0 and RDP Version 6.1 on Windows XP Service Pack 2 respectively.
* **Windows XP Service Pack 3:** Uses RDP Version 5.2 for Remote Desktop Connection and for Remote Assistance.
* **Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2:** Uses RDP Version 5.2 for Remote Desktop Connection and for Remote Assistant. Remote Desktop Web Connection supports RDP Version 5.2 and is backward compatible with RDP Versions 5.1 and 5.0. In addition, an out-of-box update is available which implements RDP Version 6.0 on these platforms.
* **Windows** **Vista:** Uses RDP Version 6.0 for Remote Desktop Connection.
* **Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista Service Pack 1, and Windows** **Vista** **Service Pack 2:** Uses RDP Version 6.1 for Remote Desktop Connection.

**What is the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?**

Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the Security tab and the Advanced tab in the Internet Options dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:

* Security level for the Internet zone is set to High. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.
* Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.
* Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.
* Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.

For more information regarding Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, see the guide, [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d41b036c-e2e1-4960-99bb-9757f7e9e31b).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on a users system. This could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. The Web site would invoke the vulnerable ActiveX control and subsequently exploit the vulnerability.

Malicious Web sites can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site or engaged in a remote connection with another system for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, workstations or clients intended to connect to terminal servers are particularly affected by this vulnerability.

Clients that are being used to connect to Web-based Terminal Services (RDP) servers are particularly affected by this vulnerability, as they will have the control installed and operational. Other clients may be affected if they have the control installed, or may become affected if the users accepts installation of the control by a malicious web server.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correctly validating parameters for the Remote Desktop Web Connection ActiveX control methods.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

Alert
# Microsoft Updates for Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedJanuary 24, 2013
Alert CodeTA09-223A

### Systems Affected

* Microsoft Windows and Windows Server
* Microsoft Office
* Remote Desktop Connection Client for Mac 2.0

### Overview

Microsoft has released updates to address vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, Office Web Components and Remote Desktop Connection for Mac.

Microsoft has released multiple security bulletins for critical vulnerabilities in Windows, Windows Server, Office Web Components, and Remote Desktop Connection for Mac. These bulletins are described in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for August 2009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-aug.mspx).

Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS09-037.mspx) includes updates for Microsoft components to address vulnerabilities in the Active Template Library ([ATL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3ax346b7%28VS.71%29.aspx)). Vulnerabilities present in the ATL can cause vulnerabilities in the resulting ActiveX controls and COM components. Any ActiveX control or COM component that was created with a vulnerable version of the ATL may be vulnerable, including ones distributed by third-party developers.

Developers should update the ATL as described in the previously released Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-035.mspx) in order to stop creating vulnerable controls. To address vulnerabilities in existing controls, recompile the controls using the updated ATL. Further discussion about the ATL vulnerabilities can be found in the [Microsoft Security Advisory 973882](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/973882.mspx).

### Impact

An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code, in some cases without user interaction.

### Solution

**Apply updates from Microsoft**

Microsoft has provided updates for these vulnerabilities in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for August 2009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-aug.mspx). The security bulletin describes any known issues related to the updates. Administrators are encouraged to note these issues and test for any potentially adverse effects. Administrators should consider using an automated update distribution system such as [Windows Server Update Services](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/updateservices/default.mspx) (WSUS).
