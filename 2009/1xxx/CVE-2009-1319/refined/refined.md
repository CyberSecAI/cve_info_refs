Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1319:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability exists due to improper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input in the `lang` parameter of the `index.php` script within the GuestCal 2.1 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application allows an attacker to include local files via the `lang` parameter, without proper input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive files on the server, including system configuration files, application source code, and potentially other sensitive data.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** Successful LFI can be a stepping stone for more serious attacks, such as remote code execution, if the attacker can include and execute code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php`, using a malicious value in the `lang` parameter.
*   **Path Traversal:** The attack utilizes path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../..`) to navigate outside the intended directory and access arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** The provided exploit uses a null byte (`%00`) to potentially terminate the file path and bypass any restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of Application:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter (`lang`) in the `index.php` script.
*   **Basic Web Exploitation Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with path traversal and null byte techniques.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses a URL such as:
    `http://127.0.0.1/index.php?year=2009&object=1&lang=../../../../../BOOTSECT.BAK%00`
    This demonstrates an attempt to include the `BOOTSECT.BAK` file by traversing up the directory structure.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) showing how to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The provided information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description.
*   The vulnerable application is identified as GuestCal 2.1
*   The exploit was discovered by SirGod.
