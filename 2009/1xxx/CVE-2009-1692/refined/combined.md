How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I. Background
~~~~~~~~~~~
Quoting Wikipedia "ECMAScript is a scripting language, standardized by Ecma
International in the ECMA-262 specification and ISO/IEC 16262. The language
is widely used on the web, especially in the form of its three best-known
dialects, JavaScript, ActionScript, and JScript."

II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Calling the select() method with a large integer, results in continuos
allocation of x+n bytes of memory  exhausting memory after a while.
The impact varies from null pointer dereference (no more memory,hence
crashing the browser) to the reboot of the complete Operation System
(Konqueror&Ubuntu)

There had never been a limit specified as to how many html elements the select
call should handle, after the report of this Bug, vendors apparently agreed to a
limit of 10.000 elements : "Talked to some Apple and Opera guys at the
WHATWG social, and we decided this was a good number"

III. Impact
~~~~~~~~~
The Impact varies from Browser to Browser and from OS to OS.

Here is a small excerpt:
- Konqueror (Ubuntu)- allocates 2GB of memory then either crashes
the Browser or (most often) the OS reboots. Ubuntu's memory
management system appears to be configured as to NOT stop the process
that consumes too much memory, but a random process.
This sometimes leads to processes that are vital for the OS to
be killed, hence the reboot. I am not kidding. Thanks to
'FX' for Memory management hint.

- Chrome :  allocates 2GB of memory then crashes tab with a null pointer

- Firefox : allocates 2GB of memory then the Browser crashes

- IE5,6,7,8 : allocates 2GB of memory then the Browser crashes

- Opera : Allocated and commits as much memory as available,
will not crash but other applications will become unstable

- Nintento WII (Opera) : Console hangs, needs hard reset
Video: http://vimeo.com/2937101 (Thanks to David Raison)

- Sony PS3 - Console hangs, needs hard reset
Video: http://vimeo.com/2937101 (Thanks to Chris Gates)

- iPhone - iPhone hangs and needs hard reset
Video: http://vimeo.com/2873339 (Thanks to g0tcha)

- Aigo P8860 (Browser hangs and cannot be restarted)

IV. Proof of concept
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<script>
function poc(o) {
        e = document.createElement("select");
        e.length=2147483647;
}

function go() {
        poc(0);
}
</script>

URL: http://www.crashthisthing.com/select.html

Some have not understood what this code does, it does NOT loop as some vendors
claimed, it just calls select.lenght() ONCE with a huge integer. One might wonder
if over the 9 last years that this bug existed, nobody ever entered a large
number in a select.lenght() call.

IV. Disclosure timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nothing particular to note, except the usual discussion about availability being
a security issue.

V. Thanks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chris Gates, David Raison, Fahem Adam, a team of engineers that recognise themselves
and oCert for not helping coordinate this bug.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Debian Bug     : 532724 532725 534946 535793 538346

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in webkit, a Web content engine
library for Gtk+. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-0945

Array index error in the insertItemBefore method in WebKit, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code via a document with a SVGPathList data
structure containing a negative index in the SVGTransformList, SVGStringList,
SVGNumberList, SVGPathSegList, SVGPointList, or SVGLengthList SVGList object,
which triggers memory corruption.

CVE-2009-1687

The JavaScript garbage collector in WebKit does not properly handle allocation
failures, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a
denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML
document that triggers write access to an "offset of a NULL pointer."

CVE-2009-1690

Use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application
crash) by setting an unspecified property of an HTML tag that causes child
elements to be freed and later accessed when an HTML error occurs, related to
"recursion in certain DOM event handlers."

CVE-2009-1698

WebKit does not initialize a pointer during handling of a Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS) attr function call with a large numerical argument, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory
corruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML document.

CVE-2009-1711

WebKit does not properly initialize memory for Attr DOM objects, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(application crash) via a crafted HTML document.

CVE-2009-1712

WebKit does not prevent remote loading of local Java applets, which allows
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, gain privileges, or obtain sensitive
information via an APPLET or OBJECT element.

CVE-2009-1725

WebKit do not properly handle numeric character references, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory
corruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML document.

CVE-2009-1714

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Web Inspector in WebKit allows
user-assisted remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML, and read
local files, via vectors related to the improper escaping of HTML attributes.

CVE-2009-1710

WebKit allows remote attackers to spoof the browser's display of the host name,
security indicators, and unspecified other UI elements via a custom cursor in
conjunction with a modified CSS3 hotspot property.

CVE-2009-1697

CRLF injection vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to inject HTTP
headers and bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted HTML document, related
to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that depend on communication with
arbitrary web sites on the same server through use of XMLHttpRequest without a
Host header.

CVE-2009-1695

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving access to frame
contents after completion of a page transition.

CVE-2009-1693

WebKit allows remote attackers to read images from arbitrary web sites via a
CANVAS element with an SVG image, related to a "cross-site image capture issue."

CVE-2009-1694

WebKit does not properly handle redirects, which allows remote attackers to read
images from arbitrary web sites via vectors involving a CANVAS element and
redirection, related to a "cross-site image capture issue."

CVE-2009-1681

WebKit does not prevent web sites from loading third-party content into a
subframe, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and
conduct "clickjacking" attacks via a crafted HTML document.

CVE-2009-1684

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via an event handler that triggers script
execution in the context of the next loaded document.

CVE-2009-1692

WebKit allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption
or device reset) via a web page containing an HTMLSelectElement object with a
large length attribute, related to the length property of a Select object.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-4+lenny2.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.1.16-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your webkit package.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

                        * Sony PS3 - still affected* Nintendo Wii Opera - still affected, Opera sent a "notice" to Nintendo, never heard back from Opera* Others ? Find out by visiting the POC at <http://crashthisthing.com/select.html>

#### I. Background

Quoting Wikipedia "ECMAScript is a scripting language, standardized by Ecma
International in the ECMA-262 specification and ISO/IEC 16262. The language
is widely used on the web, especially in the form of its three best-known
dialects, JavaScript, ActionScript, and JScript."
#### II. Description

Calling the select() method with a large integer, results in continuous
allocation of x+n bytes of memory exhausting memory after a while.

The impact varies from null pointer dereference (no more memory,hence
crashing the browser) to the reboot of the complete Operation System
(Konqueror&Ubuntu).

There had never been a limit specified as to how many html elements the select call should handle, after the report of this Bug, vendors apparently agreed to a
limit of 10.000 elements : "Talked to some Apple and Opera guys at the
WHATWG social, and we decided this was a good number"

#### III. Impact

The impact
varies from browser to browser and sometimes from OS to OS

* Konqueror (Ubuntu)- allocates 2GB of memory then either crashes
  the Browser or (most often) the OS reboots. Ubuntu's memory
  management system is configured as to NOT stop the process that consumes
  too much memory, but a random process. This sometimes leads to
  processes that are vital for the OS to be killed, hence the reboot.
  I am not kidding. Thanks to 'FX' for the memory management hint.
* Chrome : allocates 2GB of memory then crashes tab with a null pointer
* Firefox : allocates 2GB of memory then the Browser crashes
* IE5,6,7,8 : allocates 2GB of memory then the Browser crashes
* Opera : Allocated and commits as much memory as available,
  will not crash but other applications will become unstable
* Nintento WII (Opera) : Console hangs, needs hard reset

  **Video:** <http://vimeo.com/2937101> (Thanks to David Raison)
* Sony PS3 - Console hangs, needs hard reset

  **Video:** <http://vimeo.com/2937101> (Thanks to Chris Gates)
* iPhone - iPhone hangs and needs hard reset

  **Video:** <http://vimeo.com/2873339> (Thanks to g0tcha)
* Aigo P8860 (Browser hangs and cannot be restarted)

#### IV. Proof of concept

<script>

function poc(o) {

e = document.createElement("select");

e.length=2147483647;

}

function go() {

poc(0);

}

</script>

URL: http://www.crashthisthing.com/select.html

Some have not understood what this code does, it does NOT loop as some vendors
claimed, it just calls select.lenght() ONCE with a huge integer. One might wonder
if over the 9 last years that this bug existed, nobody ever entered a large
number in a select.lenght() call.

#### V. Disclosure timeline

Nothing particular to note.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
