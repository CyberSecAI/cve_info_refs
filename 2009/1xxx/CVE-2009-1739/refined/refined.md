- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure cookie handling
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application uses cookies to store authentication information, but it does not properly protect the data. Specifically, the `authuser` cookie is used to store the username, and the application trusts this value without validation, leading to an authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to the application by setting the `authuser` cookie to a valid username, such as 'demo' or 'admin'.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by manipulating the client-side `authuser` cookie with JavaScript to a username of choice, and then accessing the administrative portion of the site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute Javascript on the victim's browser in order to set the `authuser` cookie. They also need to be aware of valid usernames that grant access to the admin portal.
