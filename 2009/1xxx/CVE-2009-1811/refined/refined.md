  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1811",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection and authentication bypass due to insufficient input sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, allowing for injection of malicious SQL code.",
          "Authentication Bypass: The application does not properly validate user credentials, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication using SQL injection."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application's database, potentially leading to: Data theft, Data modification, Complete compromise of the application, Full control of the application",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By manipulating the 'Name' and 'password' parameters when the application's magic_quotes setting is off, an attacker can inject SQL code into the authentication process to bypass login.",
        "Through the `ID` parameter in various modules by adding malicious SQL code, an attacker can extract user/password information or otherwise gain control over the database."
          ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They do not need prior knowledge of user credentials to perform an authentication bypass. For full control over the database, the attacker will need basic knowledge of SQL."

      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1811",

        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on a web page."
       ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to: Theft of cookies, Redirection to malicious sites, Defacement of websites, Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser",

       "By injecting malicious JavaScript code through various input fields including `Page`, `Kontext`, or `image` parameters, an attacker can trigger XSS on various pages"
