# libsndfile: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200905-09**

Multiple heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in libsndfile might
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libsndfile** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.20** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.20** |

### Background

libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing
sampled sound.

### Description

The following vulnerabilities have been found in libsndfile:

* Tobias Klein reported that the header\_read() function in
  src/common.c uses user input for calculating a buffer size, possibly
  leading to a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-1788).
* The
  vendor reported a boundary error in the aiff\_read\_header() function in
  src/aiff.c, possibly leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
  (CVE-2009-1791).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted AIFF
or VOC file in a program using libsndfile, possibly resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libsndfile users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libsndfile-1.0.20"
```

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : libsndfile
Vulnerability  : heap-based buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 528650
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-1788 CVE-2009-1791

Two vulnerabilities have been found in libsndfile, a library to read
and write sampled audio data.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identified the following problems:

Tobias Klein discovered that the VOC parsing routines suffer of a heap-based
buffer overflow which can be triggered by an attacker via a crafted VOC
header (CVE-2009-1788).

The vendor discovered that the  AIFF parsing routines suffer of a heap-based
buffer overflow similar to CVE-2009-1788 which can be triggered by an attacker
via a crafted AIFF header (CVE-2009-1791).

In both cases the overflowing data is not completely attacker controlled but
still leads to application crashes or under some circumstances might still
lead to arbitrary code execution.

For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.16-2+etch2.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.17-4+lenny2.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.20-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libsndfile packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

#### libsndfile Malware on Windows.

I just found a very suspicious bit torrent download available here:

[http://www.torrentzap.com/torrent/1581031/Libsndfile+%2864-Bit%29+1.0.23](http://www.torrentzap.com/torrent/1581031/Libsndfile%2B%2864-Bit%29%2B1.0.23)

The file being shared is intended to look like the Windows 64 bit installer for
libsndfile-1.0.23 and seems to be widely available on this and a number of other
torrent sites.

However, the file on the torrent sites is called
**libsndfile-64-bit-1.0.23.exe** while the one I distribute is
called
[**libsndfile-1.0.23-w64-setup.exe**](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/files/libsndfile-1.0.23-w64-setup.exe).

I haven't analyzed the torrent version of the file; I simply don't have the
tools or the knowledge to investigate it.
I don't even have access to a machine that runs 64 bit Windows.
The setup file on my website was cross compiled from Linux to 64 bit Windows
using the very wonderful
[MinGW w64](http://mingw-w64.org/)
tools and the setup installer created using
[INNO Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
running under
[Wine](http://www.winehq.org/).
However, the file is named differently and has a different md5sum.
That in itself is more than enough reason to be suspicious.

The valid file that I distribute has the following md5 and sha256 sums:

```

    md5sum    : efe73b7cb52724e7db7bb7d6ce145929
    sha256sum : 30896dac1002a7b509b6f4620317dad730d8ad761e4ff0402db5a94b0d4c09a2

```

I'm not really aware of how problems like this are addressed on Windows.
Is there a safe, secure, verifiable way of distributing Windows software
packages?
If so, I'd appreciate it if someone could let me know how its done.

For Linux this is much easier.
Firstly, the vast majority of people on Linux install libsndfile via their Linux
distribution.
The person who packages libsndfile for any given distribution grabs the source
code tarball from my
[web site](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download).
At the same time they should also grab the GPG signature file and verify that
the source code tarball is correct and valid.

I don't know what happens in all distributions, but in Debian, the person doing
the packaging GPG signs the package before uploading to the Debian servers.
Once the GPG signed package is uploaded, the packager's GPG signature is checked
before it goes into the unstable distribution.
From there the validity of the package is tracked all the way to where an end
user installs it on a machine via the
[process documented here](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s7.4.1).
This process means that its very difficult to get malware onto a Linux machine
via the distribution's package manager.

I suppose this in one more reason why people should be running Linux rather than
Windows.

#### The (Problems with the) RF64 File Specification.

One of the very common sound file formats that
[libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)
reads and writes is the
[WAV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV)
format.
This format uses unsigned 32 bit integers internally to specify chunk lengths
which limits the total size of well formed file to be about 4 gigabytes in size.
On modern systems with high bit widths, multiple channels and high sample rates,
this 4Gig limit can be run into very easily.
For instance at a sample rate of 96kHz, with 24 bit samples, a 5.1 surround
sound recording will run into the 4Gig limit after about 41 minutes.

In order to overcome the limitations of WAV, the
[European Broadcasting Union](http://www.ebu.ch/)
decided in 2006 to start the specification of an extended WAV file format
capable of handling 64 bit file offsets.
The document that resulted from this specification process was first released in
2006 and the latest update was made in 2009 and is
[available here](http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3306-2009.pdf).
I have a number of problems with this specification document.

First and foremost, in section 3.5, the document states:

> *In spite of higher sampling frequencies and multi-channel audio, some production
> audio files will inevitably be smaller than 4 Gbyte and they should therefore
> stay in Broadcast Wave Format.
>
>
>
> The problem arises that a recording application cannot know in advance whether
> the recorded audio it is compiling will exceed 4 Gbyte or not at end of
> recording (i.e. whether it needs to use RF64 or not).
>
>
>
> The solution is to enable the recording application to switch from BWF to RF64
> on the fly at the 4 Gbyte size-limit, while the recording is still going on.
>
>
>
> This is achieved by reserving additional space in the BWF by inserting a 'JUNK'
> chunk 3 that is of the same size as a 'ds64' chunk. This reserved space has no
> meaning for Broadcast Wave, but will become the 'ds64' chunk, if a transition
> to RF64 is necessary.*

In short, the suggestion above for writing a file boils down to:

1. Open the file and write a RIFF/WAV file header with a JUNK section big
   enough to allow the header to be replaced with an RF64 header if needed.
2. If the file ends up bigger than 4 gigabytes, go back and replace the
   existing header with an RF64 header.

There are two problems with this suggestion; it makes testing difficult and it
makes the software more complex which means its more likely to contain bugs.
The testing problem arises because testing that the RF64 header is written
correctly can only be done by writing a 4 gigabyte file.
Programmers can then either choose not to test this (which means the software is
is highly unlikely to work as specified) or test write a full 4 Gig file.
However, programmers also want their tests to run quickly (so that they can be
run often) and writing 4 gigabytes of data to disk is definitely not going to
be quick.
Of course, a smaller unit test might be able to bypass the requirement of
writing 4 gigabytes, but it would still be prudent to do a real test at the
WAV to RF64 switch over point.
The complexity problem is simply that writing a WAV file header first and then
overwriting it with an RF64 header later is far more complicated than just
writing an RF64 header to begin with.
Complexity breeds bugs.

The libsndfile project has had, from the very beginning, a pretty comprehensive
test suite and the running of that test suite takes about 30 seconds on current
hardware.
In order to comprehensively test the reading and writing of RF64 files,
libsndfile disregards the rather silly suggestion of the EBU to convert on the
fly between WAV and RF64 files.
If the software calling libsndfile specifies that an RF64 file be generated,
libsndfile will write an RF64 file, even if that file only contains 100 bytes.

A second problem with the RF64 specification is that the specification is
ambiguous in a very subtle way.
The problem is with how the binary chunks within the file are specified.
For WAV files, chunks are specified in
[this document](http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/documents/audioformats/wave/Docs/riffmci.pdf)
as:

```

  typedef unsigned long DWORD ;
  typedef unsigned char BYTE ;

  typedef DWORD FOURCC ;            // Four-character code
  typedef FOURCC CKID ;             // Four-character-code chunk identifier
  typedef DWORD CKSIZE ;            // 32-bit unsigned size value

  typedef struct {                  // Chunk structure
      CKID        ckID ;                   // Chunk type identifier
      CKSIZE      ckSize ;                 // Chunk size field (size of ckData)
      BYTE        ckData [ckSize] ;        // Chunk data
  } CK;

```

This specifies that a chunk has a 4 byte identifier, followed by a 4 byte chunk
size, followed by the chunk data.
The important thing to note here is that the chunk size does not include the
4 byte chunk identifier and the 4 byte chunk size field.
Inspecting real WAV files found in the wild will confirm that this is the case
for all common chunks found in WAV files.

Now contrast the above with how the chunks are specified in the EBU document.
Ror instance the **'fmt '** chunk (which is common to both WAV and
RF64) is specified as:

```

  struct FormatChunk5                // declare FormatChunk structure
  {
      char           chunkId[4];     // 'fmt '
      unsigned int32 chunkSize;      // 4 byte size of the 'fmt ' chunk
      unsigned int16 formatType;     // WAVE_FORMAT_PCM = 0x0001, etc.
      unsigned int16 channelCount;   // 1 = mono, 2 = stereo, etc.
      unsigned int32 sampleRate;     // 32000, 44100, 48000, etc.
      unsigned int32 bytesPerSecond; // only important for compressed formats
      unsigned int16 blockAlignment; // container size (in bytes) of one set of samples
      unsigned int16 bitsPerSample;  // valid bits per sample 16, 20 or 24
      unsigned int16 cbSize;         // extra information (after cbSize) to store
      char           extraData[22];  // extra data of WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE when necessary
  };

```

Here, the **chunkSize** field is simply the *"size of the 'fmt '
chunk"* and nowhere in the EBU document is it specified exactly how that
**chunkSize** field should be calculated.
However, if you give the EBU documentation to any experienced software engineer
with no previous knowledge of RIFF/WAV files, they would almost certainly assume
that the **chunkSize** field should be the size of the whole chunk,
including the **chunkID** and **chunkSize** fields.
However, someone who knows about RIFF/WAV files will be less likely to follow
that path.

This leaves the programmer implementing code to read and write this format with
a couple of possibilities:

* Assume that the document is right and should be followed to the letter.
* Assume the document is wrong and that the **'fmt '** chunk of
  an RF64 file should be identical to that of a WAV file.
* ~~Give up and go home.~~

However, the last part of section 3.5 of the EBU/RF64 document describes how a
WAV file is to be upgraded to an RF64 file, and that description makes no
mention of the **'fmt '** chunk being modified during that upgrade.
One can only assume from this, that the **'fmt '** chunk in an RF64
file should be identical to that of a WAV file and that the EBU/RF64
specification is misleading.

For libsndfile, I have decided to assume that the specification is indeed
misleading.
Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure that at some point I will be asked to at least
*read* files which strictly adhere to the literal interpretation of the
document.
I'm also pretty sure that implementing code to read files written to conform to
both interpretations of the spec will be a very painful exercise.

#### Distros and Test Suites.

libsndfile is cross platform and is expected to run on 32 and 64 bit CPUs on
any system that is reasonably POSIX compliant (ie even Windows).
It also has a lot of low level code that does things like endian swapping and
bit shifting etc.
Although I compile and test the code on all the systems I have access to, I
don't have access to everything.
That's why libsndfile has a test suite.

The libsndfile test suite is as comprehensive as I can make it.
Its taken a lot or work, over man years to get to where it is, but has saved me
many times that amount of work tracking obscure bugs.

The test suite is important.
That's why I suggest that anyone building libsndfile from source should run the
test suite before using the library.
This is especially true for people packaging libsndfile for distributions.
That's why is so disappointing to see something like this
[Gentoo bug](https://bugs.gentoo.org/335728).

Gentoo managed to mess up their build meta-data resulting in a libsndfile binary
that was horribly broken on 32 bit systems.
It was broken in such a way that just about every single test in the libsndfile
test suite would have failed.
Unfortunately, since Gentoo didn't run the test suite they distributed their
broken build meta-data to users.
And the users started emailing me with weird bug reports.

Fortunately, other distributions like Debian get it right.
Debian even keeps
[build logs](https://buildd.debian.org/)
for all releases of all packages on all architectures and makes them available
on the web.
For instance, the build log for libsndfile version 1.0.21-3 on the MIPS can be
[found here](https://buildd.debian.org/fetch.cgi?&pkg=libsndfile&ver=1.0.21-3&arch=mips&stamp=1280847502&file=log).

If anyone is using a distro which does not routinely run the test suite when
building packages which supply a test suite, I recommend that they switch to
a distro that does.

#### Jim Henson Co.

I received an email this morning:

```

  From: David XXX <xxx@creatureshop.com>
  To: <erikd@xxx.com>
  Subject: libsndfile usage
  Date: Thu, 4 Jun 2009 10:52:02 -0700
  User-Agent: Mozilla-Thunderbird 2.0.0.19 (X11/20090103)

  Erik, just thought I would mention we have been using libsndfile
  internally at the Jim Henson Co. for a while, we recently got approval
  to open source some of our utilities which mostly use libsndfile to read
  in wav files for encoding into a quicktime file, using libquicktime. We
  released them as usage examples and extras for libquicktime.

This is so cool.

Of course
[Jim Henson and Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jim_Henson_Company)
are probably best known for the Muppets and Sesame Street but a couple of
years ago my then four year old daughter absolutely loved watching
[Bear in the Big Blue House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_in_the_Big_Blue_House).

In a subsequent email David explained that the Bear program was before his
time, and that libsndfile was being used as part of the render process
in the production of
[Sid the Science Kid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_the_Science_Kid)
which I don't think has reached this country yet.

#### libsndfile 1.0.20.

There's a new release of libsndfile available in the
[usual place](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download).
This is a security bug fix release which fixes a potential heap overflow in VOC
files found and reported by Tobias Klein
[( http://www.trapkit.de/ )](http://www.trapkit.de/)
and another in the AIFF file parser found by me.

I am also making available patches for older versions of libsndfile:

* [Patch for 1.0.19.](http://www.mega-nerd.com/erikd/Blog/files/voc-aiff-patch-1.0.19.diff)
* [Patch for 1.0.18.](http://www.mega-nerd.com/erikd/Blog/files/voc-aiff-patch-1.0.18.diff)
* [Patch for 1.0.17.](http://www.mega-nerd.com/erikd/Blog/files/voc-aiff-patch-1.0.17.diff)
* [Patch for 1.0.16.](http://www.mega-nerd.com/erikd/Blog/files/voc-aiff-patch-1.0.16.diff)
* [Patch for 1.0.15.](http://www.mega-nerd.com/erikd/Blog/files/voc-aiff-patch-1.0.15.diff)

Hopefully the next release will contain new features instead of just bug fixes.

#### libsndfile 1.0.19.

There's a new release of libsndfile available in the
[usual place](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download).
There is also a back story about this release.

At about the same time as my blog post entitled
[*"Security Hyperventilating"*](http://www.mega-nerd.com/erikd/Blog/CodeHacking/SecretRabbitCode/hyperventilating.html)
I released version 1.0.18 of libsndfile.
A couple of days later I received an email from Alin Rad Pop of
[Secunia Research](http://www.secunia.com/)
(the company who got it right last time) informing me of a real, potentially
exploitable bug in my newly released code.
I've been told that this security vulnerability will be made public over the
next couple of days as
[CVE-2009-0186](http://www.vupen.com/english/Reference-CVE-2009-0186.php).

While I certainly didn't believe my code was bug free I have worked very hard
to reduce the bugs as much as possible.
I have a full and rather comprehensive test suite, I run valgrind over the code
regularly, I have learnt from past mistakes and I when I find one bug I nearly
always take the time to search for other instances of the same class of bug
in the code.

I even wrote a program to do automated
[Fuzz Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing).
This program takes an existing sound file, modifies it, writes it to disk and
then runs it through libsndfile.
If libsndfile segfaults or does anything else wildly wrong, the problem file is
saved for later review.
That review usually results in a bug fix.

In spite of all this testing, there was still a security vulnerability.
Thats mainly because libsndfile is one of those projects that needs to parse
untrusted binary data.
Remember all those exploitable bugs against libjpeg and libgif in the late
1990s?
Well both of those projects only parse one file type; libsndfile parses more
than a dozen.
The only other project I can think of with large numbers of different things to
parse is the
[Samba Project](http://www.samba.org/)
which needs to parse dozens of different kinds of messages in the
[CIFS](http://www.samba.org/cifs/)
protocol.

Of course there are other tools to for finding bugs;
[static analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_code_analysis)
tools.
In this field there are FOSS products like
[Sparse](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/sparse/)
and
[Splint](http://splint.org/).
The first is rather new and developed specifically to find bugs in Linux
kernel source code and the second is basically unmaintained.
Both are rather intrusive in that they require special annotations to help them
ignore valid code and find buggy code.

Neither of these FOSS programs compare well against commercial offerings like
[Coverity's Prevent](http://www.coverity.com/)
but Coverity is widely regarded as being rather expensive.
However, for FOSS projects, Coverity does have a
[program](http://scan.coverity.com/)
where it scans FOSS projects and feeds the scan results back to the projects so
they can fix bugs.

libsndfile was added to Coverity scan of FOSS projects well over a year ago.
I fixed all of the issues (mostly minor) pretty much immediately and then asked
to go on to the next
[rung of the ladder](http://scan.coverity.com/faq.html#what).
Unfortunately, I was told that I had to wait for all the projects that were
currently on rung 0 to fix their issues before that could happen.
Eventually, that did happen, but I don't remember anyone contacting me about
it.
This slow progress was frustrating.

However, on hearing that there was a CVE about to be published against
libsndfile I was fortunate enough to have someone offer to run libsndfile
through one of the commercial static analysis tools.
The result of that was a report containing 68 warnings, split into four roughly
equally sized groups:

* False positives.
* Warnings about header files being included un-necessarily.
* In test suite code not used in the library itself.
* Real bugs; resource leaks, dead code, reading beyond the end of arrays,
  off-by-one errors, not handling error return values, bad free calls etc.

The interesting thing about the above test was that the bug that resulted in the
CVE was still present in the code analysed by static analysis tool, but was
*not found*.
So while this tool did find a bunch of errors it is still not able to find
every error.
Obviously there is room for improvement here, both in my code and in the static
analysis tool.

#### Ten Years of libsndfile.

Today, February 15th 2009, is the ten year anniversary of the first release of
[libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/).

Like most FOSS projects, libsndfile started off as an urge to scratch an itch.
I was interested in
[Digital Signal Processing (DSP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing)
and wanted an easy way to get digital audio into and out of software I was
writing to try out various DSP algorithms.
Secondly, I wanted to a sound file editor and one important part of such an
editor is an ability to read and write various sound file formats.
I did however look at a couple of existing sound file editors and found that
most of them available at the time had buggy and incorrect WAV file handling.
So I started out getting that part fixed.
Nowadays, most sound file editors on Linux and many on other platforms use
libsndfile for file I/O.

In its 10 years of existence, libsndfile has grown from some 5000 lines of code
to over 45000 lines of code (not counting the test suite and the example
programs).
The earliest versions could read WAV, AIFF and AU file formats while the latest
version supports 25 formats and is still growing.

It was originally written to run on Linux and other UNIX-like systems but soon
ended up running on windows and Mac OS9 (the old non-Unix Apple Macintosh)
operating system.
Fortunately Mac OS9 has been assigned to the dustbin of history leaving windows
as the only operating system that was difficult or painful to support.
Recently, the windows development has moved to a system where the only way I
support building of libsndfile for that OS is to cross compile from Linux,
with the test suite being run under
[Wine](http://www.winehq.org/).
This has made my life significantly easier since I also release
[pre-compiled windows binaries](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download).

One surprise for me was that a
[Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libsndfile)
as added in 2006.
The page says:

> *"libsndfile is a widely-used [citation needed] C library"*

and I think that the ten year anniversary of the first release may be a good
time to look at where libsndfile is actually being used.
With a little research and some help from the libsndfile mailing lists, this
is what I found (in no particular order):

* Major computer music programming language and environments such as
  [ChucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/),
  [Csound](http://www.csounds.com/),
  [MusicKit](http://www.musickit.org/),
  [Nyquist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_%28programming_language%29),
  [PureData](http://puredata.info/),
  and
  [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/).
  Most of these apps are cross platform and require the use of libsndfile on
  all the platforms they support.
* [Ardour](http://www.ardour.org/),
  the premier cross platform (\*nix and MacOSX), Free Software Digital Audio
  Workstation
* [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), the ubiquitous,
  cross platform (\*nix, Mac and windows) audio editor.
* The [Pulse Audio](http://pulseaudio.org/) sound server
  uses libsndfile and is part of most modern Linux systems running the
  [Gnome environment](http://www.gnome.org/)
  and hence libsndfile is installed by default on all those systems.
* Linux media players like
  [Alsaplayer](http://www.alsaplayer.org/),
  [Aqualung](http://aqualung.factorial.hu/),
  [Audacious](http://audacious-media-player.org/),
  [MPlayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/)
  and
  [XMMS](http://www.mega-nerd.com/xmms_sndfile/),
  either by default or as an optional plugin.
* [Winamp](http://www.winamp.com/) one of the more popular
  and certainly one of the oldest media players on the windows platform.
* The
  [Ecasound](http://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound/),
  [Ecawave](http://ecasound.seul.org/ecawave/)
  and
  [Ecamegapedal](http://ecasound.sourceforge.net/ecamegapedal/)
  suite of Free Software programs.
* The
  [Levelator](http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/levelator),
  a tool for podcasters that automatically adjusts the levels of spoken-word
  recordings (Windows, Mac and Linux).
* Linux and Unix sound file editors like
  [Sweep](http://www.metadecks.org/software/sweep/)
  and
  [MhWaveEdit](https://gna.org/projects/mhwaveedit/).
* [Overtone Analyzer](http://www.sygyt.com/),
  a sound visualization tool for singing teachers, speech therapists,
  instrument builders and overtone singers.
* Linux based software audio synthesizers and samplers such as the
  [Amsynth](http://amsynthe.sourceforge.net/amSynth/)
  software synthesizer,
  [Freecycle](http://www.redsteamrecords.com/freecycle/),
  [Freewheeling](http://freewheeling.sourceforge.net/),
  the
  [Galan](http://galan.sourceforge.net/)
  synthesis environment,
  [Horgand](http://horgand.berlios.de/),
  the
  [Hydrogen](http://www.hydrogen-music.org/)
  drum machine,
  [Sooperlooper](http://essej.net/sooperlooper/),
  and the
  [Specimen](http://zhevny.com/specimen/)
  sample player.
* Linux trackers like
  [Aldrin](http://code.google.com/p/aldrin-sequencer/)
  and
  [Soundtracker](http://www.soundtracker.org/).
* [Mixxx](http://www.mixxx.org/),
  the Linux DJ program.
* The
  [FreeSWITCH](http://www.freeswitch.org)
  open source communications platform which runs natively on Windows, Mac
  OSX, Linux, \*BSD, and other Unix flavors.
* The
  [Baselight](http://www.filmlight.ltd.uk)
  (commercial product) colour grading system used worldwide for commercials,
  episodic television and feature film digital intermediate.
* Linux based audio/midi sequencers like
  [GNUSound](http://www.gnu.org/software/gnusound/),
  [MusE](http://www.muse-sequencer.org/),
  [Qtractor](http://qtractor.sourceforge.net/qtractor-index.html)
  and
  [Wired](http://wired.sourceforge.net/).
* [APTDecoder](http://www.poes-weather.com/index.php?Itemid=1&option=com_content),
  Free Software (GPL) for recording and decoding signals transmitted by NOAA
  POES APT enabled weather satellites.
* The
  [One Laptop Per Child](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/The_OLPC_Wiki)
  machines come with
  [CSound](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/CSound)
  and hence also include libsndfile.
* [X Lossless Decoder](http://tmkk.hp.infoseek.co.jp/xld/index_e.html),
  a Lossless audio decoder for Mac OS X.
* As part of Meyer Sound's
  [Wild Tracks](http://www.meyersound.com/products/lcs_series/matrix3/hd_playback.htm)
  hard-drive based multitrack audio playback and recording system.
* [AudioMove](http://www.lcscanada.com/audiomove)
  a GUI-based batch audio file converter/copier program (GPL).

On top of that there are language bindings for
[Fortran 77](http://tontonth.free.fr/libsound77.html),
[Free Pascal](http://ik.homelinux.org/index.rhtml/projects/fpc/sndfile),
[Haskell](http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hsndfile),
[Perl](http://search.cpan.org/~jdiepen/Audio-SndFile-0.07/lib/Audio/SndFile.pm),
Python (
[PySndfile](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/pysndfile/),
[AudioLab](http://svn.scipy.org/svn/scikits/trunk/audiolab),
[libsndfile-python](http://arcsin.org/softwares/libsndfile-python.html)
and possibly others ),
[Ruby](http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/ruby-audio/)
and probably many others.

Overall its been a fun ten years.
I've learnt a lot about writing reliable and portable cross platform code and
become a much better coder for it.
Having libsndfile as a hobby project has definitely helped my employment
prospects and my career as a professional software engineer.

The next ten years of libsndfile will mainly be maintenance, but new file formats
(I'm currently working on Ogg/Speex) and features will be added as needed.

#### libsndfile 1.0.18.

Over two years since the last one I've finally managed to do a new release of
[libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download).
The changes are:

* Ogg/Vorbis support (read and write) via the standard libsndfile API.
  Much of the Vorbis support was done by John ffitch of the
  [Csound](http://www.csounds.com/)
  project.
* Add support for new file formats RF64 and Akai MPC 2000.
* Added command line utilities sndfile-metadata-get and sndfile-metadata-set.
  These programs and some minor tweaks to libsndfile were a result of a
  contract with
  [George Blood Audio](http://www.georgebloodaudio.com/).
* Numerous minor bug fixes, cleanups and improvements in robust-ness.
* Built pre-compiled windows binaries for both
  [Win32](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download)
  and
  [Win64](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download),
  available as a standard windows style self extracting installer.
  These pre-compiled binaries were generated by cross compiling from Linux
  using the very wonderful
  [Debian MinGW cross compiler](http://packages.qa.debian.org/m/mingw32.html)
  for Win32 and the rather new and shiny
  [Mingw-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/)
  for Win64.
  The installers include the library itself, the utility programs, the public
  header file and a couple of example projects.

The Win32 installer and binaries have been tested under both
[Wine](http://www.winehq.org/)
and Windows XP.
The Win64 installer and binaries have received much less testing and should
be considered alpha quality.

For those compiling from source, it should be noted that the configure script
requires
[libvorbis](http://www.xiph.org/vorbis/)
version 1.2.1 or greater which is currently only available from
[Xiph SVN](http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/vorbis/).

#### libsndfile 1.0.17.

I've just released a new version of
[libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download).
The changes are:

* Add a C++ header file which acts as a wrapper around libsndfile's C API.
* Fix the documentation which describes using the precompiled windows DLL
  with evil ware compilers.
* Minor bug fixes and cleanups.

#### C++ Wrapper for libsndfile, Part 4.

I got some email from
[Jaq](http://spacepants.org/blog/)
who said:

> "You don't actually give a good reason for not wanting a close() method on
> SndfileHandle; your reasons for not wanting open() are good, but surely a
> handle needs a way of closing itself? Or does the API overload object
> deletion with the closing of the handle too?"

So first of all, I should have stated that my current candidate header file
is
[available here](http://www.mega-nerd.com/tmp/sndfile.hh).
The **SndfileHandle** object is designed to be used with the
[Resource Acquisition Is Initialization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization)
pattern.
In particular, the object will close the file and release all allocations when
it goes out of scope.
For instance:

```

  {
      SndfileHandle file ("foo.wav") ;

      // Do something with file which gets closed automatically
      // when file goes out of scope.
  }

```

So what's the problem with the close() method?
Well, its very similar to the problems with the open() method.
Lets look at an example:

```

  SndfileHandle file1 ("foo.wav") ;

  // Make file2 == file1
  SndfileHandle file2 = file1 ;

  // Close file1
  file1.close ("bar.wav") ;

```

Obviously, the handle associated with file1 should be closed, but
what about file2?
Should that be closed or remain open?

The fact that its not obvious means that its best left out.
If anyone really wants to make sure that a **SndfileHandle** is closed they
can do:

```

  SndfileHandle file1 ("foo.wav") ;

  // Make file2 == file1
  SndfileHandle file2 = file1 ;

  // Close file1
  file1 = SndfileHandle () ;

```

In this case its a little more obvious that file1 and file2 now refer to
different handles.

#### C++ Wrapper for libsndfile, Part 3.

Thinking about the C++ wrapper continues.
In the current candidate version, a **SndfileHandle** contains a pointer to
a private reference counted struct which contains the actual data.
The **SndfileHandle** class also has a copy constructor and an assignment
operator.

In addition to the above, a number of people on the mailing list have asked for
the SndfileHandle class to have open() and close() methods.
This seems reasonable on the face of it, but
[Daniel Schmitt](http://unu.nu/)
points out that the combination of copy/assign and open/close results in a
rather strange ambiguity.

Daniel gives the following example using copy/assign (ie no open/close methods):

```

  SndfileHandle file1 ("foo.wav") ;

  // Make file2 == file1
  SndfileHandle file2 = file1 ;

  // Now reuse file1
  file1 = SndfileHandle("bar.wav");

```

At the end of that block of code we now have file1 and file2 operating on
different handles, which is exactly what any reasonable programmer would
expect.

Now look at what happens if we have open/close methods:

```

  SndfileHandle file1 ("foo.wav") ;

  // Make file2 == file1
  SndfileHandle file2 = file1 ;

  // Now reuse file1
  file1.open ("bar.wav") ;

```

The open method can be implemented in one of the following two ways :

* Decrease the reference count on what file1 used to operate on and then
  initialize a one.
* Modify the data that both SndfileHandles point to.

After the block of code above, the two different implementations would result
in the following state :

* file1 and file2 refer to different handles
* file2 now refers to "bar.wav" which is even worse

Obviously, the second implementation is completely wrong, but the first
implementation is at least questionable.
In terms of providing something which balances utility and consistency I'm
tending to favor the idea of keeping the copy/assign operations and not
providing open/close methods.

#### C++ Wrapper for libsndfile, Part 2.

After
[yesterday's blog post](http://www.mega-nerd.com/erikd/Blog/CodeHacking/libsndfile/cpp_wrapper.html)
a guy in Germany,
[Daniel Schmitt](http://unu.nu/),
piped up on the libsndfile mailing lists and insisted I reconsider the C++
wrapper class' copy/assign issue.
My big problem with copy/assign were that they would not behave the way people
might reasonable expect them to.

Daniel's major contribution was renaming the class from **Sndfile** to
**SndfileHandle**.
Once that is done, having a copy constructor and an assignment operator using
reference counting makes sense.
With the class name containing the word "Handle", the name now fits the
behavior.
This is such a minor and seemingly trivial change but I simply didn't see it.

Thanks Daniel.
Brilliant!

#### A C++ Wrapper for libsndfile.

Over the years I've received a bunch emails saying stuff like *"why did you
write libsndfile in that old fashioned C language instead of nice modern shiny
C++?"*.
Obviously anyone who even thinks something like this is too ignorant of C to
be a good C++ programmer.
A competent C++ programmer needs to know and be comfortable with the whole of
the C language as well as the whole of C++.

At the time I started work on libsndfile in 1998 I was writing far more C++
code than C code.
However, back then, the GNU C++ compiler was nowhere near as good as it is
today and I thought a C library interface was a safer bet than C++.
In retrospect, I believe the decision of using C was spot on, for the following
reasons:

* The GNU C++ ABI (Application Binary Interface) has changed at least
  two times since 1998.
  The C ABI hasn't changed once in the same time frame.
* The level of C++ support by the GNU C++ compiler has been changing so
  much that using C++ for libsndfile would have been a huge pain.
  For instance, code that compiles without warnings with g++-3.3 can
  spit out a huge number of warnings for any later version of the compiler.
* Since 1999, the use of other high level languages has blossomed.
  Writing wrappers for these high level languages around C libraries is
  usually significantly easier than writing wrappers for C++ libraries.

However, some people do prefer C++ to C and many of those would probably be
writing their own C++ wrapper.
Since the vast majority of these wrappers would largely the same, it makes
sense for me to distribute a C++ wrapper with libsndfile.

I decided on the following set of criteria for the wrapper:

* It must be light weight.
  The wrapper should be a single header file with all methods being
  inlined.
* It should not depend on iostream.
* It should avoid the Standard Template Library.

It does however use templates for the read/write/readf/writef methods:

```

  template <typename T> sf_count_t read   (T *ptr, sf_count_t items) ;
  template <typename T> sf_count_t readf  (T *ptr, sf_count_t frames) ;
  template <typename T> sf_count_t write  (const T *ptr, sf_count_t items) ;
  template <typename T> sf_count_t writef (const T *ptr, sf_count_t frames) ;

```

with explicit specializations for types short, int, float and double.

It also explicitly makes the copy constructor and assignment operator private.
The problem with these two is that two objects wrapping the same SNDFILE\*
pointer will not give the expected behavior.
With the C version:

```

  SNDFILE *file1 = sf_open (filename, ...);
  SNDFILE *file2 = file1 ;

```

anyone reading the code can see that file1 and file2 are two pointers pointing
to the same object.
The code reader knows what behavior to expect here.

Now contrast this with the C++ version:

```

  Sndfile file1 (filename, ...) ;
  Sndfile file2 (file1) ;

```

The objects file1 and file2 look like two independent objects and should behave
like two independent objects, but instead they behave like they do in the C
version above.
I believe that this is inconsistent.

The only solution that would maintain consistency would be to make the copy
constructor do a deep copy but that is simply too much of a pain in the neck to
implement.

The current version of the wrapper is
[available here](http://www.mega-nerd.com/tmp/sndfile.hh)
or in verision 1.0.17 or later of
[libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download).

Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound
(such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format) through one standard
library interface. It is released in source code format under the
[Gnu Lesser General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).

The library was written to compile and run on a Linux system but should compile
and run on just about any Unix (including MacOS X).
There are also pre-compiled binaries available for 32 and 64 bit windows.

It was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and big-endian
(such as AIFF) data, and to compile and run correctly on little-endian (such as Intel
and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems as well as big-endian processor systems such
as Motorola 68k, Power PC, MIPS and Sparc.
Hopefully the design of the library will also make it easy to extend for reading and
writing new sound file formats.

It has been compiled and tested (at one time or another) on the following systems:

* Every platform supported by Debian GNU/Linux including x86\_64-linux-gnu,
  i486-linux-gnu, powerpc-linux-gnu, sparc-linux-gnu, alpha-linux-gnu,
  mips-linux-gnu and armel-linux-gnu.
* powerpc-apple-darwin7.0 (Mac OS X 10.3)
* sparc-sun-solaris2.8 (using gcc)
* mips-sgi-irix5.3 (using gcc)
* QNX 6.0
* i386-unknown-openbsd2.9

At the moment, each new release is being tested on i386 Linux, x86\_64 Linux,
PowerPC Linux, Win32 and Win64.

# **Features**

libsndfile has the following main features :

* Ability to read and write a large number of file formats.* A simple, elegant and easy to use Applications Programming Interface.* Usable on Unix, Win32, MacOS and others.* On the fly format conversion, including endian-ness swapping, type conversion
        and bitwidth scaling.* Optional normalisation when reading floating point data from files containing
          integer data.* Ability to open files in read/write mode.* The ability to write the file header without closing the file (only on files
              open for write or read/write).* Ability to query the library about all supported formats and retrieve text
                strings describing each format.

libsndfile has a comprehensive test suite so that each release is as bug free
as possible.
When new bugs are found, new tests are added to the test suite to ensure that
these bugs don't creep back into the code.
When new features are added, tests are added to the test suite to make sure that
these features continue to work correctly even when they are old features.

The following table lists the file formats and encodings that libsndfile can read
and write.
The file formats are arranged across the top and encodings along the left
edge.

From version 1.0.18, libsndfile also reads and writes
[FLAC](http://flac.sourceforge.net/)
and
[Ogg/Vorbis](http://www.vorbis.com/).

Some of the file formats I am also interested in adding are:

* Kurzweil K2000 sampler files.* Ogg Speex.

I have decided that I will not be adding support for MPEG Layer 3 (commonly
known as MP3) due to the patent issues surrounding this file format.
See
[the FAQ](FAQ.html#Q020)
for more.

Other file formats may also be added on request.

# **History**

My first attempt at reading and writing WAV files was in 1990 or so under Windows
3.1.
I started using Linux in early 1995 and contributed some code to the
[wavplay](http://www.vaxxine.com/ve3wwg/gnuwave.html)
program.
That contributed code would eventually mutate into this library.
As one of my interests is Digital Signal Processing (DSP) I decided that as well as
reading data from an audio file in the native format (typically 16 bit short integers)
it would also be useful to be able to have the library do the conversion to floating
point numbers for DSP applications.
It then dawned on me that whatever file format (anything from 8 bit unsigned chars,
to 32 bit floating point numbers) the library should be able to convert the data to
whatever format the library user wishes to use it in.
For example, in a sound playback program, the library caller typically wants the sound
data in 16 bit short integers to dump into a sound card even though the data in the
file may be 32 bit floating point numbers (ie Microsoft's WAVE\_FORMAT\_IEEE\_FLOAT
format).
Another example would be someone doing speech recognition research who has recorded
some speech as a 16 bit WAV file but wants to process it as double precision floating
point numbers.

# **Licensing**

libsndfile is released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License,
of which there are two versions;
[version 2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html)
and
[version 3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).
To maximise the compatibility of libsndfile, the user may choose to use libsndfile
under either of the above two licenses.
You can also read a simple explanation of the ideas behind the GPL and the LGPL
[here](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html).

You can use libsndfile with
[Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/),
[Open Source](http://www.opensource.org/),
proprietary, shareware or other closed source applications as long as libsndfile
is used as a dynamically loaded library and you abide by a small number of other
conditions (read the LGPL for more info).
With applications released under the GNU GPL you can also use libsndfile statically
linked to your application.

I would like to see libsndfile used as widely as possible but I would prefer it
if you released software that uses libsndfile as
[Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/)
or
[Open Source](http://www.opensource.org/).
However, if you put in a great deal of effort building a significant application
which simply uses libsndfile for file I/O, then I have no problem with you releasing
that as closed source and charging as much money as you want for it as long as you
abide by [the license](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html).

# **Download**

Here is the latest version. It is available in the following formats:

* Source code as a .tar.gz :

  and
  [GPG signature](files/libsndfile-1.0.28.tar.gz.asc).* Win32 installer:
    [libsndfile-1.0.28-w32-setup.exe](files/libsndfile-1.0.28-w32-setup.exe) (thoroughly tested under
    [Wine](http://www.winehq.com/))
    and
    [GPG signature](files/libsndfile-1.0.28-w32-setup.exe.asc).* Win64 installer:
      [libsndfile-1.0.28-w64-setup.exe](files/libsndfile-1.0.28-w64-setup.exe) (thoroughly tested under
