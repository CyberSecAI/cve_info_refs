How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

apt-get does not properly handle revoked or expired key signatures since it internally uses gpgv vs gpg to check signatures, and does not properly check for the error codes. It uses VALIDSIG to determine if a signature is valid, but this code can be given if the signature itself has expired, the signing key has expired, or the key has been revoked.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Add a source with expired or revoked key to sources.list (or set the system clock far enough that a key appears to be expired)

2. Run apt-get update

3. No warning message is printed from apt-get.

I'm working on a bazaar branch to resolve this now by properly using gpg vs gpgv and checking the status messages from GPG.

The Debian bug linked does not include that revoked signatures are a problem.

I looked at the branch that Michael posted and this is a no-go for a security update for stable because:

a) it adds new strings

b) it changes config option names:

- string pubringpath = \_config->Find("APT::GPGV::TrustedKeyring", "/etc/apt/trusted.gpg");

+ string pubringpath = \_config->Find("APT::gpg::TrustedKeyring", "/etc/apt/trusted.gpg");

Currently I believe this is a problem with gpgv and should adressed there (also there is some argument

about this given that the man page for gpgv states that it will trust any key).

So it seems like the check for VALIDSIG is incorrect (also the doc/DETAILS says:

   VALIDSIG <fingerprint in hex> <sig\_creation\_date> <sig-timestamp>

                <expire-timestamp> <sig-version> <reserved> <pubkey-algo>

                <hash-algo> <sig-class> <primary-key-fpr>

The signature with the keyid is good. This is the same as

        GOODSIG but has the fingerprint as the argument.

)

The doc for GOOGSIG says:

   GOODSIG <long keyid> <username>

        The signature with the keyid is good. For each signature only

        one of the three codes GOODSIG, BADSIG or ERRSIG will be

        emitted and they may be used as a marker for a new signature.

So it seems like the check for VALIDSIG is incorrect (also the doc/DETAILS says:
VALIDSIG <fingerprint in hex> <sig\_creation\_date> <sig-timestamp>
<expire-timestamp> <sig-version> <reserved> <pubkey-algo>
<hash-algo> <sig-class> <primary-key-fpr>
The signature with the keyid is good. This is the same as
GOODSIG but has the fingerprint as the argument.
)
The doc for GOOGSIG says:
GOODSIG <long keyid> <username>
The signature with the keyid is good. For each signature only
one of the three codes GOODSIG, BADSIG or ERRSIG will be
emitted and they may be used as a marker for a new signature.

So it seems validsig is written on the status-fd but no goodsig for revoked/expired keys, here is what I see (I ran it with both gpgv and gpg to be able to compare the output):

Here is what gpgv/gpg outputs (on the status fd):

My reading of the above is that the gpg method should check for GOODSIG and only accept signatures that have that, VALIDSIG is not enough. This looks like it might be trick to do without adding new strings :/

It also needs to be verified that all versions of gpgv (back down to dapper) behave consistently in the way that is shown above. The test above was done using jaunty.

I just checked if the behavior is the same on dapper and my tests indicate it is. Additional testing/clarification is very welcome.

I looked at the code in gpg/gpgv at mainproc.c:check\_sig\_and\_print() and GOODSIG is only set if its neither bad/expired/revoked:

...

 if(rc)

   statno=STATUS\_BADSIG;

 else if(sig->flags.expired)

   statno=STATUS\_EXPSIG;

 else if(is\_expkey)

   statno=STATUS\_EXPKEYSIG;

 else if(is\_revkey)

   statno=STATUS\_REVKEYSIG;

 else

   statno=STATUS\_GOODSIG;

...

Validsig OTOH is returned ignoring the above statuses.

* [proposed fix](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/%2Bbug/356012/%2Battachment/541821/%2Bfiles/gpgv.diff)
  [Edit](/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/%2Bbug/356012/%2Battachment/541821)
  (4.0 KiB,
  text/plain)

Here is a proposed fix. It does the following:

\* recognize KEYEXPIRED and KEYREVOKED messages from gpgv and put them into a new "WorthlessSignatures " vector

 \* only listen for GOODSIG message from gpgv and ignore VALIDSIG (as GOODSIG is only send when the signature is not with a expired or revoked key)

 \* if there is no good signature, show a message that displayes the worthless signatures to the user (including the KEYEXPIRED or KEYREVSIG bits to ensure there is a way to know what is going on)

 \* if there is one (or more) good signature and worthless signatures, just ignore the worthless ones

That should hopefully cover the problem without breaking strings and compatibility. Feedback/review/testing is very welcome. I tested it in a etch chroot with various expired settings and it works as it should, but I need to make a test-suit for it too. I will also pass it for review to debian.

I did a simple "test-suite" to test problem and

fix at:

$ bzr get [lp:~mvo/+junk/apt-gpgv-tests](/%2Bcode/~mvo/%2Bjunk/apt-gpgv-tests)

$ cd apt-gpgv-tests

$ sudo ./test.sh

It does test "good","expired","revoked","revoked+good","expired+good".

It should fail for expired and revoked (they are no good) but should

pass for revoked+good and expired+good. Basicly it will ignore expired

or revoked signatures if there is anohter valid signature on the

Release file.

Again, feedback/review is very welcome.

Cheers,

 Michael

I spent quite a bit of time reviewing this and feel the the patch is correct. It applies cleanly to intrepid and hardy, has some fuzz on gutsy and needed small adjustments for dapper. I also verified the strings for dapper-intrepid, and there are no new string changes.

I went through the logic of the VerifyGetSigners by hand using desk-checking (see attached for review) for GoodSigners, BadSigners, WorthlessSigners, and NoPubKeySigners being either empty or not empty, and believe the patch to be correct.

I also added several tests to Michael's test suite to ensure apt is working properly after patching and did not introduce regressions. I'll make these available shortly.

I added some extra tests to [https://code.launchpad.net/~jdstrand/+junk/apt-gpgv-tests](https://code.launchpad.net/~jdstrand/%2Bjunk/apt-gpgv-tests). To use:

$ bzr get [lp:~jdstrand/+junk/apt-gpgv-tests](/%2Bcode/~jdstrand/%2Bjunk/apt-gpgv-tests)

$ cd apt-gpgv-tests

$ sudo ./test.sh

Michael, I plan to add these to <https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-bugcontrol/qa-regression-testing/master/> which is why there is copyright information in my branch. Please let me know if I should change anything or you don't want it included.

Thanks a lot Jamie for the additional tests and the desk\_check.txt. That is great.

The copyright is fine, I was just to lazy^Wbusy to add it myself. Please add it to the tracker, I will do the jaunty upload in parallel (including your fix for the date problem).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

If I update from an archive whose key recently expired and I have
not yet updated the local copy via apt-key -- the local keyring says
it's expired -- APT does not complain but just proceeds. I think it
should *at least* warn.

Hi Martin,

Going through the security issues to fix before lenny, I came by this bug.

I think key expiry is a rather peripheral part of the PGP model. It's designed
to combat proliferation of keys for which the private key was lost.

While it is desirable to implement key expiry, and I hope that the APT team
will do so, I do have doubts whether this sould be critical for the release
of Debian Lenny. Can you provide a scenario that illustrates the criticality
of this issue?

cheers,
Thijs

No, it just casts a rather bad light on the implementation of
signature checking in APT.

That could be true, but is subjective. In a similar way my impression of a
program with typos in its strings is that it may be sloppily made. Still I
don't think such a situation is a critical bug.

I propose to put this bug at severity "important" which for me strikes the
right balance between being 'very desirable to fix' and not being 'an actual,
critical security hole'. OK?

Obviously fixing it is the real solution.

cheers,
Thijs

Sure, we wouldn't want to endanger our release schedule for feature
enhancements or Debian's reputation. ;|

Or put differently, I'd rather spend our time on things that more
significantly improve the security a of Debian system, and to be frank I
think it's quite speculative that there's actual reputation risk here.

If you believe that this would actually be detrimental to Debian's reputation,
surely the APT developers would gladly accept your patch?

Hi,

I just cloned and reassigned your bug about apt-get ignoring expired
keys. apt-get forks gpgv to do the actual verification and that gives
no indication of any expirey. So apt-get has no chance to detect and
warn about such an event.

Werner, what do you think of implementing key expiry checking in gpgv?

So why the fuck do we ship apt keys with expiration dates anyway, if apt
happily ignores them?

When I create a key and add that to apt's trusted-keys with an
expiration date of foo I fully expect it to not be trusted afterwards.

But heck, I can even create new signatures made after the expiration
date and apt will happily accept any and all Release files signed by
that expired key.

I was shocked when I realized this today, after reading this bug
report I'm dumbfounded that you even consider this acceptable!

still shaking my head,
weasel

I don't think that's correct.

No GOODSIG.

So gpgv considers a signature valid that gpg doesn't.  That in itself
should be a grave bug.

Sorry for this. I'm looking through the code now and it seems like
this caused by a misinterpretation of the gpg documentation for the
GOODSIG vs VALIDSIG status mesages (and is in the code since day 1 of
apt-secure :(

I'm working on a patch now and would appreicate help with the
testing/verification ones its ready.

Thanks,
 Michael

Hi,

I did some investigation and it seems like gpgv is sending the right
message, but the gpgv method in apt is not reading them
properly. There is also the problem that VALIDSIG is send even for
expired/revoked signatures and apt is checking for that (instead of
using GOODSIG). However the docs in doc/DETAILS in gpg make this
difference not clear.

Attached is a possible fix. It does the following:

 * recognize KEYEXPIRED and KEYREVOKED messages from gpgv and put them
   into a new "WorthlessSignatures " vector
 * only listen for GOODSIG message from gpgv and ignore VALIDSIG (as
   GOODSIG is only send when the signature is not done with a expired or
   revoked key)
 * if there is no good signature, show a message that displays the
   worthless signatures to the user (including the KEYEXPIRED or
   KEYREVSIG bits to ensure there is a way to know what is going on)
 * if there is one (or more) good signature and worthless signatures,
   just ignore the worthless ones

That should hopefully cover the problem without breaking strings and
compatibility. Feedback/review/testing is very welcome. I tested it in
a etch chroot with various expired settings and it works as it should,
but I need to make a test-suit for it too.

Cheers,
 Michael

I screwed up the version number, but the packages should work
anyway, and that's fine for testing purposes...

Thanks a lot for this. I did a simple "test-suite" to test problem and
fix via:
$ bzr get lp:~mvo/+junk/apt-gpgv-tests
$ cd apt-gpgv-tests
$ sudo ./test.sh

It does test "good","expired","revoked","revoked+good","expired+good".

It should fail for expired and revoked (they are no good) but should
pass for revoked+good and expired+good. Basicly it will ignore expired
or revoked signatures if there is anohter valid signature on the
Release file.

Again, feedback/review is very welcome.

Cheers,
 Michael

I merged the diff into the apt debian-sid tree and will upload soon. I
would love to have some positivie test feedback before I do the
upload.

Could you please run (preferably only with the debian.madduck.net url):
# apt-get update -o debug::acquire::gpgv=true
and attach the output? I just tested it on my system and it seems to
be working (your clock was not off for some reason, e.g. to test
expiring keys?).

FWIW, /usr/share/doc/gnupg/DETAILS.gz says:

    GOODSIG     <long keyid>  <username>
        The signature with the keyid is good.  For each signature only
        one of the three codes GOODSIG, BADSIG or ERRSIG will be
        emitted and they may be used as a marker for a new signature.
        The username is the primary one encoded in UTF-8 and %XX
        escaped.

 [...]

    VALIDSIG   <fingerprint in hex> <sig_creation_date> <sig-timestamp>
               <expire-timestamp> <sig-version> <reserved> <pubkey-algo>
               <hash-algo> <sig-class> <primary-key-fpr>

        The signature with the keyid is good. This is the same as
        GOODSIG but has the fingerprint as the argument. Both status
        lines are emitted for a good signature.  All arguments here
        are on one long line.  sig-timestamp is the signature creation
        time in seconds after the epoch. expire-timestamp is the
        signature expiration time in seconds after the epoch (zero
        means "does not expire"). sig-version, pubkey-algo, hash-algo,
        and sig-class (a 2-byte hex value) are all straight from the
        signature packet.  PRIMARY-KEY-FPR is the fingerprint of the
        primary key or identical to the first argument.  This is
        useful to get back to the primary key without running gpg
        again for this purpose.

So the documentation itself is unclear about the intended behavior.  Can
a signature be VALIDSIG but not GOODSIG?  What about the situation where
neither GOODSIG, BADSIG, nor ERRSIG show up, as is the case here?

i agree with weasel that this is currently a really bad situation.  It
is bad enough that gpg accepts a signature made by an expired key if the
signature was during the key's lifetime.  But it also does not
explicitly reject signatures that were made after a key is known to expire.

That is, Key A is valid beginning at time B, and expires at time E.
gnupg does not appear to distinguish between these cases:

 0) a signature made at time X where B < X < E

 1) a signature made at time X where B < E < X

At the very least, any signature made by a key *after* the key itself is
believed to be expired (case 1 above) should be considered
untrustworthy, but gpg (and gpg2, according to my tests) don't seem to
compare the date of the signature against the key expiration at all
(though they do compare it against the key creation timestamp).  They
*do* compare the key expiration time against "now", which is a good thing.

I'm attaching a tarball with an OpenPGP public key, a simple test file,
and two signatures made over the test file.  One of the signatures is
made within the lifespan of the key, and the other is made after the key
expires.

I'm not sure what is the right thing to do about this.  :(

After playing around with this and having to use --keyring,
I eventually found out that I hadn't updated the key in
/etc/apt/trusted.gpg in the chroot. :)

So it seems to work. Thanks!

# CVE-2009-1358

| **Name** | CVE-2009-1358 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | apt-get in apt before 0.7.21 does not check for the correct error code from gpgv, which causes apt to treat a repository as valid even when it has been signed with a key that has been revoked or expired, which might allow remote attackers to trick apt into installing malicious repositories. |

Package        : apt
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1300 CVE-2009-1358
Debian Bug     : 523213 433091

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in APT, the well-known dpkg
frontend. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-1300

    In time zones where daylight savings time occurs at midnight,
    the apt cron.daily script fails, stopping new security updates
    from being applied automatically.

CVE-2009-1358

    A repository that has been signed with an expired or revoked
    OpenPGP key would still be considered valid by APT.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.46.4-0.1+etch1.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.7.20.2+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
