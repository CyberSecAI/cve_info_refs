The provided content relates to CVE-2009-1247.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to both SQL injection and Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** The `login.php` script directly incorporates user-supplied data (`$username` and `$password`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization.
2.  **Remote File Inclusion:** The `container.php` and `header.php` scripts include files based on a user-controlled parameter `$theme_directory` without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application. This could lead to data breaches and full control of the application's database.
2.  **Remote File Inclusion:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable server. This could lead to complete compromise of the server and data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** The attacker sends a specially crafted username and password via the login form.
2.  **Remote File Inclusion:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `container.php` or `header.php`, including a malicious URL in the `theme_directory` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** No special position is required; an attacker can interact with the application's login page.
2.  **Remote File Inclusion:** No special position is required; an attacker can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable scripts. The attacker needs to host a malicious file accessible via a URL.
