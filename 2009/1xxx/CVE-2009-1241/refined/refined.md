{
  "CVE-2009-1241": {
    "Description": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in ClamAV 0.94.2, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issues by updating ClamAV to version 0.95.2.",
    "Root cause": "The ClamAV parsing engine can be bypassed by manipulating a RAR archive in a way that the ClamAV engine cannot extract the content, while the end user can.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inability to properly parse malformed RAR archives",
      "Bypass of scanning engine by malformed archive"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the ClamAV scanning engine allowing malicious code to go undetected when scanning RAR archives. This could result in malware infections on systems where archives are not extracted or scanned again post-extraction.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted RAR archive that exploits the parsing engine to bypass content inspection.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malformed RAR archive and then send it to a system running the vulnerable version of ClamAV."
