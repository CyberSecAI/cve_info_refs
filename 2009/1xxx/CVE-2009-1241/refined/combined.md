1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- openswan/strongswan
By sending a specially crafted Dead Peer Detection (DPD) packet
remote attackers could crash the pluto IKE daemon (CVE-2009-0790).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- clamav
ClamAV was updated to version 0.95 to also fix some potential security
bugs. (CVE-2009-1241)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED, OES, SLES9-11
- gstreamer-0\_10-plugins-base
Specially crafted cover art tags in vorbis files could trigger a
heap overflow in the base64 decoder. Attackers could potentially
exploit that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2009-0586).
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0, SLE11
- gnome-panel
The dbus package used a too permissive configuration. Therefore intended
access control for some services was not applied (CVE-2008-4311).
The new configuration denies access by default. Some dbus services break
due to this setting and need an updated configuration as well.
Affected products: openSUSE 11.1
- postgresql
Remote authenticated users could crash the postgresql server by requesting
a conversion with an inappropriate encoding (CVE-2009-0922). This was a
minor version upgrade.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLED, OES, SLES9-11
- acroread\_ja
Multiple flaws in the JBIG2 decoder and the JavaScript engine of the
Adobe Reader allowed attackers to crash acroread or even execute
arbitrary code by tricking users into opening specially crafted PDF
files. (CVE-2009-0658, CVE-2009-0927, CVE-2009-0193, CVE-2009-0928,
CVE-2009-1061, CVE-2009-1062)
Affected products: SLED10-11
- ghostscript
With this update the ghostscript-library four vulnerabilities were fixed:
- heap-overflow in JBIG2 decoder (CVE-2009-0196)
- integer overflow in ICC library (CVE-2009-0792)
- crash in CCITTFax decoder
- buffer overflow in BaseFont writer module
Affected products: SLE11 (packages for other products will be
released soon)
- xine-devel/libxine-devel
Specially crafted 4x movie files could cause an integer overflow in
xine-lib (CVE-2009-0698).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10-11
- moodle
Special command sequences in TeX files allowed users to read arbitrary
files (CVE-2009-1171).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1
- gnutls
The previous security fix for gnutls (CVE-2008-4989) introduced a re-
gression in the X.509 validation code for self-signed certificates.
This update fixes this problem.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLE10 (will be released soon),
SLE11
- udev update on SLES 10 requires udevd restart
The previously released udev update requires a restart of the udev
daemon on SLES 10. Either use
/etc/init.d/boot.udev restart
or reboot the machine.
On other SUSE products udevd is restarted by just applying the update
already.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

The details are scant, but I believe bug #1462[1] to be different from the
unrar issue discussed in the blog and CVE-2009-1241.

Specifically, the patch for 1462 is svn commit r4981 to
libclamav/untar.c to prevent a DoS (infinite loop).

Also, bug 1335[2] is fixed in commit r4980 by a patch to cli_scanpe() in
libclamav/pe.c to prevent a DoS (divide by zero).

AFAICT, the unrar issue (CVE-2009-1241) is covered in Debian bug
#484642[3] and clamav bug #1050[4].

Could we get CVE identifiers for the two remaining issues?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**Generic ClamAV archive evasion**

Release mode: Coordinated but limited disclosure.Ref : TZO-05-2009-ClamAV EvasionVendor : http://www.clamav.net & http://www.sourcefire.com/products/clamavSecurity notification reaction rating : Good

**Affected products :**

* ClamAV below 0.95
* Includes MACOSX server,IBM Secure E-mail Express Solution for System and a lots of mail appliances. http://www.clamav.net/about/who-use-clamav/

About this advisory

I used to not report bugs publicly where a a vendor - has not reacted to my notifications - silently patched. I also did not publish low hanging fruits as they make you look silly in the eyes of your peers.

Over the past years I had the chance to audit and test a lot of critical infrastructures that, amongst other things relied on security products (and on security notifications from vendors) and have witnessed various ways of setting up your defenses that make some bugs critical that you'd consider low at first glance, I came to the conclusion that most bugs deserve disclosure.

Please see "Common misconceptions" for more information.

**I. Background**

Clam AntiVirus is an open source (GPL) anti-virus toolkit for UNIX, designed especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways. It provides a number of utilities including a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command line scanner and advanced tool for automatic database updates. The core of the package is an anti-virus engine available in a form of shared library.

**II. Description**

The parsing engine can be bypassed by manipulating RAR archive in a "certain way" that the Clamav engine cannot extract the content but the end user is able to. Details are currently witheld (thanks to IBM).

**III. Impact**

The bug results in denying the engine the possibility to inspect code within the RAR archive. While the impact might be low client-side (as code is inspected upon extraction by the user) the impact for gateways or AV infrastructure where the archive is not extracted is considerable. There is no inspection of the content at all, prior disclosure therefore referred to this class of bugs as Denial of service (you deny the service of the scan engine for that file) however I choose to stick the terms of evasion/bypass, being the primary impact of these types of bugs.

Below is a simplified logic of an Anti-Virus engine (Source: F-Secure - [Link](http://www.tml.hut.fi/Opinnot/T-110.6220/2008/T-110.6220-Antivirus_engine_design.pdf)), as shown below the logic breaks once the file can't be extracted.

PS. I am aware that there are hundreds of ways to bypass, that however doesn't make it less of a problem. I am waiting for the day where the first worm uses these techniques to stay undetected over a longer period of time, as depending on the evasion a kernel update (engine update) is necessary and sig updates do not suffice. Resulting in longer window of exposure - at least for GW solutions. \*Must make confiker reference here\*

**IV. Common misconceptions about this "bug class"**

* This has the same effect as adding a password to a ZIP file

The scanner denotes files that are passworded, an example is an E-mail Gatewayscanner that adds "Attachment not scanned" to the subject line or otherwise indicates that the file was not scanned. This is not the case with bypasses, in most cases the engine has not inspected the content at all or has inspected it in a different way. Additionally passworded archive files are easily filterable by a content policy, allowing or denying them.

* - This is only an issue with gateway products

Every environment where the archive is not actively extracted by the end-user is affected. For example, fileservers, databases etc. pp. Over the years I saw the strangest environments that were affected by this type of "bug". My position is that customers deserve better security than this.

* Behavioral analysis will catch this ?

No, the content is unreadable to the AV engine as such no inspection whatsoever is possible.

* Evasions are the Cross Site scripting of File formats bugs

Yes.

**IV. Disclosure timeline**

IBM was sent two POC files, an explanation and the disclosure terms (http://blog.zoller.lu/2008/09/notification-and-disclosure-policy.html)

* 09/03/2009 : Send proof of concept, description the terms under which I cooperate and the planned disclosure date (23/03/2009)
* 13/03/2009 : Clamav responds that the bug is reproducible and will be fixed in 0.95 to be released the (23/03/2009)

* 23/03/2009 : Ask clamav if the release was made and if credit was given

* 23/03/2009 : Clamav responds that the release was made, and that the credit was given in the changelog. (Tzo note: A post will be probably be made at http://www.clamav.net/category/security/

* 02/04/2009 : Release of this limited detail advisory
