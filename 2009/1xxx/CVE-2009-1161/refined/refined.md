      "rootCause": "Path traversal vulnerabilities occur when an application uses external input to construct a file path, without proper validation of the input. This can allow an attacker to access or modify files outside of the intended directory by using sequences like \"../\".",

        "attackVectors": [
           "By manipulating file paths with directory traversal sequences such as \"../\".",
           "By including null characters in pathnames to truncate the path before access restrictions are enforced."
