Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-1214:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `screen` utility creates the `/tmp/screen-exchange` temporary file with world-readable permissions. This allows other local users to read the contents of the file, potentially exposing sensitive session information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure file permissions:** The default creation of `/tmp/screen-exchange` with world-readable permissions (0666) allows unauthorized users to access its contents.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** Local users can potentially obtain sensitive session information by reading the `/tmp/screen-exchange` file.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** An attacker must have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **File read:** The attacker would need to read the `/tmp/screen-exchange` file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the same system where `screen` is being used.
- No special privileges are needed to read a world-readable file.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability stems from the intended functionality of `/tmp/screen-exchange` as a "public accessible screen-exchange file" for sharing data between users on the same host.
- The issue was initially reported in Ubuntu and Debian, leading to fixes in those distributions.
- Red Hat initially rated the issue as low impact, but later assigned CVE-2009-1214.
- The Debian fix involved properly handling umask and preventing symlink attacks.
- There was a debate about whether the world-readable permission was intended behavior for this public exchange file, but the consensus was that the file should have more restrictive permissions by default.
- Some discussions mention a race condition involving symlink attacks (covered by CVE-2009-1215) that is related to file creation and checks.

**CVE-2009-1215** is also mentioned in the content, which relates to a race condition allowing symlink attacks, but the primary issue related to CVE-2009-1214 is the insecure world-readable file permission.
