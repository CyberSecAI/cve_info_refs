    "CVE-2009-1681": {
        "Description": "A design issue exists in the same-origin policy mechanism used to limit interactions between websites. This policy allows websites to load pages from third-party websites into a subframe. This frame may be positioned to entice the user to click a particular element within the frame, an attack referred to as \"clickjacking\". A maliciously crafted website may be able to manipulate a user into taking an unexpected action, such as initiating a purchase. This update addresses the issue through adoption of the industry-standard 'X-Frame-Options' extension header, that allows individual web pages to opt out of being displayed within a subframe.",
        "Root cause": "A design flaw in the same-origin policy mechanism used by WebKit.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Inadequate protection against clickjacking attacks."
        ],
        "Impact": "A malicious website can trick a user into unintended actions by overlaying a hidden iframe on top of a legitimate one. This can lead to actions like unauthorized purchases, changing user settings, or other unwanted activities.",
        "Attack vector": "A user visits a maliciously crafted webpage.",
         "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a webpage with an iframe pointing to a target website and overlay it in a way that user interaction with the iframe results in unintended actions on the target website."
