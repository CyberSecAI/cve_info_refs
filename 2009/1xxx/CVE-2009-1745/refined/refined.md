The provided content does not relate to CVE-2009-1745. It describes multiple vulnerabilities in Armorlogic Profense Web Application Firewall 2.4, specifically:

*   **Whitelist/positive model bypass (CVE-2009-1594):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The WAF's positive model (whitelist) can be bypassed using a URL-encoded newline character. The multi-line pattern matching logic incorrectly flags a request as legitimate when it contains a newline, even if malicious content is also present.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inadequate input validation and flawed pattern matching logic in positive security model.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject various attacks, including XSS, SQL Injection, and remote command execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a request with a URL-encoded newline character and malicious payload.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests.

*   **Blacklist/negative model bypass (CVE-2009-1593):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The WAF's default negative model (blacklist) rules can be bypassed by injecting extra characters into the JavaScript closing tag.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient blacklist rules, allowing evasion through HTML/JavaScript flexibility.
    *    **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject XSS.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a request containing malicious javascript with extra characters in the close tag.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests.
*   **Static root password exposes administrative interface:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The WAF uses a default, static root password hash across all installations. SSH is enabled by default and accepts root authentication using this credential.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Hardcoded credentials, lack of unique or randomly generated password for admin interface.
    *   **Impact:** If the default password is leaked, attackers can gain access to administrative interfaces.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploitation of a leaked default password via SSH access to the administrative interface.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Knowledge of the default password, network access to administrative interface.
