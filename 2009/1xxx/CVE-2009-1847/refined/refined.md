Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-1847

**Vulnerability Description:** The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in Easy Px 41 CMS version 09.00.00B1.

**Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input to the `fiche` parameter within the URL, allowing an attacker to include local files via directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The application's vulnerability allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not sanitize the `fiche` parameter, allowing directory traversal characters like `../` and null bytes `%00`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, or database credentials.
*   **Possible Remote Code Execution:** In some scenarios, this could be escalated to remote code execution if the included file contains PHP code.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the affected application, specifically targeting the `fiche` parameter.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The attacker uses `../` sequences in the `fiche` parameter to navigate up the directory structure and access arbitrary files.
*   **Null Byte Injection:** A null byte (`%00`) is used to terminate the file path, preventing the application from appending unwanted extensions or paths.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:**  While not strictly required, knowledge of the target filesystem, in particular the location of sensitive files, is helpful to maximize the impact of the exploit.

**Exploit Example:**
The provided exploit URL in the content shows how the vulnerability can be triggered:
```
/[path]/?view=LivreDor&fiche=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
```
This demonstrates how the `fiche` parameter can be manipulated to read the `/etc/passwd` file from the server.
