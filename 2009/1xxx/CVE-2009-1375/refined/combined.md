How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Pidgin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200905-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Pidgin might allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-im/pidgin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.6** |

### Background

Pidgin (formerly Gaim) is an instant messaging client for a variety of
instant messaging protocols.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin:

* Veracode reported a boundary error in the "XMPP SOCKS5 bytestream
  server" when initiating an outgoing file transfer (CVE-2009-1373).
* Ka-Hing Cheung reported a heap corruption flaw in the QQ protocol
  handler (CVE-2009-1374).
* A memory corruption flaw in
  "PurpleCircBuffer" was disclosed by Josef Andrysek
  (CVE-2009-1375).
* The previous fix for CVE-2008-2927 contains a
  cast from uint64 to size\_t, possibly leading to an integer overflow
  (CVE-2009-1376, GLSA 200901-13).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted messages or files using
the MSN, XMPP or QQ protocols, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application,
or a Denial of Service. NOTE: Successful exploitation might require the
victim's interaction.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Pidgin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/pidgin-2.5.6"
```

## Details

It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle certain malformed

messages when sending a file using the XMPP protocol handler. If a user

were tricked into sending a file, a remote attacker could send a specially

crafted response and cause Pidgin to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary

code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-1373](/security/CVE-2009-1373))

It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle certain malformed

messages in the QQ protocol handler. A remote attacker could send a

specially crafted message and cause Pidgin to crash. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2009-1374](/security/CVE-2009-1374))

It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle certain malformed

messages in the XMPP and Sametime protocol handlers. A remote attacker

could send a specially crafted message and cause Pidgin to crash.

([CVE-2009-1375](/security/CVE-2009-1375))

It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle certain malformed

messages in the MSN protocol handler. A remote attacker could send a

specially crafted message and possibly execute arbitrary code with user

privileges. ([CVE-2009-1376](/security/CVE-2009-1376))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin and the
libpurple library:

* A participant to the TippingPoint ZDI reported multiple integer
  overflows in the msn\_slplink\_process\_msg() function in the MSN protocol
  implementation (CVE-2008-2927).
* Juan Pablo Lopez Yacubian is credited for reporting a use-after-free
  flaw in msn\_slplink\_process\_msg() in the MSN protocol implementation
  (CVE-2008-2955).
* The included UPnP server does not limit the size of data to be
  downloaded for UPnP service discovery, according to a report by Andrew
  Hunt and Christian Grothoff (CVE-2008-2957).
* Josh Triplett discovered that the NSS plugin for libpurple does not
  properly verify SSL certificates (CVE-2008-3532).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted messages or files using
the MSN protocol which could result in the execution of arbitrary code
or crash Pidgin. NOTE: Successful exploitation might require the
victim's interaction. Furthermore, an attacker could conduct
man-in-the-middle attacks to obtain sensitive information using bad
certificates and cause memory and disk resources to exhaust.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Pidgin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/pidgin-2.5.1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : pidgin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1373 CVE-2009-1375 CVE-2009-1376

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin, a graphical
multi-protocol instant messaging client. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-1373

    A buffer overflow in the Jabber file transfer code may lead to
    denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-1375

    Memory corruption in an internal library may lead to denial of
    service.

CVE-2009-1376

    The patch provided for the security issue tracked as CVE-2008-2927
    - integer overflows in the MSN protocol handler - was found to be
    incomplete.

The old stable distribution (etch) is affected under the source package
name gaim. However, due to build problems the updated packages couldn't
be released along with the stable version. It will be released once the
build problem is resolved.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.3-4lenny2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=500491#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-05-12 22:05:36 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way Pidgin's PurpleCircBuffer object is expanded.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
