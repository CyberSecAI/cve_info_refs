  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1635",
    "description": "Novell GroupWise WebAccess is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits due to unfiltered style expressions and insufficient script blocking. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, potentially redirecting users, forwarding data, and defacing the login page.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and filtering of user-supplied data, specifically in style expressions and script handling within Novell GroupWise WebAccess. The application fails to block or sanitize malicious javascript code and unfiltered style expressions allowing it to be interpreted by a users browser.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unfiltered style expressions.",
      "Inadequate script blocking, allowing malicious script execution.",
	  "Lack of sanitization of user-supplied data."
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation can lead to:\n  - Redirection of users to malicious sites.\n  - Forwarding of user data and requests to malicious destinations.\n  - Defacement of the login page, potentially denying access to legitimate users.\n  - Gaining access to an authenticated user's mailbox.",
    "attack_vector": "Attackers send crafted messages (e.g. HTML email) containing malicious scripts or style expressions that, when rendered in a user's browser via GroupWise WebAccess, execute their malicious code.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send emails or otherwise inject malicious code into the GroupWise WebAccess environment. This requires the ability to send crafted HTML emails to targeted users or manipulate web requests. No special access is needed beyond this ability."
