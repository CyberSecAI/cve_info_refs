# Pidgin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200905-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities in Pidgin might allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-im/pidgin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.5.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.5.6** |

### Background

Pidgin (formerly Gaim) is an instant messaging client for a variety of
instant messaging protocols.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin:

* Veracode reported a boundary error in the "XMPP SOCKS5 bytestream
  server" when initiating an outgoing file transfer (CVE-2009-1373).
* Ka-Hing Cheung reported a heap corruption flaw in the QQ protocol
  handler (CVE-2009-1374).
* A memory corruption flaw in
  "PurpleCircBuffer" was disclosed by Josef Andrysek
  (CVE-2009-1375).
* The previous fix for CVE-2008-2927 contains a
  cast from uint64 to size\_t, possibly leading to an integer overflow
  (CVE-2009-1376, GLSA 200901-13).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted messages or files using
the MSN, XMPP or QQ protocols, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application,
or a Denial of Service. NOTE: Successful exploitation might require the
victim's interaction.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Pidgin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/pidgin-2.5.6"
```

# USN-781-1: Pidgin vulnerabilities

3 June 2009

Pidgin vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [pidgin](/security/cves?package=pidgin) -

## Details

It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle certain malformed

messages when sending a file using the XMPP protocol handler. If a user

were tricked into sending a file, a remote attacker could send a specially

crafted response and cause Pidgin to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary

code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-1373](/security/CVE-2009-1373))

It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle certain malformed

messages in the QQ protocol handler. A remote attacker could send a

specially crafted message and cause Pidgin to crash. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2009-1374](/security/CVE-2009-1374))

It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle certain malformed

messages in the XMPP and Sametime protocol handlers. A remote attacker

could send a specially crafted message and cause Pidgin to crash.

([CVE-2009-1375](/security/CVE-2009-1375))

It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle certain malformed

messages in the MSN protocol handler. A remote attacker could send a

specially crafted message and possibly execute arbitrary code with user

privileges. ([CVE-2009-1376](/security/CVE-2009-1376))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.04

* [pidgin](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin)
  -
  [1:2.5.5-1ubuntu8.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin/1%3A2.5.5-1ubuntu8.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [pidgin](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin)
  -
  [1:2.5.2-0ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin/1%3A2.5.2-0ubuntu1.2)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [pidgin](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin)
  -
  [1:2.4.1-1ubuntu2.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pidgin/1%3A2.4.1-1ubuntu2.4)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Pidgin to effect

the necessary changes.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1805-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
May 22, 2009                          <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : pidgin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1373 CVE-2009-1375 CVE-2009-1376

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin, a graphical
multi-protocol instant messaging client. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-1373

    A buffer overflow in the Jabber file transfer code may lead to
    denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-1375

    Memory corruption in an internal library may lead to denial of
    service.

CVE-2009-1376

    The patch provided for the security issue tracked as CVE-2008-2927
    - integer overflows in the MSN protocol handler - was found to be
    incomplete.

The old stable distribution (etch) is affected under the source package
name gaim. However, due to build problems the updated packages couldn't
be released along with the stable version. It will be released once the
build problem is resolved.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.3-4lenny2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

# USN-781-2: Gaim vulnerabilities

3 June 2009

Gaim vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [gaim](/security/cves?package=gaim) -

## Details

It was discovered that Gaim did not properly handle certain malformed

messages when sending a file using the XMPP protocol handler. If a user

were tricked into sending a file, a remote attacker could send a specially

crafted response and cause Gaim to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary

code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-1373](/security/CVE-2009-1373))

It was discovered that Gaim did not properly handle certain malformed

messages in the MSN protocol handler. A remote attacker could send a

specially crafted message and possibly execute arbitrary code with user

privileges. ([CVE-2009-1376](/security/CVE-2009-1376))
