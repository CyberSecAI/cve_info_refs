Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-1764

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `ajax.asp` file of MaxCMS version 2.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The `id` parameter in the `ajax.asp` file is vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Access:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to access and manipulate the database. This can lead to data breaches, data modification, or even complete control over the database.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  The attacker could potentially use the database access to gain further access to the system or other related systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to `ajax.asp`. The vulnerable parameter is `id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server running the vulnerable MaxCMS application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided example doesn't indicate a need for authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
*   The provided exploit example is:
    `http://site.com/inc/ajax.asp?action=digg&id=1 and (select top 1 asc(mid(m_username,1,1)) from m_manager)=97`
*   This URL demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL code through the `id` parameter to extract data from the `m_manager` table, specifically the first character of the username.
