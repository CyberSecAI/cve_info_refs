Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1715:

**CVE-2009-1715**

*   **Root Cause:** An issue in Web Inspector allows a page being inspected to run injected script with elevated privileges.
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS). Web Inspector allows injected scripts to run with elevated privileges, enabling malicious code execution.
*   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts with elevated privileges. This may include the ability to read the user's file system and potentially other sensitive actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** A user interacts with a malicious website which is being inspected using Web Inspector.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious webpage that the victim would inspect using Web Inspector. This may require some social engineering to entice the victim to inspect the malicious page.

**Summary of Relevant Information:**

The vulnerability lies within WebKit's Web Inspector component. When a webpage is being inspected, the injected script runs with elevated privileges instead of the privileges of the webpage being inspected. This enables cross-site scripting attacks which might have the capability to read the user's file system. The fix addresses this vulnerability by ensuring scripts run with the privilege level of the inspected page.
