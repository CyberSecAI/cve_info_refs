{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection vulnerability in the webCal3_detail.asp script, specifically in the event_id parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL code. This could include usernames, passwords, or other confidential data. The attacker may also be able to modify or delete data within the database.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited through a web request to the vulnerable webCal3_detail.asp page. Specifically, by manipulating the event_id parameter."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the web server and knowledge of SQL syntax. They also need to identify the vulnerable parameter in the URL.",
     "more_details": "The provided exploit code shows the use of a UNION SELECT statement to inject SQL code. The specific injection point is the event_id parameter in the webCal3_detail.asp file. The example payload `20814+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10+from+msysobjects` demonstrates how an attacker could attempt to retrieve data from the database by exploiting the vulnerability."
