```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `_page_css`, `_page_javascript`, and `_page_content` parameters.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `format.php` file with malicious URLs in the `_page_css`, `_page_javascript`, or `_page_content` parameters.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
