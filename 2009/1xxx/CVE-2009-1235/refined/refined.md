{
  "CVE-2009-1235": [
    {
      "Root cause": "An implementation issue exists in the kernel's handling of fcntl system calls.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The kernel does not properly handle fcntl system calls, which allows for overwriting kernel memory."
      ],
      "Impact": "A local user can overwrite kernel memory and execute arbitrary code with system privileges, leading to privilege escalation.",
       "Attack vectors": "Local access",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access."
    },
    {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of the `fcntl` system call within the kernel, specifically the `HFS_GET_BOOT_INFO` command.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The kernel fails to validate parameters passed to the `fcntl` system call.",
        "Lack of bounds checking during memory modification.",
         "Incorrect usage of  `fcntl`  with the `HFS_GET_BOOT_INFO` command."
      ],
      "Impact": "A local attacker can achieve kernel-level privilege escalation, gaining complete control of the system.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local access to the vulnerable machine is required for exploitation.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system."
