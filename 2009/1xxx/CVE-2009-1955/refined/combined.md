##### **Tips**

To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"

## Packages

* [apache2](/security/cves?package=apache2) -

## Details

Matthew Palmer discovered an underflow flaw in apr-util as included in

Apache. An attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash

in Apache using a crafted SVNMasterURI directive, .htaccess file, or when

using mod\_apreq2. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS. ([CVE-2009-0023](/security/CVE-2009-0023))

Sander de Boer discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp would reuse connections when

a client closed a connection without sending a request body. A remote

attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive response data. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-1191](/security/CVE-2009-1191))

Jonathan Peatfield discovered that Apache did not process Includes options

correctly. With certain configurations of Options and AllowOverride, a

local attacker could use an .htaccess file to override intended

restrictions and execute arbitrary code via a Server-Side-Include file.

This issue affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2009-1195](/security/CVE-2009-1195))

It was discovered that the XML parser did not properly handle entity

expansion. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service via memory

resource consumption by sending a crafted request to an Apache server

configured to use mod\_dav or mod\_dav\_svn. This issue only affected Ubuntu

6.06 LTS. ([CVE-2009-1955](/security/CVE-2009-1955))

C. Michael Pilato discovered an off-by-one buffer overflow in apr-util when

formatting certain strings. For big-endian machines (powerpc, hppa and

sparc in Ubuntu), a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or

information disclosure leak. All other architectures for Ubuntu are not

considered to be at risk. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS.

([CVE-2009-1956](/security/CVE-2009-1956))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-786-1: apr-util vulnerabilities

10 June 2009

apr-util vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [apr-util](/security/cves?package=apr-util) -

## Details

Matthew Palmer discovered an underflow flaw in apr-util. An attacker could

cause a denial of service via application crash in Apache using a crafted

SVNMasterURI directive, .htaccess file, or when using mod\_apreq2.

Applications using libapreq2 are also affected. ([CVE-2009-0023](/security/CVE-2009-0023))

It was discovered that the XML parser did not properly handle entity

expansion. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service via memory

resource consumption by sending a crafted request to an Apache server

configured to use mod\_dav or mod\_dav\_svn. ([CVE-2009-1955](/security/CVE-2009-1955))

C. Michael Pilato discovered an off-by-one buffer overflow in apr-util when

formatting certain strings. For big-endian machines (powerpc, hppa and

sparc in Ubuntu), a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or

information disclosure leak. All other architectures for Ubuntu are

not considered to be at risk. ([CVE-2009-1956](/security/CVE-2009-1956))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.04

* [libaprutil1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apr-util)
  -
  [1.2.12+dfsg-8ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apr-util/1.2.12%2Bdfsg-8ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [libaprutil1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apr-util)
  -
  [1.2.12+dfsg-7ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apr-util/1.2.12%2Bdfsg-7ubuntu0.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libaprutil1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apr-util)
  -
  [1.2.12+dfsg-3ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apr-util/1.2.12%2Bdfsg-3ubuntu0.1)

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any services that use

apr-util, such as Apache or svnserve, to effect the necessary changes.

This should disable all entity expansions with expat and seems to work
correctly, though I haven't done extensive testing.

# APR Utility Library: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200907-03**

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Apache Portable Runtime Utility Library
might enable remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service or disclose
sensitive information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/apr-util** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.3.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.3.7** |

### Background

The Apache Portable Runtime Utility Library (aka apr-util) provides an
interface to functionality such as XML parsing, string matching and
databases connections.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the APR Utility
Library:

* Matthew Palmer reported a heap-based buffer
  underflow while compiling search patterns in the
  apr\_strmatch\_precompile() function in strmatch/apr\_strmatch.c
  (CVE-2009-0023).
* kcope reported that the expat XML parser in
  xml/apr\_xml.c does not limit the amount of XML entities expanded
  recursively (CVE-2009-1955).
* C. Michael Pilato reported an
  off-by-one error in the apr\_brigade\_vprintf() function in
  buckets/apr\_brigade.c (CVE-2009-1956).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a Denial
of Service (crash or memory exhaustion) via an Apache HTTP server
running mod\_dav or mod\_dav\_svn, or using several configuration files.
Additionally, a remote attacker could disclose sensitive information or
cause a Denial of Service by sending a specially crafted input. NOTE:
Only big-endian architectures such as PPC and HPPA are affected by the
latter flaw.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache Portable Runtime Utility Library users should upgrade to the
latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/apr-util-1.3.7"
```

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- dovecot12
Huge mail headers could cause dovecot to consume excessive amounts of CPU
cycles. (CVE-2010-0745)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2
- cacti
Missing input sanitation in the template export feature allowed for SQL
injection attacks (CVE-2010-1431).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.0
- java-1\_6\_0-openjdk
java-1\_6\_0-openjdk version 1.7.3 fixes serveral security issues:
- CVE-2010-0837: JAR 'unpack200' must verify input parameters
- CVE-2010-0845: No ClassCastException for HashAttributeSet constructors
if run with -Xcomp

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2013

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2013

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 128 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2013 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1525152.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=444414586251302&id=1525152.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=443859889660551&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

1. Oracle released a [Java SE Critical Patch Update](/security-alerts/javacpuapr2013.html) on April 16, 2013 to address multiple vulnerabilities affecting the Java Runtime Environment. Oracle CVE-2013-2380 refers to the advisories that are applicable to JRockit from the Java SE Critical Patch Update. The CVSS score of this vulnerability CVE# reflects the highest among those fixed in JRockit. The complete list of all vulnerabilities addressed in JRockit under CVE-2013-2380 is as follows: CVE-2013-1537 and CVE-2013-2415.
2. Fixed in all supported releases and patchsets.
3. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). It does not have any particular associated protocol. If the hosting software passes data received over the network to Outside In Technology code, the CVSS Base Score would increase to 6.8.

### Appendix - Oracle Applications

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 6 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapril2013verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the [Oracle Database](#AppendixDB) and [Oracle Fusion Middleware](#AppendixFMW) sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2013 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Releases 11i and 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2013), [My Oracle Support Note 1530756.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=444362575614217&id=1530756.1).

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1812-1                  security@debian.org

Package        : apr-util
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-0023

Apr-util, the Apache Portable Runtime Utility library, is used by
Apache 2.x, Subversion, and other applications. Two denial of service
vulnerabilities have been found in apr-util:

"kcope" discovered a flaw in the handling of internal XML entities in
the apr_xml_* interface that can be exploited to use all available
memory. This denial of service can be triggered remotely in the Apache
mod_dav and mod_dav_svn modules. (No CVE id yet)

Matthew Palmer discovered an underflow flaw in the
apr_strmatch_precompile function that can be exploited to cause a
daemon crash. The vulnerability can be triggered (1) remotely in
mod_dav_svn for Apache if the "SVNMasterURI"directive is in use, (2)
remotely in mod_apreq2 for Apache or other applications using
libapreq2, or (3) locally in Apache by a crafted ".htaccess" file.
(CVE-2009-0023)

Other exploit paths in other applications using apr-util may exist.

If you use Apache, or if you use svnserve in standalone mode, you need
to restart the services after you upgraded the libaprutil1 package.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.12+dfsg-8+lenny2.

The oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.7+dfsg-2+etch2.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your apr-util packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch
- -------------------------------

Oldstable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

The issues are with apr-util, but older Slackware releases will require a new version of the apr package as well.  More details about the issues may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0023   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1955   Here are the details from the Slackware 12.2 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/apr-1.3.5-i486-1_slack12.2.tgz:  Upgraded. patches/packages/apr-util-1.3.7-i486-1_slack12.2.tgz:  Upgraded.   Fix underflow in apr_strmatch_precompile.   Fix a denial of service attack against the apr_xml_* interface   using the "billion laughs" entity expansion technique.   For more information, see:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0023     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1955   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com?

Thanks to the friendly folks at the OSU Open Source Lab (http://osuosl.org) for donating additional FTP and rsync hosting to the Slackware project!  :-)  Also see the "Get Slack" section on http://slackware.com for additional mirror sites near you.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request: "billion laughs" attack against Apache APR

Hi, could a CVE name be allocated for this issue:

The expat XML parser is vulnerable to the "billion laughs" entity
expansion attack.  This results in a denial of service vulnerability in
any network-facing service which uses the Apache "APR-util" library's
wrapper interface for expat to parse untrusted XML documents.  The
Apache httpd WebDAV module "mod_dav" is such a service.

References:

<http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=781403&view=rev>

Affected versions:
APR-util <= 1.3.4

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
