Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-1858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue located within the JBIG2 filter of Adobe Acrobat Reader. This suggests a flaw in how the software processes and handles data encoded using the JBIG2 compression method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that the software is corrupting memory when handling JBIG2 data, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the same privileges as the user running the application. This could result in a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted PDF Files:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted PDF documents. These documents are designed to trigger the vulnerability during parsing and processing.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a user to open a malicious PDF file either from their local system or through a web browser (when automatic opening is configured).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without having physical access to the target system.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must entice or deceive the user into opening the malicious PDF document. This could be done through various means, including email attachments, web links, or compromised websites.

**Additional Details from the provided content**
- The SUSE security announcement and Gentoo advisory both list CVE-2009-1858 as a memory corruption with potential for arbitrary code execution, which was fixed by updating the acroread package to version 8.1.6.
- The US-CERT alert describes a memory corruption vulnerability with an emphasis on using crafted JBIG2 streams within the PDF files.
- The Adobe security bulletin provides updates and references to the flaw, though a specific bulletin is not provided for CVE-2009-1858.
- The Gentoo advisory notes the vulnerability was reported by the Apple Product Security Team.
- The Gentoo advisory also notes there are multiple heap-based buffer overflows related to JBIG2, which this vulnerability is included with.

In summary, CVE-2009-1858 is a memory corruption vulnerability in the JBIG2 filter of Adobe Acrobat Reader that can lead to arbitrary code execution if a user is tricked into opening a specially crafted PDF document. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely and was fixed in version 8.1.6 of Adobe Acrobat Reader.
