nss-ldapd is the name of the upstream package.  I suppose Debian and
others may package it with a package name of libnss-ldapd.

nss-ldapd is a fork of nss_ldap... I don't know enough to say how much
it differs, but for nss_ldap at least, /etc/ldap.conf should be
world-readable (or at least typically is, with no real exposure since
using non-anonymous binds to LDAP would be unusual -- at least from
everything I've seen and done with LDAP authentication).

/etc/ldap.conf has nothing to do with openldap and while the filename,
and probably file contents are the same, it sounds like libnss-ldap may
require more protection and/or be meant to run with a protected
configuration file.

It also, and someone correct me if I'm wrong, be due to the debian
package allowing someone to specify a bindpw at install and then not
protecting the file contents if someone does specify a bindpw.  With
RHEL and Fedora, there are no mechanisms to ask a user for a bindpw
(because it is not typical), so we would expect that an admin who puts a
bindpw in there for a user that is meant to be protected (i.e. something
other than an unprivileged user that suits the criteria for anonymous
binds for the purpose of obtaining certain non-privileged user
information), would also adequately protect the file when manually
setting the password.

And, if that is the case, then I would argue this is a debconf-specific
issue for this package than a general nss-ldapd-specific issue.

In fact, if you look here:

<http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/nss-ldapd/news.html#20090322>

you'll see that this is noted as a "security problem in ... the Debian
package configuration".

Package        : nss-ldapd
Vulnerability  : insecure config file creation
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: yes
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-1073
Debian Bug     : 520476

Leigh James that discovered that nss-ldapd, an NSS module for using
LDAP as a naming service, by default creates the configuration file
/etc/nss-ldapd.conf world-readable which could leak the configured
LDAP password if one is used for connecting to the LDAP server.

The old stable distribution (etch) doesn't contain nss-ldapd.

For the stable distribution (lenny) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.7.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.8.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss-ldapd package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# CVE 2009-1073

nss-ldapd before 0.6.8 uses world-readable permissions for the /etc/nss-ldapd.conf file, which allows local users to obtain a cleartext password for the LDAP server by reading the bindpw field.

Subject: libnss-ldapd: /etc/nss-ldapd.conf is created world-readable, exposing bindpw
Date: Fri, 20 Mar 2009 14:32:03 +1000
```
Package: libnss-ldapd
Version: 0.6.7
Severity: important

Hi, I believe there is a security issue with the default permissions on file /etc/nss-ldapd.conf
It is created as follows:
owner: root
group: root
mode: 644

My LDAP server requires authentication to access the posix user/group attributes,
but the clear text credentials I have provided to debconf are world-readable
when saved in this file. I suggest the following permissions as a new default:
owner: root
group: nslcd
mode: 640

I have not had time to check this in testing or unstable, but should this be
deployed to lenny as a security update? (both change the default and maybe prompt
the administrator to change the existing permissions?)

I am migrating from libnss-ldap, which has a debconf prompt to change the mode to 0600
if there's a password in it.

First bug, please don't flame too hard if I'm doing it wrong :)

Thanks for your report. This has been a TODO item in the package
configuration that has now been fixed. A patch is available here:
<http://arthurenhella.demon.nl/viewvc/nss-ldapd/nss-ldapd/debian/libnss-ldapd.postinst?r1=795&r2=813>

It changes permissions to 600 if the package is installed with a
password in it or if it's reconfigured width dpkg-reconfigure.

Additionally this patch:
<http://arthurenhella.demon.nl/viewvc/nss-ldapd/nss-ldapd/man/nss-ldapd.conf.5.xml?r1=805&r2=806>
mentions setting proper permissions in the manual page.

I will contact the security team to see if an updated package for lenny
is needed (will update this bug accordingly).

After discussing this with the Debian security team I will make a
slightly different solution that would always set the permissions of the
file so that it is no longer world-readable.

I will prepare an updated package.

Closes: [520476](bugreport.cgi?bug=520476)
Changes:
 nss-ldapd (0.6.8) unstable; urgency=high
 .
   * SECURITY FIX: the nss-ldapd.conf file that is installed was created
                   world-readable which could cause problems if the bindpw
                   option is used
                   this has been fixed and warnings have been added to the
                   manual page and sample nss-ldapd.conf (closes: #[520476](bugreport.cgi?bug=520476))
   * clean the environment and set LDAPNOINIT to disable parsing of LDAP
     configuration files (.ldaprc, /etc/ldap/ldap.conf, etc)
   * remove sslpath option because it wasn't used
   * correctly set SSL/TLS options when using StartTLS
   * rename the tls_checkpeer option to tls_reqcert, deprecating the old name
     and supporting all values that OpenLDAP supports
   * allow backslashes in user and group names execpt as first or last
     character
   * check user and group names against LOGIN_NAME_MAX if it is defined
   * fix for getpeercred() on Solaris by David Bartley
   * debian/control: change section to admin to follow change in override file
   * add lintian override for missing shlibs and symbols control files (we are
     a shared library that should not be directly linked to)
   * upgrade to standards-version 3.8.1 (no changes needed)
   * upgrade to debhelper compatibility level 7

So, the various bug reports and followups list:

  libnss-ldapd
  nss_ldap
  nss-ldapd
  openldap

Which package is actually affected and what versions might they be?

Use CVE-2009-1073, to be filled in once I have some more detail.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
