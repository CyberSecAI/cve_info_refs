- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$_GET["sn"]`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi). The `sn` parameter in the `index.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection. The code retrieves the `sn` parameter from the GET request and directly inserts it into an SQL query: `$sql="select sn,pagename,linktext,pagecontent,metakeywords,metadescription from $content where sn='$sn'";`. No input sanitization or escaping is performed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, allowing them to:
    - Extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords (hashes), and potentially other private data.
    - Modify data within the database.
    - Potentially gain further access to the server depending on database privileges and configuration.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `sn` parameter in the `index.php` file's GET request. The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing SQL code in the `sn` parameter, such as: `http://[HOST]/[HOME_PATH]/index.php?sn=1%27+AND+0+UNION+ALL+SELECT+1,database(),3,user(),5,6/*`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server and has to be aware of the vulnerable parameter. No special privileges are needed. The attacker can be remote.
