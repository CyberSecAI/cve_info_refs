            "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing CCD/IMG files within UltraISO.",

                "Buffer overflow"
            ],
            "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by opening a specially crafted CCD or IMG file in UltraISO. The exploit provided also notes an access violation in MagicISO when using the malicious CCD file.",

                "Opening a malicious CCD or IMG file."
            ],
