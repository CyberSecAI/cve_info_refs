{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A local buffer overflow vulnerability exists in eXeScope 6.50 due to insufficient bounds checking when processing specially crafted executable files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite the instruction pointer (EIP) and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to create a malicious executable file and have the victim user open this file using eXeScope 6.50.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious executable file and have a local user open it using the vulnerable software."
