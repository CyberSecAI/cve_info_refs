Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1406:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw in the `cms_detect.php` file of TotalCalendar 2.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `include` parameter in the HTTP request is directly used to construct a file path without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically the code lines `Line 26 : $include = isset($_REQUEST['include']) ? $_REQUEST['include'] : null;` and `Line 115 : if(!empty($include)) require_once($inc_dir.$include);` within `cms_detect.php` show the direct use of the user-supplied `include` parameter.
- **Path Traversal:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the webserver process has access to. This could include sensitive configuration files, application source code, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:**  The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request containing the malicious `include` parameter to the vulnerable script (`cms_detect.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the location of the `cms_detect.php` script within the application.

**Technical Details (from exploit-db.com):**
- Vulnerable Code Snippet in `cms_detect.php`:
    ```php
    Line 26 : $include = isset($_REQUEST['include']) ? $_REQUEST['include'] : null;
    Line 115 : if(!empty($include)) require_once($inc_dir.$include);
    ```
- Proof of Concept (PoC) URL:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1/[path]/cms_detect.php?include=../../../../../../BOOTSECT.BAK
    ```
    This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can include a system file (`BOOTSECT.BAK` in this example) using path traversal.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit information from exploit-db.com provides a clear description of the vulnerability and a proof-of-concept, which is more detailed than the typical CVE description.
- The identified vulnerable file `cms_detect.php` and the method of exploitation are valuable for understanding and remediating the issue.
