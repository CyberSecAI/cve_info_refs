# USN-770-1: ClamAV vulnerability

4 May 2009

ClamAV vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)

## Packages

* [clamav](/security/cves?package=clamav) -

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the clamav-milter initscript which caused the

ownership of the current working directory to be changed to the 'clamav'

user. This update attempts to repair the incorrect ownership for standard

system directories, but it is recommended that the following command be

performed to report any other directories that may be affected:

$ sudo find -H / -type d -user clamav ! -group clamav 2>/dev/null

Systems configured to run clamav as a user other than the default 'clamav'

user will need to adjust the above command accordingly.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.04

* [clamav-milter](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/clamav)
  -
  [0.95.1+dfsg-1ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/clamav/0.95.1%2Bdfsg-1ubuntu1.2)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: clamav-milter

A clean install of clamav-milter (0.95.1+dfsg-1ubuntu1.1) causes the root directory to become owned by the clamav user.

This was witnessed breaking ssh chroot environment.

TEST CASE:

- purge any existing clamav-milter installation, make sure you don't have any old /etc/init.d/clamav-milter init script around

- check root directory's owner (should be root:root)

- sudo apt-get install clamav-milter (the last one in Jaunty is 0.95.1+dfsg-1ubuntu1.1)

- after installing the package, clamav-milter will start automatically (at least 'init.d/clamav-milter start' will execute)

- check the root directory's owner:

root@utest-jj:/# stat /

  File: `/'

  Size: 4096 Blocks: 8 IO Block: 4096 directory

Device: 801h/2049d Inode: 2 Links: 23

Access: (0755/drwxr-xr-x) Uid: ( 110/ clamav) Gid: ( 0/ root)

Access: 2008-05-06 13:11:06.000000000 +0300

Modify: 2009-04-24 17:50:17.000000000 +0300

Change: 2009-04-27 15:30:07.000000000 +0300

Notice how it changed to clamav:root, this shouldn't happen.

Scratch that... I've just did a --purge on all clamav packages in Jaunty, chown'ed back the root and etc directories to root, and reinstalled clamav-milter 1.1 from -proposed and after that from the main repo (1ubuntu1), but nothing happened, there was no chown'ing of /root or /etc to clamav. Except for the /none file, but that comes from the postinst script.

I also tried to redo the logrotate steps, by running the logrotate on the broken clamav-milter config, nothing happened either.

Matt, if you could add a clear test case to this, if and how it can be reproduced so I can check it again, that would be great.

There is a proposed fix for this uploaded to the ubuntu-clamav PPA:

[https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-clamav/+archive/ppa/](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-clamav/%2Barchive/ppa/)

Once it's built, please test and let us know if it solves the problem for you.

AFAIK the clamav-milter init script was rewritten in Jaunty a bit so it shouldn't affect packages in the other releases. I've checked current packages in Intrepid and Hardy and they don't have this problem. Checked the following:

intrepid-proposed: 0.94.dfsg.2-1ubuntu0.5

intrepid-security: 0.94.dfsg.2-1ubuntu0.3

hardy-backports: 0.94.dfsg.2-1ubuntu0.3~hardy3

The clamav-milter init will chown "." to be owned by clamav. For normal system start, that is "/". If anyone runs the init from a different directory, that directory will get chown'ed.

Run the default synaptic package handler as root from the menu system-- running something as root starts the process in the root directory not in the logged on users directory as I understand it.

This caused the /home/username folder to become owned by clamav. I'm not sure if it was the clamav-milter script although that was part of the broad ubuntu upgrade. This resulted in not being able to boot into standard gnome desktop. Gnome failsafe allows boot where you can take back ownership as the user you log on with and the problem is solved. In this case there was no ownership changes on the root (/) folder.

As far as I can tell by looking at the process tree, Synaptic gets run with gksu. When you click on it in the System menu, you need to enter your password, so it can run as root.

But! it is run by the user, from the user's home directory, and that doesn't change. You can check this by opening Synaptic, then in a terminal switching to root, doing a 'ps ax | grep synaptic', looking up the process ID (pid), cd'ing into /proc/<pid>, and doing a 'ls -la cwd' (which links to the current working directory), this should be /home/<user>.

Thanks for that clarification I should have checked it first. The default and hence most likely way of running Synaptic will yield the users home directory problem and synaptics running with root powers from the user home might limit system-wide damage perhaps.

Yes I see but why would someone run first as root? after maybe about 1999 or so protocol was to operate the workstation/server as a user and that's also ubuntu's default set up.. I was also wondering why an install script or other program would have to take over the ownership of any directory I mean what would be the reason this isn't the first time something like this has happened I've even seen them give critical directories world rw permissions.. some sort of poorly conceived post install processing phase perhaps.

In this case the init script makes sure that the directory for the pid file

exists and is owned by the clamav user (this is necessary). The bug is

that the variable that defines the path to it is incorrectly left unset, so

"." gets chown'ed instead of /var/run/clamav.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
