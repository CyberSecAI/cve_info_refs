Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `AlbumId` parameter in the `index.php` file of the RTWebalbum application. This parameter is directly used in a SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. This means the attacker cannot directly see the results of the injected SQL queries, but can infer information based on the application's response (e.g., whether an image title is displayed or not).
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Credentials Theft:** The attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including the admin's password hash.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** By obtaining the admin credentials, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application's administration panel.
    *   **Data Breach:** Exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability could lead to a full database compromise.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php`, where the `AlbumId` parameter is manipulated with SQL injection payloads.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how SQL injection works to craft malicious queries.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit targets RTWebalbum version 1.0.462, and potentially earlier versions.
*   The exploit includes a Perl script that automates the password hash extraction using the blind SQL injection.
*   The exploit utilizes the fact that the application displays a specific HTML element (`<div id="descrp">`) when a condition in the injected SQL query is true, thus enabling the blind SQL injection.
*   The vulnerability was reported and a patch was released in version 1.0.574
