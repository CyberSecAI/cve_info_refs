How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1764-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
April 07, 2009                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : tunapie
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1253 CVE-2009-1254

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Tunapie, a GUI frontend
to video and radio streams. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-1253

    Kees Cook discovered that insecure handling of temporary files may
    lead to local denial of service through symlink attacks.

CVE-2009-1254

    Mike Coleman discovered that insufficient escaping of stream
    URLs may lead to the execution of arbitrary commands if a user
    is tricked into opening a malformed stream URL.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.3.1-1+etch2. Due to a technical problem, this update cannot
be released synchronously with the stable (lenny) version, but will
appear soon.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.8-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your tunapie package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 alias lenny
- --------------------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

# tunapie using os.system on unsanitized strings retrieved from Internet

Bug #314591 reported by
[Mike Coleman](https://launchpad.net/~tutufan)
on 2009-01-07

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: tunapie

While trying out tunapie (which is written in Python), I noticed an error message from the shell (I believe) mentioning something about mismatched quotes. I didn't save the message, unfortunately, but it did inspire me to look a bit at the source.

It appears that os.system is being called on (unsanitized) strings, parts of which are retrieved from web sites. The risk may be somewhat mitigated by the fact that only apparently a couple of well-know sites are hit (not sure about this), but still this seems like an excessive risk.

An initial improvement would be to rewrite the code without os.system, preferably using Python 2.4's new subprocess module (with shell=False) instead. The calls to os.spawnv might also be a problem--I'm not sure. (I'm not that crazy about the 'rm -fr' either.)
