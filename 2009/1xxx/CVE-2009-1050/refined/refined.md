Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-1050:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Insecure Cookie Handling:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application sets a cookie ("identifyYourself") upon successful login. However, this cookie is not cryptographically secured or validated on subsequent requests.
    *   **Weakness:** The application trusts the client-supplied cookie without verifying its authenticity.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious user can manually set the "identifyYourself" cookie to a specific value, thus bypassing the login authentication.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker only needs to be able to modify the cookies in their browser.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the login mechanism and gain unauthorized access to the application.

2.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application directly includes user-supplied data in a SQL query without sanitization. The `id` parameter in the URL `articleCall.php` is used in the SQL query without proper escaping.
    *   **Weakness:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `id` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be logged in (after exploiting the cookie bypass vulnerability) and be able to craft specific HTTP GET requests with the malicious SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.
    *    **Impact of Exploitation:** This allows an attacker to read arbitrary data from the database, potentially including sensitive information. The provided example demonstrates reading the contents of `/etc/passwd`, demonstrating file system access using the `load_file()` function available within the SQL context.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable application is identified as "Bloginator V1A".
*   The exploit examples provided show how an attacker would leverage both the cookie bypass and SQL injection flaws to gain access and extract sensitive information.
*   The identified issues are in the file `articleCall.php`.
*   The code snippets provided show that the application is vulnerable due to missing input validation and sanitization.
