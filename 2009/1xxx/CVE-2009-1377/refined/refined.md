{
  "CVE-2009-1377": {
    "description": "The dtls1_buffer_record function in ssl/d1_pkt.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8k and earlier 0.9.8 versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large series of \"future epoch\" DTLS records that are buffered in a queue, aka \"DTLS record buffer limitation bug.\"",
    "root_cause": "The `dtls1_buffer_record` function in OpenSSL does not limit the number of DTLS records buffered when they arrive with a future epoch.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unbounded memory allocation"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by exhausting the server's memory by sending a large number of crafted DTLS records with future epoch values, which are buffered without limit.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network attack"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to send network traffic to the vulnerable service.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability resides in the DTLS implementation of OpenSSL. The attack involves sending packets with future epoch values that are then buffered by the server. Without a limit on the size of this buffer, the attacker can force the server to exhaust its memory resources by repeatedly sending these packets. The fix involves adding a limit to the size of the buffer that stores these future epoch DTLS records, preventing memory exhaustion attacks."
