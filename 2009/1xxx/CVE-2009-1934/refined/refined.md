Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-1934:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
- It exists within the Sun Java System Web Server 6.1 Reverse Proxy Plug-in.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability. This means that the web server's reverse proxy plug-in does not properly sanitize user input before reflecting it back in the response. This can allow a malicious user to inject arbitrary scripts into the webpage, which are then executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary scripts. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of websites
    - Phishing attacks
    - Redirection of users to malicious websites
    - Stealing user credentials and other sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through the reverse proxy plug-in. This likely happens through manipulating parameters or headers that are then reflected in the server's responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable web server, specifically targeting the reverse proxy functionality.
- The attacker would require knowledge of the specific injection points to craft an effective attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is identified as Sun Alert Notification 259588.
- Avaya states that no Avaya system products use a Sun Microsystems Operating System with Sun Java System Web Server 6.1. However, the vulnerability itself is within the Sun Java System Web Server 6.1 reverse proxy plugin.
- The advisory mentions that more information may be found on the Sunsolve website, but may require a maintenance contract to view.
