{
  "CVE-2009-1832": {
    "Description": "The possible arbitrary execution of code was discovered via vectors involving \"double frame construction.\"",
    "Root cause": "A double frame construction vulnerability occurs when a binding with multiple insertion points reframes a containing block, leading to multiple frame creation for other kids, potentially causing memory corruption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Double frame construction",
        "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution due to potential memory corruption.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted web page with XBL binding and multiple insertion points"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into visiting a crafted webpage."
