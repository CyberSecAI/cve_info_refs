Bernd Jendrissek discovered a potentially exploitable crash when viewing
a multipart/alternative mail message with a text/enhanced part.
(MFSA 2009-33)

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-0lenny1.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported mail client.

For the testing (squeeze) distribution these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=503568#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-06-01 18:33:41 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, Alexander Sack, Bret McMillan, Tomeo Vizoso, Matt McCutchen, and Martijn Wargers reported crashes in the Firefox 3 browser engine.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=503568#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 22:46:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1095.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=503568#c3)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 23:18:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1096 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1096.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=503568#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-06-16 02:17:37 UTC  ``` firefox-3.0.11-1.fc10, xulrunner-1.9.0.11-1.fc10, epiphany-2.24.3-7.fc10, epiphany-extensions-2.24.3-2.fc10, blam-1.8.5-11.fc10, devhelp-0.22-9.fc10, galeon-2.0.7-11.fc10, gecko-sharp2-0.13-9.fc10, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-31.fc10, gnome-web-photo-0.3-19.fc10, google-gadgets-0.10.5-7.fc10, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc10.3, Miro-2.0.3-5.fc10, mozvoikko-0.9.5-11.fc10, mugshot-1.2.2-10.fc10, pcmanx-gtk2-0.3.8-10.fc10, perl-Gtk2-MozEmbed-0.08-6.fc10.2, ruby-gnome2-0.18.1-5.fc10.3, yelp-2.24.0-10.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=484031#c0)• 16 years ago |
|  | |

Testcase is attached. You might need to download it locally due to bugzilla's attachment URI thing, but it'd work on any web server.
The basic idea is to have a binding with two insertion points; one of these needs to be an inline and the other needs to be a descendant of the inline's containing block. The we force a ContentAppended with at least two nodes after the binding has been attached (the testcase uses a script that blocks the parser and spins the event queue using sync XHR until the binding has been attached). The first node has block display and goes into the inline insertion point; the others go into the other insertion point.
Since there are multiple insertion points, the frame constructor converts the ContentAppended call into a sequence of ContentInserted calls. The first ContentInserted sticks a block inside the inline insertion point, which reframes the containing block. After that we already have frames for all the other kids, and their ContentInserted calls end up double-creating the frames. The testcase just uses a single doubled kid: a textnode that uses the text "Doubled", which shouldn't be crashy. But it could easily toss in iframes, image frames, etc, and cause various trouble.
Possible solutions I see:
1) Do a GetPrimaryFrameFor before doing ContentInserted in this case. That
would also bite fieldsets, since those claim multiple insertion points, but
might be ok.
2) If a node has a binding with multiple insertion points (including nested
ones, etc), never add more than one child at a time to it; notify after
each child.
#2 is hard to do with our current parser; not sure about Henri's parser. And in any case, we'd need it for both XHTML and HTML (the page could be HTML if it just linked to a separate XBL file).
Thoughts?

This doesn't trigger the doubling with Firefox 3 or my 1.9.0 build for some reason. I thought that had incremental XML parsing, and it certainly has the relevant frame construction code...
In any case, it does trigger doubling with 1.9.1 builds and trunk.

If the condition of #2 (node having a binding with multiple insertion points) expensive to find out on a per-insertion basis?
The relevant methods are the two methods starting here:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/users/mrbkap_mozilla.com/html5parsing/file/ad080d04a0e5/content/html/parser/src/nsHtml5TreeBuilderHSupplement.h#l86>
If would be a matter of the first calling the second conditionally. Thus, easy to do, but the effect depends on how expensive the check is.

Probably somewhat expensive, yes. I'm tempted to go with #1, since it's more reliable and guarantees that we only take a perf hit in the multiple insertion point case...

Probably, yes. Given what will happen if I stick an animated image in as the doubled node, the right rating is sg:critical.

Er, maybe not. That won't guarantee that we leak the frame, come to think of it. So we still need a rating, but we might be closer to ok than I thought, esp. with some of smaug's changes to subdocument frames.

[Fix](attachment.cgi?id=369742&action=diff) (obsolete)

Let's just fix this. I realized that the GetPrimaryFrameFor() check is cheap in the common case (the case when we don't double content), due to the MAY\_HAVE\_FRAME flag and due to this being ContentAppended for multiple nodes (so it's coming from the parser, basically, hence these nodes definitely should not have MAY\_HAVE\_FRAME set).

This should work unless the node's frame gets suppresed (e.g. whitespace inside a table row or some such). Not sure what we can do about that case, but "double-constructing" there should be safe enough in any case.

Is there any way to verify this fix for 1.9.0? As mentioned above, the attached testcase doesn't cause any issues with 1.9.0.10.

Probably, yes. Start with the attached testcase and modify it to trigger the relevant code on 1.9.0... That might involve some debugging to figure out why it doesn't right now. I didn't think that was worth it.

> Boris, does this affect 1.8.1?
I'd be very very surprised if not. That said, I'm not sure nothing else along these lines does, so I'm not sure how worth it it is to fix it there.

Attached patch

[1.8 patch](attachment.cgi?id=383226&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=383226&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=484031&attachment=383226)

Updated patch for 1.8 although I can't confirm it fixes the bug on 1.8. The testcase acts the same way with and without the patch.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=503569#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-06-01 18:37:02 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Boris Zbarsky reported a method to trigger double frame construction which could lead to memory corruption.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=503569#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 22:46:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1095.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=503569#c3)  Fedora Update System    2009-06-16 02:17:41 UTC  ``` firefox-3.0.11-1.fc10, xulrunner-1.9.0.11-1.fc10, epiphany-2.24.3-7.fc10, epiphany-extensions-2.24.3-2.fc10, blam-1.8.5-11.fc10, devhelp-0.22-9.fc10, galeon-2.0.7-11.fc10, gecko-sharp2-0.13-9.fc10, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-31.fc10, gnome-web-photo-0.3-19.fc10, google-gadgets-0.10.5-7.fc10, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc10.3, Miro-2.0.3-5.fc10, mozvoikko-0.9.5-11.fc10, mugshot-1.2.2-10.fc10, pcmanx-gtk2-0.3.8-10.fc10, perl-Gtk2-MozEmbed-0.08-6.fc10.2, ruby-gnome2-0.18.1-5.fc10.3, yelp-2.24.0-10.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=503569#c0)  Josh Bressers    2009-06-01 18:37:02 UTC  ``` Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.  Boris Zbarsky reported a method to trigger double frame construction which could lead to memory corruption.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=503569#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-06-11 22:46:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2009:1095 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1095.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=503569#c3)  Fedora Update System    2009-06-16 02:17:41 UTC  ``` firefox-3.0.11-1.fc10, xulrunner-1.9.0.11-1.fc10, epiphany-2.24.3-7.fc10, epiphany-extensions-2.24.3-2.fc10, blam-1.8.5-11.fc10, devhelp-0.22-9.fc10, galeon-2.0.7-11.fc10, gecko-sharp2-0.13-9.fc10, gnome-python2-extras-2.19.1-31.fc10, gnome-web-photo-0.3-19.fc10, google-gadgets-0.10.5-7.fc10, kazehakase-0.5.6-4.fc10.3, Miro-2.0.3-5.fc10, mozvoikko-0.9.5-11.fc10, mugshot-1.2.2-10.fc10, pcmanx-gtk2-0.3.8-10.fc10, perl-Gtk2-MozEmbed-0.08-6.fc10.2, ruby-gnome2-0.18.1-5.fc10.3, yelp-2.24.0-10.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.11-0lenny1.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix several security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2009-1392, CVE-2009-1832, CVE-2009-1833, CVE-2009-1837, CVE-2009-1838,
CVE-2009-1841)

Multiple flaws were found in the processing of malformed, local file
content. If a user loaded malicious, local content via the file:// URL, it
was possible for that content to access other local data. (CVE-2009-1835,
CVE-2009-1839)

A script, privilege elevation flaw was found in the way Firefox loaded XML
User Interface Language (XUL) scripts. Firefox and certain add-ons could
load malicious content when certain policy checks did not happen.
(CVE-2009-1840)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed certain Unicode characters in
International Domain Names (IDN). If an IDN contained invalid characters,
they may have been displayed as spaces, making it appear to the user that
they were visiting a trusted site. (CVE-2009-1834)

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled error responses returned from
proxy servers. If an attacker is able to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack
against a Firefox instance that is using a proxy server, they may be able
to steal sensitive information from the site the user is visiting.
(CVE-2009-1836)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories for Firefox 3.0.11. You can find a link to the Mozilla
advisories in the References section of this errata.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Firefox version 3.0.11, which corrects these issues. After installing the
update, Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-24

## Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.0.11)

Announced
June 11, 2009
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.11
* SeaMonkey 1.1.17
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.22

### Description

Mozilla developers and community members identified and fixed
several stability bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other
Mozilla-based products. Some of these crashes showed evidence of
memory corruption under certain circumstances and we presume that with
enough effort at least some of these could be exploited to run
arbitrary code.

Thunderbird shares the browser engine with Firefox and
could be vulnerable if JavaScript were to be enabled in mail. This is
not the default setting and we strongly discourage users from running
JavaScript in mail. Without further investigation we cannot rule out
the possibility that for some of these an attacker might be able to
prepare memory for exploitation through some means other than
JavaScript such as large images.

### Workaround

Disable JavaScript until a version containing these fixes can be
installed.

### References

Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, Alexander Sack, Bret McMillan, Tomeo
Vizoso, Matt McCutchen, and Martijn Wargers reported crashes in the
Firefox 3 browser engine. Boris Zbarsky also reported a method to
trigger double frame construction which could lead to memory
corruption.
