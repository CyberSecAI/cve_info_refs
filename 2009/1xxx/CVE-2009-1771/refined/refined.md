Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-1771

**Vulnerable Software:** Flyspeck CMS 6.8

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of the `lang` parameter in the `includes/database/examples/addressbook.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local/Remote File Inclusion (LFI/RFI):** The script includes files based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization, leading to a Local File Inclusion vulnerability.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is:
    ```php
    $lang = isset($_GET['lang']) ? $_GET['lang'] : 'de'; line 28
    include "lang." . $lang . ".inc"; line 29
    ```
    This allows an attacker to manipulate the `$lang` parameter to include arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** An attacker can include local files, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. By crafting a malicious URL, an attacker could include files like `/etc/passwd` or other system files containing sensitive data.
*   **Change Password and Add Admin:** The exploit also provides a form that allows an attacker to change the administrator's password and create new admin users. This enables complete control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request targeting the vulnerable script (`includes/database/examples/addressbook.php`) with a malicious value for the `lang` parameter, such as `../../../../boot.ini%00`.
*   **Form Submission:** The attacker can submit the provided form to modify admin user credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTTP and URL manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP GET requests with modified parameters.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable application's file structure:** To exploit the LFI vulnerability, the attacker needs to be familiar with the server's directory structure to specify the path of the files to include.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit includes a null byte (`%00`) at the end of the file path, which can sometimes bypass certain file inclusion checks.
*   The exploit also provides a form to change admin passwords, suggesting this vulnerability can be exploited to gain full access to the application and the server itself.

This analysis provides more detail than the basic CVE description by outlining the specific code weakness, the method of attack, and the broader implications of exploitation, including the ability to add or modify admin users.
