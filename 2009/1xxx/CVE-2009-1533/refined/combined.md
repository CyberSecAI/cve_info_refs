## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on October 13, 2009?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to announce the addition of language localizations to the update for Works 9. The additional languages are Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Slovak, Slovenian, and Ukrainian. Works 9 was not available in these languages when this bulletin was originally released. Customers who have already successfully applied the original update to Works 9 are not affected by this revision.

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Why is this update Critical for Word 2000 but only Important for all other affected versions of Word?**

Microsoft Office Word 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.

**MS09-017 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Works 8.5 and Microsoft Works 9. How does MS09-017 relate to this bulletin (MS09-024)?**

The security update packages for Microsoft Works 8.5 (KB967043) and Microsoft Works 9 (KB967044) in this bulletin, MS09-024, also address the vulnerabilities described in [MS09-017](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=141704). Users with Microsoft Works 8.5 or Microsoft Works 9 installed will only need to install the update packages once.

**What is the Microsoft Works 6-9 File Converter?**

The Microsoft Works 6-9 Converter allows Microsoft Office Word 2003 to open, edit, and save files in the Works Word Processor file format supported by the Works versions 6, 7, 8, and 9. For more information, see [Microsoft Works 6-9 File Converter](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=bf41401e-70fa-465d-ae2e-cf44dbf05297&displaylang;=en).

**The Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system shipped with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in the version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. However, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335).

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office.

#### Workarounds for File Converter Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1533

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **For Word 2000 and Word 2002, disable the Works 4.x converter by restricting access**

  An administrator can apply an access control list to affected converters to ensure that the converters are no longer loaded by Works and Office. This effectively prevents exploitation of the vulnerability using this attack vector.

  **For Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003**

  Run the following command from a command prompt:

  ```
  cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /E /P everyone:N
  cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /E /P everyone:N

  ```

  **For** **Vista** **/ Server 2008**

  Run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  takeown /f "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv"
  icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /save works432_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /deny everyone:(F)
  takeown /f "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv"
  icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /save works432_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /deny everyone:(F)

  ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Upon implementing the workaround, the user will no longer be able to open or save Works 4.x documents. Attempting to open a Works 4.x document will return an error saying, "The file appears to be corrupted."
* **For Word 2003 with the** [**Microsoft Works 6-9 File Converter**](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=bf41401e-70fa-465d-ae2e-cf44dbf05297&displaylang;=en) **and Word 2007, disable the Works 6-9 converter by restricting access**

  An administrator can apply an access control list to affected converters to ensure that the converter is no longer loaded by Works and Office. This effectively prevents exploitation of the vulnerability using this attack vector.

  **For Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003**

  Run the following command from a command prompt:

  ```
  cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /E /P everyone:N
  cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /E /P everyone:N

  ```

  **For Windows** **Vista** **and Windows Server 2008**

  Run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  takeown /f "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv"
  icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /save works632_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /deny everyone:(F)
  takeown /f "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv"
  icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /save works632_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /deny everyone:(F)

  ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Upon implementing the workaround, the user will no longer be able to open or save Works 6-9 documents. Attempting to open a Works 6-9 document will return an error saying, "The file appears to be corrupted."

#### FAQ for File Converter Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1533

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When a user opens a specially crafted Works file, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in **Start Search**.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click on the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. Under the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.
  4. You may also click on the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.
  5. Finally, you may also click on the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on October 13, 2009?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to announce the addition of language localizations to the update for Works 9. The additional languages are Croatian, Czech, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Slovak, Slovenian, and Ukrainian. Works 9 was not available in these languages when this bulletin was originally released. Customers who have already successfully applied the original update to Works 9 are not affected by this revision.

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Why is this update Critical for Word 2000 but only Important for all other affected versions of Word?**

Microsoft Office Word 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.

**MS09-017 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Works 8.5 and Microsoft Works 9. How does MS09-017 relate to this bulletin (MS09-024)?**

The security update packages for Microsoft Works 8.5 (KB967043) and Microsoft Works 9 (KB967044) in this bulletin, MS09-024, also address the vulnerabilities described in [MS09-017](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=141704). Users with Microsoft Works 8.5 or Microsoft Works 9 installed will only need to install the update packages once.

**What is the Microsoft Works 6-9 File Converter?**

The Microsoft Works 6-9 Converter allows Microsoft Office Word 2003 to open, edit, and save files in the Works Word Processor file format supported by the Works versions 6, 7, 8, and 9. For more information, see [Microsoft Works 6-9 File Converter](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=bf41401e-70fa-465d-ae2e-cf44dbf05297&displaylang;=en).

**The Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system shipped with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in the version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. However, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335).

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

* 2007 Microsoft Office System Service Pack 2 is not affected by the vulnerability.
* Microsoft Office Word 2003 is only affected if the Works converter is installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Works 6-9 File Converter](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=bf41401e-70fa-465d-ae2e-cf44dbf05297&displaylang;=en).
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office.

#### Workarounds for File Converter Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1533

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **For Word 2000 and Word 2002, disable the Works 4.x converter by restricting access**

  An administrator can apply an access control list to affected converters to ensure that the converters are no longer loaded by Works and Office. This effectively prevents exploitation of the vulnerability using this attack vector.

  **For Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003**

  Run the following command from a command prompt:

  ```
  cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /E /P everyone:N
  cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /E /P everyone:N

  ```

  **For** **Vista** **/ Server 2008**

  Run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  takeown /f "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv"
  icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /save works432_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /deny everyone:(F)
  takeown /f "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv"
  icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /save works432_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works432.cnv" /deny everyone:(F)

  ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Upon implementing the workaround, the user will no longer be able to open or save Works 4.x documents. Attempting to open a Works 4.x document will return an error saying, "The file appears to be corrupted."
* **For Word 2003 with the** [**Microsoft Works 6-9 File Converter**](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=bf41401e-70fa-465d-ae2e-cf44dbf05297&displaylang;=en) **and Word 2007, disable the Works 6-9 converter by restricting access**

  An administrator can apply an access control list to affected converters to ensure that the converter is no longer loaded by Works and Office. This effectively prevents exploitation of the vulnerability using this attack vector.

  **For Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003**

  Run the following command from a command prompt:

  ```
  cacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /E /P everyone:N
  cacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /E /P everyone:N

  ```

  **For Windows** **Vista** **and Windows Server 2008**

  Run the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

  ```
  takeown /f "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv"
  icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /save works632_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%CommonProgramFiles%\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /deny everyone:(F)
  takeown /f "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv"
  icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /save works632_ACL.TXT
  icacls "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\works632.cnv" /deny everyone:(F)

  ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Upon implementing the workaround, the user will no longer be able to open or save Works 6-9 documents. Attempting to open a Works 6-9 document will return an error saying, "The file appears to be corrupted."

#### FAQ for File Converter Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1533

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

When a user opens a specially crafted Works file, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
