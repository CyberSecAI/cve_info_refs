Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way Novell Teaming (which uses Liferay portal) handles login attempts. It uses different text messages to report error conditions for valid and invalid usernames during login attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Username Enumeration:** The system's inconsistent error messages for failed login attempts based on whether the username is valid or not, enables attackers to identify valid usernames. This is a classic username enumeration vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation reveals valid usernames.
*   **Preparation for further attacks:** Knowing valid usernames makes brute-force attacks and targeted phishing attempts against those identified accounts more feasible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Interaction:** Attackers interact directly with the login page or authentication mechanism of the Novell Teaming application.
*   **Network-based:** Exploitation occurs over the network by sending requests to the login interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to reach the Novell Teaming login interface.
*   **Basic Knowledge of HTTP:** Attackers need to be able to craft and send login requests to observe the differences in responses based on username validity.

**Mitigation:**

The provided resolution steps involve:

1.  **Modifying Error Messages:** Changing the error messages so they are exactly the same for both valid and invalid usernames. Specifically, modifying the `authentication-failed` and `please-enter-a-valid-login` properties within the Liferay portal's configuration files.
2.  **Applying Changes:** This involves unpacking a JAR file, making the edits to properties files, repackaging the JAR, and restarting the Teaming service.

This change prevents the system from behaving differently based on username validity, closing the username enumeration vulnerability.
