  "CVE-2009-1044": {
    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.  The specific flaw exists in the XUL tree method \\_moveToEdgeShift(). In some cases this call will trigger garbage collection routines on in use objects which will result in a future call to a dangling pointer. This can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current user.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the XUL tree method `_moveToEdgeShift()` incorrectly triggering garbage collection on in-use objects, leading to a dangling pointer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Dangling pointer"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code under the context of the current user, or cause a denial of service by crashing Firefox.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote, requiring the victim to visit a malicious page.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability. No special privileges on the victim's system are needed.",
    "more_information": "The vulnerability was reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative. The exploit was used to win the 2009 CanSecWest Pwn2Own contest. Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2009/mfsa2009-13.html"
