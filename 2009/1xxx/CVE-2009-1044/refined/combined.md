## Mozilla Firefox XUL \_moveToEdgeShift() Memory Corruption Vulnerability

### ZDI-09-015ZDI-CAN-465

| CVE ID | [CVE-2009-1044](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1044) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [3.0.x](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['6947']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.  The specific flaw exists in the XUL tree method \_moveToEdgeShift(). In some cases this call will trigger garbage collection routines on in use objects which will result in a future call to a dangling pointer. This can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2009/mfsa2009-13.html> |

jst said to start with Neil. Since this is a high profile bug (Firefox cracked during a public hacking contest) we need to focus on it. If we had a fix I'd like to shoehorn it into 1.9.0.8 even though we're past codefreeze (April release) but May's 1.9.0.9 is more realistic. Needs to make 3.5b4.Assignee: nobody → enndeakinFlags: wanted1.9.0.x+Flags: blocking1.9.1?Flags: blocking1.9.0.9?Flags: blocking1.9.0.8?

Windows and OSX stacks look quite different :/
Does this crash on trunk/1.9.1?
If not, my guess is that [bug 430214](/show_bug.cgi?id=430214 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX] Don't fire events while there are scriptblockers") fixed this.
Especially this <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=348637&action=edit>
It changed nsTreeSelection::FireOnSelectHandler to asynchronous.

This sounds like memory stomping somewhere. valgrind might shed some light.

But for 1.9.0 the patch might be the safest fix - shouldn't cause regressions.

Note that I never got the PoC to crash in a debug build so the patch will have to be verified in an opt build.

So, InitWithFuncCallback is used, passing this is unsafe \*unless\*
timer is canceled before deleting this.

Tested in opt builds and this patch stops the mac crashes I was seeing (I never got a debug build to crash). Since I was seeing completely different stacks on windows I'd like to verify this there as well.

patch
Does this have to go in on trunk and branch at the same time, or can we bake it there a bit first? Either way, it's a blocker, so doesn't need a191.

I can't reproduce the crash on 1.8.1, but I don't know why.
The code is the same.
The patch applies to 1.8.1 too (just need to use --fuzz=3)

Ah, 1.8.1 doesn't seem to have [bug 362680](/show_bug.cgi?id=362680 "RESOLVED FIXED - cannot gain focus using keyboard on the only item in a tree"). So reproducing would need some
changes to the testcase.

No, MITRE assigned this based only off of the announcement from CanSecWest. If you look at the CVE id information:
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1044>
There is nothing of consequence there. It's just a placeholder.

Although the exploit doesn't affect the 1.8 branch because it uses functionality that doesn't exist there, we should take this small patch just in case there's another way to end up with a dangling selection timer.Flags: wanted1.8.1.x+Flags: wanted1.8.0.x?Flags: blocking1.8.1.next?Flags: blocking1.8.1.next+

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

firefox security update (RHSA-2009-0397)

Original Release Date: March 31, 2009

Last Revised: March 31, 2009

Number: ASA-2009-113

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the way Firefox handles XML
files containing an XSLT transform. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to crash Firefox or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user
running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-1169](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1169) to this issue.

A flaw was discovered in the way Firefox handles certain XUL garbage
collection events. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Firefox
or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2009-1044](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1044) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0397.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with firefox installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity AUDIX LX | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with section five of [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place; risk to Avaya's
product and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as a product
update is available. Further restrictions as deemed
necessary based on the customer's security policies
may be required during this interim period.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |
| AES 4.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-745-1: Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

28 March 2009

Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)
* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) -
* [firefox-3.0](/security/cves?package=firefox-3.0) -
* [xulrunner-1.9](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9) -

## Details

It was discovered that Firefox did not properly perform XUL garbage

collection. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a

remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and 8.10. ([CVE-2009-1044](/security/CVE-2009-1044))

A flaw was discovered in the way Firefox performed XSLT transformations.

If a user were tricked into opening a crafted XSL stylesheet, an attacker

could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1169](/security/CVE-2009-1169))

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2009%3A0397)

## Topic

Updated firefox packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

This update has been rated as having critical security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mozilla Firefox is an open source Web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the way Firefox handles XML
files containing an XSLT transform. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to crash Firefox or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user
running Firefox. (CVE-2009-1169)

A flaw was discovered in the way Firefox handles certain XUL garbage
collection events. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Firefox
or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.
(CVE-2009-1044)

For technical details regarding these flaws, refer to the Mozilla security
advisories. You can find a link to the Mozilla advisories in the References
section of this errata.

Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve these
issues. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, they contain backported patches to
the firefox package. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, they contain
backported patches to the xulrunner packages. After installing the update,
Firefox must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : xulrunner
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1169 CVE-2009-1044

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications, such as the Iceweasel web
browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-1169

    Security researcher Guido Landi discovered that a XSL stylesheet could
    be used to crash the browser during a XSL transformation. An attacker
    could potentially use this crash to run arbitrary code on a victim's
    computer.

CVE-2009-1044

    Security researcher Nils reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
    that the XUL tree method _moveToEdgeShift was in some cases triggering
    garbage collection routines on objects which were still in use. In such
    cases, the browser would crash when attempting to access a previously
    destroyed object and this crash could be used by an attacker to run
    arbitrary code on a victim's computer.

Note that after installing these updates, you will need to restart any
packages using xulrunner, typically iceweasel or epiphany.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version
1.9.0.7-0lenny2.

As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.8-1

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Mozilla Firefox Browser was updated to the 3.0.8 release. It
fixes two critical security issues:
MFSA 2009-13 / CVE-2009-1044: Security researcher Nils reported
via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that the XUL tree method
\_moveToEdgeShift was in some cases triggering garbage collection
routines on objects which were still in use. In such cases, the browser
would crash when attempting to access a previously destroyed object
and this crash could be used by an attacker to run arbitrary code on
a victim's computer. This vulnerability was used by the reporter to
win the 2009 CanSecWest Pwn2Own contest.
This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 2, Thunderbird 2, or
released versions of SeaMonkey.
MFSA 2009-12 / CVE-2009-1169:Security researcher Guido Landi discovered
that a XSL stylesheet could be used to crash the browser during a
XSL transformation. An attacker could potentially use this crash to
run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
This vulnerability was also previously reported as a stability problem
by Ubuntu community member, Andre. Ubuntu community member Michael
Rooney reported Andre's findings to Mozilla, and Mozilla community
member Martin helped reduce Andre's original test case and contributed
a patch to fix the vulnerability.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Restart the Firefox browser after installing the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2009-13

## Arbitrary code execution via XUL tree element

Announced
March 27, 2009
Reporter
Nils
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.0.8

### Description

Security researcher **Nils** reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that the XUL `tree`
method `_moveToEdgeShift` was in some cases triggering
garbage collection routines on objects which were still in use. In
such cases, the browser would crash when attempting to access a
previously destroyed object and this crash could be used by an
attacker to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.

This vulnerability was used by the reporter to win the
2009 CanSecWest Pwn2Own contest.

This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 2,
Thunderbird 2, or released versions of SeaMonkey.
