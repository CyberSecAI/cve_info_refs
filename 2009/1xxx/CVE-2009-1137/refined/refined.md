      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office PowerPoint handles specially crafted PowerPoint files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted PowerPoint file that could be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site.\n\nWhen PowerPoint reads sound data from specially crafted PowerPoint 4.0 files, an error may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.\n\nThis update prevents Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002 from opening PowerPoint 4.0 native file formats.",
     "vulnerability": {
        "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from how PowerPoint processes sound data within specially crafted PowerPoint 4.0 files, leading to memory corruption.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Memory corruption due to improper handling of sound data in PowerPoint 4.0 files",
           "Insufficient input validation"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and take full control of the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing, modifying, or deleting data, and creating new user accounts with full user rights. Users with fewer user rights are less impacted.",
         "attackVectors": [
          "Email attachments",
