{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper input sanitization in the `comments.php` and `admin/index.php` scripts allows for SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Blind SQL Injection in `comments.php`",
    "SQL Injection in `admin/index.php`"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information, including usernames and passwords, from the database.  In the admin area, they can modify user information.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET request to `comments.php` with a crafted `image_id` parameter",
    "HTTP GET request to `admin/index.php` with crafted `page`, `action`, and `user` parameters"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "For blind SQL injection in `comments.php`, no authentication is needed, the attacker needs to know the target application URL.",
    "For SQL injection in `admin/index.php`, the attacker needs to be logged in as administrator"
   ]
