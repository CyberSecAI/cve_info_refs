Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1617:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure cookie handling within Teraway LinkTracker v1.0. Specifically, the application does not properly validate the `twLTadmin` cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application trusts the cookie data without proper validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the `twLTadmin` cookie, an attacker can gain administrative privileges. The provided exploit demonstrates how to set the `userid` and `lvl` parameters within the cookie to `1`, which likely grants admin access to the application's menu.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Client-Side Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `twLTadmin` cookie directly within the client's browser, setting the values to grant administrative privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript within the user's browser, either through a malicious website or a successful XSS attack.
*   The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable application (e.g., `http://victim/path/menu.asp`)

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit uses the following JavaScript code to modify the cookie:
    ```javascript
    javascript:document.cookie="twLTadmin=userid=1&lvl=1;path=/";
    ```
    After setting this cookie, accessing the `menu.asp` page would grant elevated privileges to the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information suggests the vulnerability is present in Teraway LinkTracker v1.0.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as a web application vulnerability.
