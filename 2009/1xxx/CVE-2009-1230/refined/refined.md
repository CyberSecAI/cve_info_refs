RELATED: CVE-2009-1230

Vulnerability: Podcast Generator 1.1 - Remote Code Execution

Root cause:
*   `core/admin/delete.php`: Unrestricted file deletion due to missing admin rights check, allowing deletion of arbitrary files with any extension.
*   `core/admin/scriptconfig.php`: Remote code execution due to lack of sanitization of the 'recent' parameter and missing quotes when writing to the configuration file.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
*   Unauthenticated arbitrary file deletion.
*   Lack of input sanitization.
*   Remote Code Execution.

Impact of exploitation:
*   An attacker can delete arbitrary files, including configuration files.
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

Attack vectors:
1.  Delete the `config.php` file using the vulnerability in `core/admin/delete.php`.
2.  Create a new configuration using `setup/index.php` to set a known admin password.
3.  Login to the admin panel.
4.  Inject PHP code into the configuration file via the `recent` parameter in `core/admin/scriptconfig.php`.
5.  Execute the injected code by accessing the `config.php` file with a `cmd` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running Podcast Generator.
*   No authentication is needed for the initial steps.
