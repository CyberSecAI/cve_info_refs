Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is that WebKit, a web content engine, does not prevent remote websites from loading Java applets located on the local system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Unrestricted Local Resource Access:** The core weakness is the ability of a remote website to load and execute local Java applets.
-   **Lack of Origin Restriction:** WebKit doesn't enforce restrictions on where Java applets can be loaded from, allowing remote origins to access local resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the user's system by using a malicious Java applet.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker could gain elevated privileges, potentially gaining control over the user's system if the local applet has such capabilities.
-   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can use the local Java applet to obtain sensitive information from the user's local system.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Website:** An attacker would need to trick a user into visiting a website they control, which would then attempt to load the local Java applet.
-   **APPLET or OBJECT tag:** The vulnerable website would use either the `<APPLET>` or `<OBJECT>` HTML tags to load the malicious local Java applet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to host a website that the victim will visit.
-   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to lure the victim into visiting the malicious website.

**Summary of extracted information:**

The vulnerability (CVE-2009-1712) exists due to WebKit's failure to prevent remote websites from loading local Java applets. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a user's machine, escalate privileges, or gain access to sensitive local data by luring users to a malicious website. The attack vector involves the use of `<APPLET>` or `<OBJECT>` tags in the malicious website to load a locally stored Java applet that the user would not expect to be executed from a remote website.
