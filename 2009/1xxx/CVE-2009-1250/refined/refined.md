       "description": "An attacker with control of a file server or the ability to forge RX packets may be able to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode on an OpenAFS client, due to a vulnerability in XDR array decoding.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within the XDR array decoding functionality of the OpenAFS client.",
      "vulnerability": "A vulnerability in XDR array decoding allows for arbitrary code execution in kernel mode.",
