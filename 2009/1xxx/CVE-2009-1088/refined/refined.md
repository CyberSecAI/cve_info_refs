Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from Hannon Hill Cascade Server's use of the Xalan-Java XSLT processor, which allows users to write XSLT stylesheets. Because Cascade Server does not restrict the kind of XSLT code, users can inject arbitrary Java code via XSLT extension elements and functions. This Java code can then be used to execute system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted XSLT Processing:** The primary weakness is the lack of restrictions on the XSLT code that users can enter.
- **Code Injection:** The ability to inject arbitrary Java code via XSLT.
- **Command Execution:** The ability to execute arbitrary system commands via injected Java code using the `java.lang.Runtime` class.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system hosting Cascade Server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The commands are executed with the privileges of the user who started Cascade Server, which is necessarily sufficient to gain full control of Cascade Server.
- **Full Control of Cascade Server:** This allows the attacker to elevate privileges within the system, conduct denial of service attacks, and generally gain full administrative control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **XSLT Stylesheet Modification:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by creating or modifying XSLT stylesheets that contain malicious Java code.
- **XML Block Creation/Modification:** The malicious stylesheet is then associated with an XML block which allows execution during the rendering process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Unprivileged Account:** An attacker needs access to an unprivileged account within Cascade Server that has the ability to edit XSLT stylesheets or create new ones.
- **Ability to create/edit blocks/pages:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create and edit blocks, stylesheets and pages to trigger the execution of malicious code
