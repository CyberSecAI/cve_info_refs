{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection and code execution due to insecure handling of user input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection",
    "Code Execution"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database via SQL injection. Additionally, authenticated users can achieve code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET requests to vulnerable endpoints.",
     "Manipulation of 'Board Name' parameter in admin panel."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "For SQL injection, no authentication is required. For code execution, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the admin panel."
