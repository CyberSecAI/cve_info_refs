Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1659:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a combination of an authentication bypass and an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the eLitius v1.0 web application. The upload functionality does not properly validate the file type, allowing an attacker to upload a PHP file disguised as a GIF by spoofing the MIME type.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The exploit script indicates an authentication bypass is present, allowing the upload of files without proper authorization.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:**  The application allows the upload of files to a specific directory without proper type validation and sanitization, enabling an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code.
*   **MIME-Type Spoofing:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass file type restrictions by spoofing the MIME type in the upload request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The attacker can upload a malicious PHP file which can be used to gain a shell on the server. This provides a direct path to system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, utilizing HTTP POST and GET requests. The attacker crafts a multipart/form-data POST request to upload a malicious PHP file by spoofing its mime type as image/gif. Once the file is uploaded, the attacker can execute arbitrary code by sending HTTP GET requests to the uploaded file with the desired commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable web application over HTTP.  The attacker does not require any prior authentication or credentials.

**Additional details:**
The provided exploit code demonstrates how to upload a PHP file with a GIF extension to the `admin/banners` directory and subsequently execute arbitrary system commands by accessing the uploaded file. The script performs the following steps:
1.  Crafts a malicious PHP payload disguised as a GIF using MIME-type spoofing.
2.  Sends an HTTP POST request to `admin/uploadimage.php` with the crafted payload to upload the malicious file.
3.  If upload is successful, the attacker can send HTTP GET requests with the `gnk` parameter to the uploaded file (`banner_ditails.php`) to execute arbitrary system commands via `passthru($_GET["gnk"]);`.
