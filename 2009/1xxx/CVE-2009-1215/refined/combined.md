| [Thu 02 Apr 2009 03:28:09 PM UTC, comment #6:](#comment6) Quote  Ok, so the debian folks created a security hole which they have to fix. Not our issue, though.   If you set the screen exchange files to something different than the "public" file, you should make sure that it's not a public writeable directory. The same is true for all files screen writes, like screen dumps. $(HOME)/screen-exchange would be a good idea.   IMHO the debian folks should just put      bufferfile $HOME/screen-exchange  in their /etc/screenrc file and not mess with the source.   Regarding the symlink attack: yep, but that's really theoretical. Maybe we should use O\_NOFOLLOW where available. | [Michael Schröder <mls>](/users/mls) Group administrator |
| [Thu 02 Apr 2009 02:44:39 PM UTC, comment #5:](#comment5) Quote  One thing you may be missing is Debian bug:    <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=433338>   Which resulted in addition of the following:   +/\*\*  + \* I consider this 'public exchange file' feature a bad idea, at least  + \* if this is the default case. I really don't like the idea of an admin  + \* copying configuration file snippets around that might get changed  + \* in that buffer file.  + \* Drop the notion of a 'public' exchange file. If someone explictly wants  + \* to share his copy buffer contents, he is free to chmod it after its  + \* creation.  + \* Jan Nordholz <hesso@pool.math.tu-berlin.de>, 2007/08/07         public = !strcmp(fn, DEFAULT\_BUFFERFILE);  + \*/   This was to avoid having exchange file with permission 0666, but accidentally introduced symlink issue for default exchange file, as the checks are less strict for non-public exchange files.   Thinking more about this, even without this change, one can possibly shoot himself in the foot by setting bufferfile to some non-default value, that is in a world-writeable directory (e.g. /tmp or /var/tmp).  So the file will be treated as non-public, and fewer checks will be done before opening/creating it.   There also seem to be a **theoretical** race between lstat and open in the public code path.  If attacker unlinks his screen-exchange file, victim creates new file on same filesystem, it may get the same dev/inode number as the original attacker's screen-exchange.  If attacker symlinks it, test comparing lstat and fstat output may succeed, even the file is different.  All those steps (unlink, create, symlink) need to happen in between lstat and open, while the attacker does not have a control over "create" and the created file is not likely to be a valuable target. | [Tomas Hoger <thoger>](/users/thoger) |
| [Wed 01 Apr 2009 12:21:02 PM UTC, comment #4:](#comment4) Quote  I really don't see a security issue:   1) The code in question opens the file just with O\_WRONLY, thus it is neither created (missing O\_CREAT) nor changed (missing O\_TRUNC). Afterwards it is made sure that the file is the same as returned in the previous lstat().  2) The other path uses O\_EXCL|O\_CREAT to make sure that a new file is created  3) mode 666 is only used for the "public" file used for collaboration. If you don't like that behavior, just change the file to $HOME/.screen-exchange. Screen will not use mode 666 in that case.   But maybe I'm missing something else? | [Michael Schröder <mls>](/users/mls) Group administrator |
| [Sun 11 Jan 2009 08:11:44 PM UTC, comment #3:](#comment3) Quote  I don't know about any new use cases. I don't think this is anything to do with what the intended use cases are anyway (except that the original use case renders (a) not a bug, AFAICT).   If I understand correctly, the point is that if screen is susceptible to symlink attacks, then someone could set up /tmp/screen-exchange as a symlink to /usr/bin/ssh (say), and screen would happily overwrite the real /usr/bin/ssh (if screen is setuid root) with, say, a shell script that logs passwords. Or even just delete a sensitive write-protected file somewhere. | [Micah Cowan <micahcowan>](/users/micahcowan) |
| [Sun 11 Jan 2009 05:06:29 PM UTC, comment #2:](#comment2) Quote  /tmp/screen-exchange was intended to be an exchange buffer for multiple users working on the same machine.   Therefore we implemented:  a) a predictable filename  b) a world read/write-able file.   Apparently it now used for different purposes. Unfortunatly, documentation was not very clear about the intended use case.  It only indicates once that we have a 'public accessible screen-exchange file'. | [Juergen Weigert <jnweiger>](/users/jnweiger) Group administrator |
| [Sun 11 Jan 2009 06:19:39 AM UTC, comment #1:](#comment1) Quote  The Ubuntu bug: <[https://bugs.launchpad.net/screen/+bug/315993](https://bugs.launchpad.net/screen/%2Bbug/315993)> | Anonymous |
| [Sun 11 Jan 2009 06:14:45 AM UTC, **original submission:**](#comment0) Quote  The code responsible for the error does: open("/tmp/screen-exchange", O\_WRONLY, 0666);   (a) the file is created with default permissions, depending on the user umask value, which means world-readable under default install settings  (b) Symlink attack is possible. There used to be a race condition, but it seems it was removed when #433338 was closed, as the fix didn't really fix the problem. Now there is no race condition, and any pre-existing symbolic link will result in a file overwrite/creation.   I have created a patch that fixes the problem. The changelog shows three previous patches related to /tmp/screen-exchange. I have commented the source so that future readers can understand better what is going on, and there is hopefully no regression.   I have tested the patched version, and it works under all conditions. The patch applies with an offset to current Debian unstable version (4.0.3-11), and I can only presume it would work.   The patch is against the Ubuntu package, manual merge will need to be done against the upstream, because it is applied over the Debian and Ubuntu patches. | Anonymous |

# Insecure creation of /tmp/screen-exchange (symlink attack)

Bug #315993 reported by
[Jan Minář](https://launchpad.net/~rdancer)
on 2009-01-11

### Bug Description

1) The release of Ubuntu you are using, via 'lsb\_release -rd' or System -> About Ubuntu.

$ lsb\_release -rd

Description: Ubuntu 8.04.1

Release: 8.04

2) The version of the package you are using, via 'apt-cache policy packagename' or by checking in Synaptic.

$ apt-cache policy screen

screen:

  Installed: 4.0.3-7ubuntu1

  Candidate: 4.0.3-7ubuntu1

  Version table:

 \*\*\* 4.0.3-7ubuntu1 0

        500 <http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com> hardy/main Packages

        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status

3) What you expected to happen

/tmp/screen-exchange should be created in a secure manner. In particular:

(a) The file should be readable and writable only to the owner (fix for #433338 didn't really fix it, and instead changed the race condition into no-race, making the issue worse)

(b) Symlink attack should be impossible

4) What happened instead

The code responsible for the error does: open("/tmp/screen-exchange", O\_WRONLY, 0666);

(a) the file is created with default permissions, depending on the user umask value, which means world-readable under default install settings

(b) Symlink attack is possible. There used to be a race condition, but it seems it was removed when #433338 was closed, as the fix didn't really fix the problem. Now there is no race condition, and any pre-existing symbolic link will result in a file overwrite/creation.

I have created a patch that fixes the problem. The changelog shows three previous patches related to /tmp/screen-exchange. I have commented the source so that future readers can understand better what is going on, and there is hopefully no regression.

I have tested the patched version, and it works under all conditions. The patch applies with an offset to current Debian unstable version (4.0.3-11), and I can only presume it would work.

This is documented behaviour:  <http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Documentation/Gnu/screen-3.9.4/html_node/screen_82.html#SEC82>  In particular:  Command: writebuf     (C-a >)     Writes the contents of the paste buffer to a public accessible screen-exchange file. This is thought of as a primitive means of communication between screen users on the same host. See also C-a ESC (see section 12.1 Copying).  I read this as a means of data transfer between different screen users which implies that it must be world readable.  And since it also indicates that it's a means of communication *between* users (implying back-and-forth), then it must be world writable as well.  Granted, it may not be the most secure thing on the planet, and may not be documented as a security risk, but from what I read above this should be expected behaviour.  The upstream report seems to indicate the same thing.  It might be of concern if screen was suid root, but it isn't; it's sgid screen.  The /tmp/screen-exchange file is also created with the ownership of the user who first creates it, so at *best* it could be used to overwrite your own files.  And another user cannot remove the file on your behalf and create a symlink because the file is in /tmp which has the sticky bit set, so user A can't remove user B's /tmp/screen-exchange even if it is mode 0666.  Finally, the reporter's proposed patch would be to make the file securely using mode 0600.  I would argue that if you do not want this file to be created and used in the documented way, you could set the buffer file to something in your home directory using ~/.screenrc and the bufferfile configuration keyword.  Unless I'm missing something, this shouldn't even be considered a bug.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=492104#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2009-04-02 12:18:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=492104#c6)) > <http://sunsite.ualberta.ca/Documentation/Gnu/screen-3.9.4/html_node/screen_82.html#SEC82>  [...]  > I read this as a means of data transfer between different screen users which > implies that it must be world readable.  And since it also indicates that it's > a means of communication *between* users (implying back-and-forth), then it > must be world writable as well.  Ok, this rules out [CVE-2009-1214](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1214) as non-issue, as the permissions are intended to be that way.  Though [CVE-2009-1215](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2009-1215) may still be a (fairly minor) issue, if the exchange file is not created correctly.  > The /tmp/screen-exchange file is also created with the ownership of the user > who first creates it, so at *best* it could be used to overwrite your own > files.  And another user cannot remove the file on your behalf and create a > symlink because the file is in /tmp which has the sticky bit set  The case you are forgetting is user B creates symlink pointing to some user A's file, that should be corrupted.  Then B convinces A to use this exchange feature.  If pre-created symlink can trick screen to destroy A's file, it can be a problem.  However, screen does not seem to allow that.  Briefly explained in upstream bugreport:   <http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?25296#comment4>  few more details here.  Relevant code if is in WriteFile() / fileio.c.  417       exists = !lstat(fn, &stb); 418       if (public && exists && (S_ISLNK(stb.st_mode) || stb.st_nlink > 1)) 419         { 420           Msg(0, "No write to links, please."); 421           return; 422         }  Exchange file is lstat-ed first.  If it is symlink, or non-symlink with multiple hardlinks, screen gives an error and nothing gets written to exchange file.  If file does not exist at the time of lstat (or lstat fails for some other reason), the code path used leads to open with O_CREAT | O_EXCL, not allowing link attack:  402           if (exists) [ ... ] 450           else 451             fd = open(fn, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, 0666); 452           f = fd >= 0 ? fdopen(fd, mode) : 0;  So the only case that remains is that lstat succeeds and an attacker tries to race against screen in between lstat and open.  At lstat time, attacker-controlled exchange file must exist and must not be link.  Regular file would do.  Open is done with O_WRONLY and returned file descriptor is fstat-ed and checked against previous lstat output.  Device numbers and inodes are compared.  404       if ((fd = open(fn, O_WRONLY, 0666)) >= 0) 405         { 406           if (fstat(fd, &stb2) == 0 && stb.st_dev == stb2.st_dev && stb.st_ino == stb2.st_ino) 407             ftruncate(fd, 0); 408           else 409             { 410               close(fd); 411               fd = -1; 412             } 413         }  During that race, attacker needs to replace regular file with hard or symbolic link.  For hard link, the device / inode number check will fail for any file that existed before A used this copy to exchange file feature.  (In theory, A's file created after B unlinks his exchange file but before A's screen calls open can be targeted, but this is actually a double race with B not really being able to control whether some other file is created by A at the right time.)  Symlink case is similar.  fstat does not stat B's symlink, but rather an A's target file.  Device / inode check should only succeed for A's file created somewhere in between the mentioned double race.  As noted above, this feature it not the most secure thing on the planet, but I wouldn't expect it to be used very often (I'm screen user myself and I've never heard of it before ;).  It's probably not much that can be done to improve this (possibly pre-create the exchange file as root and make it world or screen group writable, this would likely require it's move from /tmp to /var), but it's not really worth treating as security flaw that may require backporting fixes to already released versions of screen.  Launchpad bug also refers to other Debian bug that reportedly changes this code in some way, so this may not apply to Debian/Ubuntu version of screen.  This analysis should apply to all screen versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4 and 5, and current Fedora versions (9, 10), where we do not seem to divert from upstream in any way.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=492104#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2009-04-02 14:38:55 UTC  ``` Ah, I see the Debian change now, it comments out following line:   public = !strcmp(fn, DEFAULT_BUFFERFILE);  Due to that, /tmp/screen-exchange is treated as "private", i.e. it does not have 666 permissions set, but also all anti-symlink attack tests are skipped as well.  Similar can be re-created by setting bufferfile option to something in /tmp, but not the default name.   ``` |  |

Hi,

Based on the bug report[1] in Ubuntu, /tmp/screen-exchange is still being
created unsafely (lacks O_CREAT|O_EXCL, has a race, etc).  Upstream has a
report open[2] as well.

Changes:
 screen (4.0.3-13) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * Sync with Ubuntu, closes: #[520359](bugreport.cgi?bug=520359). New dpatches:
     * 33increase_max_winmsg_renditions
     * 35screen_invoked_with_a_command (cherry-picked from upstream)
   * Bump Standards version to 3.8.1 (again, no changes).
   * Accommodate initscript to adjust the $SCREENDIR permissions
     correctly even if /usr/bin/screen is installed 0755.
     Add a Q&A pair to README.Debian to clarify this problem.
     Closes: #[520317](bugreport.cgi?bug=520317).
   * Fix #433338 properly by keeping the umask instead of dropping
     the 'public exchange file' concept. Modify dpatch 22.
     Addresses [CVE-2009-1214](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1214), [CVE-2009-1215](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1215), closes: #[521123](bugreport.cgi?bug=521123).
   * Depend on patch-stamp instead of patch in debian/rules.
     (Phony targets as intermediates in a dep chain are braindead.)
   * Fix job control and CTTY handling on our new kfreebsd archs.
     Closes: #[522689](bugreport.cgi?bug=522689). Thanks to Axel Beckert for his support!
