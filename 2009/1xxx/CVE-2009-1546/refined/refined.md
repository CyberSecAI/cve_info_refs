Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2009-1546:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in how the Windows component processes AVI files. Specifically, the component fails to properly validate data within specially crafted AVI files, leading to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow vulnerability within the AVI file processing component (avifil32.dll).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **System Compromise:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control of the system, enabling them to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Denial of Service:** On some systems the vulnerability could lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious AVI file:** An attacker can craft a malicious AVI file that exploits the integer overflow.
- **Email:** The attacker can send the malicious AVI file to a user, attempting to convince the user to open the file.
- **Web-based attack:** The attacker can host a website with malicious content (including the AVI file) that triggers the vulnerability if visited.
- **Compromised Websites:** Malicious content may also be placed on websites or ad servers used by the victim.
- **File System:** On Windows Vista and Server 2008, the vulnerability could be triggered by a user browsing to a directory containing a malicious AVI file, since the explorer will attempt to process the file to display a preview.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious AVI file to the victim.
- The attacker would have to persuade the victim to open or otherwise process the malicious file (e.g., through email, a malicious website, or a file system location).
- No user interaction is needed on Windows Vista and Server 2008 to trigger exploitation. The preview rendering will trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects how AVI files are processed by the operating system, and is independent of the Windows Media Player version installed.
- Workarounds include denying access to `avifil32.dll` or removing a specific registry entry, though these impair functionality (AVI rendering/previews).
- The severity is rated as critical for most systems, although on some configurations it is rated important and leads to denial of service
