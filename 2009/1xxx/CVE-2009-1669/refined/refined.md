Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1669:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Smarty template engine's math handler did not properly sanitize backtick characters, which allows for execution of shell commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Input Handling:** The `function.math.php` plugin in Smarty didn't filter backtick characters in the math handler, enabling command injection.
*   **Code Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject shell commands through the `math` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary shell commands on the server running the vulnerable Smarty application.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a full compromise of the web server, including access to sensitive data and further malicious activities.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** As demonstrated in the exploit, an attacker could overwrite core application files (like `index.php`) leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Service Interaction:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through a web service utilizing the Smarty template engine.
*   **Malicious Input:** Injecting backtick characters and system commands within the `math` function parameters.
*   **Template Overwriting:**  Attackers can overwrite template files with malicious code using directory traversal vulnerabilities in `boards_rss.php`, allowing code execution through the template system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the web service or application utilizing the vulnerable Smarty version.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Understanding of how to manipulate HTTP requests is needed to inject the malicious code.
*   **User Account (for some attack vectors):** Some attack vectors like injecting code through the user's "display name" require an account to be registered on the target system.
*   **No authentication (for some attack vectors):** Directory traversal vulnerability and overwriting files through  `boards_rss.php` don't require an account.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit code mentions a secondary vulnerability where backticks in math equations can be used for command execution even on Windows systems. This was due to a lack of sanitization within the math functionality.
*   The vulnerability also includes a directory traversal issue in the `boards_rss.php` script, allowing the attacker to write files outside of the intended directory.
*   The exploit demonstrates several attack vectors including remote code execution, file overwriting, and template injection.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited to bypass short_open_tag protections by injecting php code into template files.
*   The exploit uses the `HTTP_CMD` header to pass the command, and it can overwrite files in the webserver directory.
