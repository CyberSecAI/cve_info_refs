Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-1086:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the ldns library. Specifically, it occurs due to an insufficient buffer boundary check within the RR (Resource Record) DNS record parser of the ldns library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability. When parsing a specially crafted DNS record, the library fails to properly check the boundaries of a buffer, leading to data being written past the allocated memory. This can overwrite other parts of memory, causing crashes or potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most critical impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By crafting a malicious DNS record, an attacker could potentially overwrite memory with their own code and execute it.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Even if arbitrary code execution is not achieved, the buffer overflow can cause a crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Scope of Compromise**: The scope will vary depending on how ldns is used. The vulnerability can present either a local or remote attack vector.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious DNS Record:** The attack vector involves a maliciously crafted DNS resource record (RR) with an overly long class and/or TTL field being parsed by the vulnerable ldns library.
*   **Network based**: A remote attacker can send a specially crafted DNS response to a server using the vulnerable library to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Send Malicious DNS Data:** The attacker needs the capability to supply the vulnerable library with a malicious DNS record. This could be done either by a remote attacker via a network, or by a local attacker if the application processes locally crafted DNS records.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Stefan Kaltenbrunner.
*   The issue is present in versions of `ldns` prior to 1.4.0-1+lenny1 (for Debian stable) and 1.5.1-1 (for Debian unstable).
*   The fix involves applying proper bounds checking when parsing DNS records, preventing the overflow.
