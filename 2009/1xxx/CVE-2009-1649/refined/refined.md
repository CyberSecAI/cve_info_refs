Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-1649

**Vulnerable Software:** beLive v0.2.3

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. This means that the application allows an attacker to include local files on the server through user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `arch` parameter of the `arch.php` file, allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences like `../../` to navigate the file system.
*  **Lack of Input Validation**: The application does not validate or sanitize the input it receives for the 'arch' parameter, which allows an attacker to manipulate the path used to include files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Local File Disclosure:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive configuration files, source code, and other potentially confidential data. This information could be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `arch.php` with a manipulated `arch` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit is achieved by crafting a URL such as:
`http://[page].pl/belive/arch.php?arch=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00`
This URL leverages path traversal (`../`) to navigate to the root directory and then accesses the `/etc/passwd` file. The `%00` null byte is sometimes used to terminate the string and bypass security checks.

**Summary**
The beLive 0.2.3 application is vulnerable to a local file inclusion vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in the `arch.php` script. This allows a remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `arch` parameter.
