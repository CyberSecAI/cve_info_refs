{
  "CVE-2009-1890": {
    "root_cause": "The HTTP proxy module (mod_proxy_http), when used as a reverse proxy, does not properly handle requests containing more data than stated in the Content-Length header.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of Content-Length in reverse proxy mode"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by forcing the proxy process to consume excessive CPU time.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted HTTP requests with a Content-Length header specifying a smaller size than the actual request body."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server acting as reverse proxy."
  }
