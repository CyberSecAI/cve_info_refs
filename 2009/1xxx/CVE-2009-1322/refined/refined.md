  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ASP Product Catalog application is vulnerable to both Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and database disclosure.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the search functionality.",
    "Database disclosure vulnerability due to direct access to the database file."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser (XSS) or download the application's database (database disclosure).",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "XSS: By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `keywords` parameter of the search.asp page.",
    "Database disclosure: By directly requesting the database file `database/aspProductCatalog.mdb`."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special capabilities are needed besides this."
