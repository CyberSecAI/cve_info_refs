Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Blind SQL Injection** flaw in the `com_agoragroup` component of Joomla.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The component does not properly sanitize user input passed via the `id` parameter in the `groupdetail` action.
*   This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
*   The injection is "blind" because the application doesn't directly output the results of the injected query, but the attacker can infer information by observing the application's behavior (e.g., timing differences, presence/absence of data).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to access sensitive information from the database.
*   The provided examples demonstrate the ability to extract usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table.
*   With further exploitation, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data, or potentially escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable Joomla component.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `id`, which is part of the URL: `index.php?option=com_agoragroup&con=groupdetail&id=[INJECTED_SQL]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Joomla application.
*   No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to know (or guess) the vulnerable component name and the vulnerable parameter.
*   The attacker requires knowledge of SQL syntax and blind injection techniques.
*   A web browser or a tool capable of crafting HTTP requests (like `curl` or similar) can be used to conduct the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit examples show how to extract the username and password from the database.
*   The vulnerable component is `AgoraGroup` version `0.3.5.3`.
*   The exploit is a **remote** web application vulnerability.
