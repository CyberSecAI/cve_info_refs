    {
      "cve": "CVE-2009-1488",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_7255aae0_20250124_183259.html",
      "root_cause": "The application has multiple vulnerabilities including authentication bypass and Local File Inclusion.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL injection vulnerability in the login form by injecting `PEPE' OR 1=1 /*` as username.",
        "Insecure cookie handling: The application uses cookies for authentication, and a user can log in by setting a `user` cookie.",
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI): The `module` parameter in admin/load.php allows to include arbitrary files via directory traversal."
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication, log in as any user and perform file inclusion attacks to read sensitive files on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By crafting a malicious username and password to bypass authentication via SQL injection.",
         "By setting a cookie `user=1` or `user=pepe' or 1=1 /*` to bypass login.",
        "By crafting a malicious URL using the `module` parameter to read arbitrary files via LFI."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. For LFI, they also need to be an admin user."
