{
  "CVE-2009-1888": {
    "description": "In the smbd daemon, if a user is trying to modify an access control list (ACL) and is denied permission, this deny may be overridden if the parameter \"dos filemode\" is set to \"yes\" in the smb.conf and the user already has write access to the file.",
    "vulnerability": "The smbd daemon in Samba incorrectly handled permissions to modify access control lists when dos filemode is enabled.",
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this to modify access control lists.",
    "attack_vector": "Remote",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user that already has write access to the file in question.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "Ubuntu 8.10",
      "Ubuntu 9.04",
      "Samba 3.0.31 to 3.3.5 (inclusive)"
