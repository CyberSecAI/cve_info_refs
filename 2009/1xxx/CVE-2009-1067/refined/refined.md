Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2009-1067:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper handling of the `x` URL parameter in Pixie CMS's blog functionality. The value of this parameter, intended to hold blog post titles, is directly inserted into the HTML `<body>` tag without proper sanitization.
*   **SQL Injection:** Lack of sanitization of the `referer` HTTP header in the `referral()` function within Pixie CMS's logging mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The application fails to sanitize or validate user-supplied input, both in the form of URL parameters and HTTP headers.
*   **Lack of Output Encoding:** The application doesn't encode output before rendering it in the browser, leading to XSS.
*   **SQL Injection Vulnerability:** Failure to sanitize user-controlled input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the page, potentially leading to:
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Session hijacking/cookie theft.
    *   Defacement of the website.
    *   Phishing attacks.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, which may result in:
    *   Data manipulation or deletion.
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Privilege escalation if the application database user is too powerful.
    *   Complete compromise of the application and potentially the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** By manipulating the `x` URL parameter in blog post URLs.
*   **SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `referer` HTTP header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** The attacker can be unauthenticated. Requires the ability to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting it or embedding the malicious URL in a site.
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker can be unauthenticated. Requires the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details (from Exploit-DB content):**

*   The XSS vulnerability is located in the `index.php` file, specifically line 150, where the `x` variable is used within the `<body>` tag.
*   The SQL injection vulnerability exists in `/admin/lib/lib_logs.php`, line 31, where the `referer` header is processed.
*   The exploit examples in the exploit-db entry demonstrates how to use a crafted `referer` to alter the pixie_log table and how to redirect users with a crafted `x` parameter.

In summary, Pixie CMS is vulnerable to both XSS and SQL injection due to inadequate input sanitization and output encoding.
