Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1184:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content from multiple sources (Debian, Ubuntu, LWN, Openwall, Launchpad) confirms that CVE-2009-1184 relates to a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's SELinux subsystem when `compat_net` is enabled.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from a coding error in the `selinux_ip_postroute_iptables_compat` function within `security/selinux/hooks.c`.
   - When `compat_net=1` was set, this function omitted crucial calls to `avc_has_perm` for checking permissions on the network *node* and *port*.
   - This omission meant that network traffic could bypass the intended SELinux access control restrictions.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Missing Access Control Checks:** The core weakness lies in the absence of permission checks for node and port access when the deprecated `compat_net` option was used. This bypass negates the security measures SELinux was intended to enforce.
   - **Deprecated Code:** The vulnerability was present within deprecated compatibility code that was intended for older systems, which highlights the risks of maintaining legacy features in security-sensitive code.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - **Bypass Network Restrictions:**  A local user could bypass SELinux's network traffic restrictions.
    - **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** While the primary impact is the bypass, this could potentially lead to privilege escalation if combined with other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    - **Loss of Security:** The vulnerability undermines the security guarantees provided by SELinux.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
    - **`compat_net` Enabled:** The system must have the deprecated `compat_net` parameter set to `1`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Local User:** An attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute commands.
    - **SELinux Aware:** The attacker would need to be aware of how SELinux works and the specific vulnerability in `compat_net`.

**Additional Notes from Content:**
    - **Fix:** The vulnerability is fixed in Linux kernels 2.6.27.22 and 2.6.28.10 (and later). The vulnerable code was removed from 2.6.30.
    - **Debian:** Debian security advisory DSA-1800-1 addressed this vulnerability along with other issues.
    - **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu also released a patch addressing the vulnerability with USN-793-1.
    - **Openwall:** Openwall reported the skipped checks issue related to `compat_net=1`.
    - **Patch:** The fix involved correcting the conditional logic in the `selinux_ip_postroute_iptables_compat` function, ensuring that `avc_has_perm` was always called for node and port checks even with `compat_net=1`, or removing the code entirely.
    - **Incorrect Reporting:** The Launchpad entry clarifies that the vulnerability was incorrectly reported as being fixed in 2.6.27.21, and the actual fix was in 2.6.27.22.
    - **Mitigation:** If `compat_net` is set to `0`, this vulnerability cannot be exploited since the new secmark-based packet controls are used.

In summary, CVE-2009-1184 exposed a flaw in SELinux due to a missing permission check within deprecated network compatibility code. This vulnerability allowed a local attacker to bypass intended network restrictions, highlighting the importance of removing or carefully maintaining legacy code paths.
