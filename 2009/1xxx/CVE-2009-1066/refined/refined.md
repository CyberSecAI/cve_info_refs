The provided content is related to CVE-2009-1066.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Pixie CMS is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unsanitized user input in the `x` URL parameter.
- Pixie CMS is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized data from the `referer` client request header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XSS:** The `x` parameter, intended to contain blog post titles, is directly outputted into the HTML `<body>` tag without sanitization, allowing for injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **SQL Injection:** The `referer` header is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query within the `referral()` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker can manipulate the SQL query, potentially leading to data modification, unauthorized access, or complete database compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **XSS:** By crafting a malicious URL with a modified `x` parameter.
- **SQL Injection:** By sending a request with a crafted `referer` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Pixie CMS instance.
- For XSS, the attacker needs to convince a user to click on a malicious link or browse a webpage embedding the malicious URL.
- For SQL Injection, no direct user interaction is required, just sending a request with a modified `Referer` header is sufficient.
