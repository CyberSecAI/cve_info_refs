# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

They're both directory traversal in WebDAV, but Microsoft recently
confirmed to me that they are distinct problems.  No other details were
provided.

## Vulnerabilities in Internet Information Services (IIS) Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (970483)

Published: June 09, 2009 | Updated: June 17, 2009

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker sent a specially crafted HTTP request to a Web site that requires authentication. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass the IIS configuration that specifies which type of authentication is allowed, but not the file system-based access control list (ACL) check that verifies whether a file is accessible by a given user. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities would still restrict the attacker to the permissions granted to the anonymous user account by the file system ACLs.

This security update is rated Important for Microsoft Internet Information Services on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that the WebDAV extension for IIS handles HTTP requests. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update addresses the vulnerability described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 971492](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/971492).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## IIS 5.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1122

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the WebDAV extension for IIS handles HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted anonymous HTTP request to gain access to a location that should require authentication.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-1122](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1122).

#### Mitigating Factors for IIS 5.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1122

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Microsoft Internet Information Services versions 5.1, 6.0, and 7.0 are not affected by this vulnerability.
* **The anonymous user account is denied write access by default**. In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability with write access, the anonymous user account would need to have write access ACLs set within the IIS folder structure. However, by default, the anonymous user account only has read access ACLs set. On IIS 6.0, there is an explicit deny access control entry (ACE) for write permissions for the default anonymous user account. Unless overridden by the administrator, this deny ACE will be inherited by all children under the default Web site root.
* **File system ACLs are enforced**. This vulnerability allows for an attacker to bypass the IIS configuration that specifies which type of authentication is allowed, but not the file system-based ACL check that verifies whether a file is accessible by a given user. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability would still restrict the attacker to the permissions granted to the anonymous user account on the file system ACL level. Therefore this vulnerability cannot be used to exceed the level of access granted to the anonymous user account through file system ACLs. The default anonymous user account is configured as the IUSR\_<computername> account.

#### Workarounds for IIS 5.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1122

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable WebDAV**

  If WebDAV functionality is not required on the server, it can be disabled.

  For IIS 5.0, WebDAV can be disabled as described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 241520](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/241520).

  **Impact of workaround.** After applying this workaround, WebDAV requests will not be served by IIS.
* **Alternate method to disable WebDAV on IIS 5.0**

  The [IIS Lockdown Tool 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=dde9efc0-bb30-47eb-9a61-fd755d23cdec&displaylang;=en) can be used to disable WebDAV as well. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 325864](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/325864).

  + To start the installation immediately, click **Open** or **Run this program from its current location**.
  + To copy the download to your computer for installation at a later time, click **Save** or **Save this program to disk**.

  **Impact of workaround.** This method achieves its results by installing [UrlScan](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/cc242650.aspx). By default, UrlScan blocks requests to WebDAV by detecting either HTTP verbs or headers that would be mapped to WebDAV. If the IIS Lockdown tool is uninstalled, UrlScan will remain. To uninstall UrlScan, unregister the UrlScan ISAPI filter from the IIS Manager snap-in.
* **Change file system ACLs to deny access to the anonymous user accoun**t

  If WebDAV functionality is required, NTFS ACLs should be used to control access to resources on the server. If resources should be inaccessible to the anonymous user through WebDAV, appropriate read or write NTFS ACLs should be applied based on desired access to that resource. For more information on setting ACLs for IIS content, see the following articles:

  + [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 271071](https://support.microsoft.com/?id=271071)
  + [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 812614](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/812614/)

  **Impact of workaround.** Applying this workaround may have adverse effects on products that require content to be accessed by the IUSR\_<computername> account. Examples of these products include System Center Configuration Manager 2007.

#### FAQ for IIS 5.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1122

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability that could allow an attacker to bypass an authentication requirement to access content on an IIS Server.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The WebDAV extension does not properly decode a specially crafted requested URL. This causes WebDAV to apply an incorrect configuration when handling the request. If the applied configuration allows anonymous access, a specially crafted request can bypass authentication. In addition, because WebDAV applies an incorrect configuration, other settings in the IIS configuration that should be applied to a particular path, such as IP address restrictions, may not be honored by WebDAV.

Note that IIS would still process such a request in the security context of the configured anonymous user account. Therefore, this vulnerability cannot be used to bypass NTFS ACLs. The restrictions imposed on the anonymous user account by file system ACLs will still be enforced.

**What is the anonymous user account?**

When Web sites and applications running on the Web server require anonymous access, IIS must be configured with a user account specifically for anonymous access. This account will then be used to access content on the file system when requested by the anonymous Web user. In a default configuration, IIS uses the anonymous user account IUSR\_<computername>, where <computername> is the name of the computer on which IIS is running. However, it is possible to change the anonymous user identity to use a different local user account or a domain user account as the anonymous user account.

**What is WebDAV?**

Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an extension to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that defines how basic file functions such as copy, move, delete and create are performed by a computer using HTTP.

**What is an access control list (ACL)?**

An access control list (ACL) is a list of security protections that applies to an object. (An object can be a file, process, event, or anything else having a security descriptor.) An entry in an ACL is an access control entry (ACE). There are two types of access control list, discretionary and system. Each ACE in an ACL identifies access rights allowed, denied, or audited for that trustee. For information, see the MSDN article, Access Control Lists.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to bypass the IIS configuration that specifies which type of authentication is allowed, but not the file system-based ACL check that verifies whether a file is accessible by a given user. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability would restrict the attacker to the permissions granted to the anonymous user account on file system ACL level. This could allow an attacker to anonymously access information that should only be accessible to an authenticated user, or write files to locations where the anonymous user account is granted write permission.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted HTTP request to a Web site that requires authentication, and thereby gain unauthorized access to protected resources.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Windows 2000 systems on which IIS version 5.0 is used and where WebDAV is enabled are primarily at risk. Typically these are Web servers or application servers, but they may also be developer or Web designer or other workstation systems on which IIS is used with WebDAV. Systems that deviate from the default configuration in that the anonymous user account has been granted write permission are at increased risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the WebDAV extension for IIS handles HTTP requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## IIS 5.1 and 6.0 WebDAV Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1535

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the WebDAV extension for IIS handles HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted anonymous HTTP request to gain access to a location that typically requires authentication.

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 5.0 and 7.0 are not affected by this vulnerability.
* **WebDAV is not enabled by default on IIS 6.0**. On IIS 6.0 running on Windows Server 2003 systems, WebDAV is not enabled in the default configuration. Unless WebDAV has been enabled by an administrator on these systems, the vulnerability is not exposed.
* **The anonymous user account is denied write access by default**. In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability with write access, the anonymous user account would need to have write access ACLs set within the IIS folder structure. However, by default, the anonymous user account only has read access ACLs set. On IIS 6.0, there is an explicit deny ACE for the default anonymous user account.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.
     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.
