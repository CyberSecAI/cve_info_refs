Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2009-1122:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the WebDAV extension for IIS handles specially crafted HTTP requests, specifically URLs. The WebDAV extension fails to properly decode certain URLs, which causes it to apply an incorrect configuration when handling the request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The core weakness is that the improperly handled URL can bypass the intended authentication requirements configured in IIS. This allows an attacker to potentially access resources that should require authentication.
- **Incorrect Configuration Application:** Due to improper decoding, WebDAV may not apply the correct configurations, such as IP address restrictions, that are configured for specific paths.
- **WebDAV vulnerability**: The vulnerability specifically lies within the WebDAV extension, and not within IIS itself.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker could elevate their privileges by bypassing authentication and gaining access to protected resources or write files to locations where the anonymous user account has write permissions.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to information that should only be accessible to authenticated users.
- **Potential for File Manipulation:** If the anonymous user account has write permissions in the targeted location, attackers could write files to the system.
- The attacker is limited to the permissions granted to the anonymous user account by file system ACLs.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP request directed towards a web site using the WebDAV extension that requires authentication.
- The vulnerability is triggered through manipulating URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable IIS server.
- The attacker does not need any specific authentication credentials for the targeted system.
- The attacker must craft a specific URL in the HTTP request.

**Additional Details:**
- CVE-2009-1122 affects IIS 5.0, while CVE-2009-1535 affects IIS 5.1 and 6.0
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way that the WebDAV extension for IIS handles HTTP requests.
- The vulnerability is rated as Important.
- Microsoft received the information through responsible disclosure.
- The default anonymous user account (IUSR_<computername>) usually has read access. If write access has been explicitly granted to this account, the risk is increased.
- File system ACLs are still enforced meaning that any access granted through this exploit will be limited to the anonymous user account permissions on the file system.
- Disabling WebDAV functionality is a potential workaround.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed prior to the security bulletin, though CVE-2009-1535 (which also addresses a WebDAV vulnerability) was.
