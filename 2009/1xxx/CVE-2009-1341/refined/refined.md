{
  "cveId": "CVE-2009-1341",
  "description": "Memory leak in the dequote_bytea function in quote.c in the DBD::Pg (aka DBD-Pg or libdbd-pg-perl) module before 2.0.0 for Perl allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by fetching data with BYTEA columns.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies within the `dequote_bytea` function in `quote.c` of the DBD::Pg module, specifically when handling BYTEA data types.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A context-dependent attacker can cause a denial of service due to excessive memory consumption when fetching data with BYTEA columns. This is due to the memory leak in dequoting bytea values.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Exploiting the memory leak vulnerability by repeatedly fetching data with BYTEA columns"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code that uses the vulnerable DBD::Pg module and can fetch BYTEA data from a database. The attacker's position is context-dependent."
  },
  "affectedProducts": [
      "libdbd-pg-perl versions before 2.0.0",
      "openSUSE 10.3, SLE10"
   ],
  "patchInformation": [
    "The issue is fixed in libdbd-pg-perl version 2.1.3-1 and later",
