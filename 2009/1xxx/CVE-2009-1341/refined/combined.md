3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

    they are automatically returned as arrays when fetching. [GSM]
  - Add support for asynchronous queries. [GSM]
  - Allow raw transaction statements through - in other words,
    do not croak if $dbh->prepare("COMMIT") is attempted. Not

    passed to the function if you expect this might happen.
    (CPAN bug #30924) [GSM]

    strings from ruining the prepare. UTF-16 may still cause problems.

    [Dominic Mitchell <dom@semantico.com>]
  - $dbh->prepare() rewrites the SQL statement into an internal form,
    striping out comments and whitespace, and if PostgreSQL > 7.3 takes the
    stripped statement and passes that to Postgres' PREPARE statement,
    then rewrites the statement as 'EXECUTE "DBD::PG::cached_query n"
    ($1, $2, ... $n, $n+1)' for DBD::Pg's execute.
    -- Currently disabled until PREPARE works a little better
  - Allows the use of :n and :foo bind params. So:
    (SELECT * FROM foo WHERE 1 = :this and 2 = :that) will now work.
  - Complains on execute when unbound bind params are submitted
    (instead of defaulting to NULL)
  - Switched over to use driver.xst.
  - pg_error() removes \n's rather than truncating the message on the first \n.
  - Fixed statement scan problem where the preparse of
    "SELECT foo[3:33] from bar" was scanning :33 as a placeholder
  - Moved the quoting of bind values out of execute() and into
    bind -- as there is no need to requote the value every time execute
    is called.
  - :veryverylongplaceholdername == Long walk, short pier -- fixed.
  - quote() is now in C and uses same code as bind_param.
  - Quoting and dequoting now use libpq quoting functions where available
    (I still need to take the libpq functions swiped out of quote.c and move
    it into libpqswip.c with license info &c., and switch ifndefs to ifdefs)
  - bind_param() will convert from 1,0 to TRUE/FALSE when pg_type
    is PGBOOLOID.
  - Fixed many heap buffer overruns.
  - Added support for the get_info() method [GSM]
  - Added tests for POD validation [Mark Stosberg]
  - Several improvements to column_info, including:
    - Fixed column_info so NULLABLE field shows correctly. [kevin@sysexperts.com]
    - REMARKS field works now [Mark Stosberbg]
    - COLUMN_DEF fixed
    - COLUMN_SIZE fixed
    - pg_constraint column added to display column constraints

# CVE 2009-1341

Memory leak in the dequote\_bytea function in quote.c in the DBD::Pg (aka DBD-Pg or libdbd-pg-perl) module before 2.0.0 for Perl allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by fetching data with BYTEA columns.

See the ![](/@@/link)
[CVE page on Mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2009-1341)

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1780-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                           Florian Weimer
April 28, 2009                        <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : libdbd-pg-perl
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-0663 CVE-2009-134

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in libdbd-pg-perl, the DBI
driver module for PostgreSQL database access (DBD::Pg).

CVE-2009-0663

  A heap-based buffer overflow may allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code through applications which read rows from the database using the
  pg_getline and getline functions.  (More common retrieval methods,
  such as selectall_arrayref and fetchrow_array, are not affected.)

CVE-2009-1341

  A memory leak in the routine which unquotes BYTEA values returned from
  the database allows attackers to cause a denial of service.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.49-2+etch1.

For the stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 2.1.3-1 before the release of
lenny.

We recommend that you upgrade your libdbd-pg-perl package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
