It states that the vulnerability is an elevation of privilege in Microsoft ISA Server 2006 when configured with Radius OTP and Kerberos Constrained Delegation. An unauthenticated user could gain access to Web published resources, potentially leading to complete control of systems behind the ISA Server. The bulletin includes mitigating factors (if the ISA server is not setup with Radius OTP, it's not vulnerable), workarounds (disabling fallback to Basic authentication), and an FAQ section describing the vulnerability, its cause, impact, and how an attacker could exploit it.  It confirms that at the time of bulletin release, the vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or actively exploited.",
