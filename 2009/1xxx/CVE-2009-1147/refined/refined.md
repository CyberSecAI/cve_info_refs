```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: A vulnerability exists in the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) driver (vmci.sys).
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Privilege escalation.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can gain elevated privileges on a Windows-based host or within a Windows-based guest operating system.
  - Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited locally on Windows-based machines, either on the host or within guest operating systems by leveraging the VMCI.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to have access to a Windows-based system where a vulnerable version of the VMCI driver is installed, either on the host or within the guest OS.
