Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1346:

**Verification:**

*   The exploit-db.com content explicitly mentions "CVE: [2009-1346](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2009-1346)" and describes a SQL injection vulnerability in "NetHoteles v3.0" which matches the CVE description.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ficha.php` script of the NetHoteles v3.0 application. Specifically, the `id_establecimiento` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including the database version, username, database name, and potentially other sensitive data from database tables including admin credentials.
*   **Data Manipulation/Modification:** The attacker can potentially modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can gain administrative access to the application by compromising admin credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to `ficha.php` with a crafted `id_establecimiento` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft the injection payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the web application.

**Technical Details from Exploit:**
The exploit-db content provides the following exploit URL as an example:

```
http://www.sierracazorla.com/nethoteles/publico/ficha.php?id_establecimiento=-13%27+UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,5,6,concat(@@version,0x3a,user(),0x3a,database()),8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27+from+admin/*
```
This payload demonstrates:
*   The injection starts with `-13'` to cause a syntax error if no injection is present
*   The `UNION SELECT` clause is used to inject a query and retrieve data.
*   The `concat` function concatenates the database version, user, and database name.
*   The `from admin` clause is likely intended to read credentials, although it's more likely to reveal data from an admin table than credentials directly.
*   The `/*` is an SQL comment to comment out any subsequent code to not break the query structure.

**Summary:**
This SQL injection vulnerability allows remote attackers to extract information from the database, potentially gain administrative access and perform other data manipulation actions by crafting a malicious URL. The vulnerability exists due to the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input when building SQL queries.
