Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1536:

**Vulnerability:** Remote Unauthenticated Denial of Service in ASP.NET

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how ASP.NET manages request scheduling. Specifically, it appears that ASP.NET, when running on IIS 7.0 in integrated mode, uses the Common Language Runtime (CLR) thread pool to manage requests. This mechanism is flawed, allowing specially crafted HTTP requests to disrupt the server's responsiveness.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper management of request scheduling in ASP.NET when hosted on IIS 7.0 in integrated mode, using the CLR thread pool
- Susceptibility to specially crafted anonymous HTTP requests

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can send specially crafted anonymous HTTP requests that cause the affected web server to become unresponsive.
- The server remains non-responsive until the associated application pool is restarted.
- Web pages relying on ASP.NET within the same application pool become unavailable, returning HTTP errors.
- The vulnerability causes an application-level denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: Attacker does not need local access
- Unauthenticated: Attacker does not need any credentials
- Network-based: Attacker sends specially crafted anonymous HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server running a vulnerable version of ASP.NET on IIS 7.0.
- No special privileges or authentication is required.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

-   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability impacts specific versions of the .NET Framework (2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 3.5, 3.5 SP1) on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 when IIS 7.0 is installed and ASP.NET is configured to use integrated mode.
-   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is not exploitable if IIS 7.0 is not in use, or if ASP.NET is not configured to use integrated mode.
-   **Workaround:** The provided workaround involves configuring IIS 7.0 to use the native thread pool instead of the CLR thread pool. This can be done by modifying the registry or through the ASP.NET config file.
-   **Microsoft Exploitability Index:** The vulnerability has a rating of "Exploitation more likely," indicating that exploit code could be created consistently and that Microsoft is aware of similar vulnerabilities being exploited in the past.
-   **Patch:** Microsoft has released updates to fix the vulnerability.
-  **Detection:** The Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) can be used to scan systems for the missing update.
- **Known Exploitation:** Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability.
