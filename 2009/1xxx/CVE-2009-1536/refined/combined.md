# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

Alert
# Microsoft Updates for Multiple Vulnerabilities

Last RevisedJanuary 24, 2013
Alert CodeTA09-223A

### Systems Affected

* Microsoft Windows and Windows Server
* Microsoft Office
* Remote Desktop Connection Client for Mac 2.0

### Overview

Microsoft has released updates to address vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, Windows Server, Office Web Components and Remote Desktop Connection for Mac.

Microsoft has released multiple security bulletins for critical vulnerabilities in Windows, Windows Server, Office Web Components, and Remote Desktop Connection for Mac. These bulletins are described in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for August 2009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-aug.mspx).

Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS09-037.mspx) includes updates for Microsoft components to address vulnerabilities in the Active Template Library ([ATL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3ax346b7%28VS.71%29.aspx)). Vulnerabilities present in the ATL can cause vulnerabilities in the resulting ActiveX controls and COM components. Any ActiveX control or COM component that was created with a vulnerable version of the ATL may be vulnerable, including ones distributed by third-party developers.

Developers should update the ATL as described in the previously released Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-035](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-035.mspx) in order to stop creating vulnerable controls. To address vulnerabilities in existing controls, recompile the controls using the updated ATL. Further discussion about the ATL vulnerabilities can be found in the [Microsoft Security Advisory 973882](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/973882.mspx).

### Impact

An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code, in some cases without user interaction.

### Solution

**Apply updates from Microsoft**

Microsoft has provided updates for these vulnerabilities in the [Microsoft Security Bulletin Summary for August 2009](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-aug.mspx). The security bulletin describes any known issues related to the updates. Administrators are encouraged to note these issues and test for any potentially adverse effects. Administrators should consider using an automated update distribution system such as [Windows Server Update Services](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/updateservices/default.mspx) (WSUS).

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-036 - Important

## Vulnerability in ASP.NET in Microsoft Windows Could Allow Denial of Service (970957)

Published: August 11, 2009 | Updated: August 13, 2009

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update addresses a privately reported Denial of Service vulnerability in the Microsoft .NET Framework component of Microsoft Windows. This vulnerability can be exploited only when Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0 is installed and ASP.NET is configured to use integrated mode on affected versions of Microsoft Windows. An attacker could create specially crafted anonymous HTTP requests that could cause the affected Web server to become non-responsive until the associated application pool is restarted. Customers who are running IIS 7.0 application pools in classic mode are not affected by this vulnerability.

This security update is rated Important for all affected versions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by changing the way ASP.NET manages request scheduling. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.**  The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Remote Unauthenticated Denial of Service in ASP.NET Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1536

A Denial of Service vulnerability exists in the way ASP.NET manages request scheduling. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating specially crafted anonymous HTTP requests that would cause the affected Web server to become non-responsive until the associated application pool is restarted.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-1536](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-1536).

#### Mitigating Factors for Remote Unauthenticated Denial of Service in ASP.NET Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1536

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerable code in Microsoft .NET Framework is exposed only through IIS 7.0. For systems not running IIS 7.0, there are no known attack vectors for this vulnerability.
* Systems running ASP.NET on IIS 7.0 in classic mode are not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Remote Unauthenticated Denial of Service in ASP.NET Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1536

Workarounds refer to settings or configuration changes that do not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Switch to the IIS native thread pool**

  When ASP.NET 2.0 is hosted on IIS 7.0 in integrated mode, ASP.NET manages requests using the common language runtime (CLR) thread pool. Systems on which the requests are managed by the IIS 7.0 native thread pool instead of by the CLR thread pool are not affected by this issue. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET: The CLR's Thread Pool](https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/cc164139.aspx).

  Use one of the following two methods to configure IIS 7.0 to use the native thread pool for process handling.

  **Method 1: Specify the value for maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU in the registry**

  This setting is global and affects all application pools. In order to configure this setting for individual application pools, refer to Method 2 in this section.

  **Warning** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ASP.NET\2.0.50727.0
  3. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Key**.
  4. Type **maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU**, and then press **Enter**.
  5. Click the **maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU** key.
  6. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then click **DWORD**.
  7. Type **maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU**, and then press **Enter**.
  8. On the **Edit** menu, click **Modify** to modify the **maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU** registry entry.
  9. In the **Value** data box, type **0**, and then click **OK**.
  10. Exit Registry Editor.
  11. Use iisreset.exe to restart Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) on the Web server that is hosting the application by running the following command at a command line:

      iisreset /restart

  **Specify the value for maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPUvia .REG file**

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ASP.NET\2.0.50727.0]

  "MaxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU"=dword:00000000

  You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

  [Group Policy collection](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd)

  **Impact of workaround.** Depending on the nature of applications running in this application pool, application performance may be affected.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Undoing the workaround manually

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**. Locate and then click the following registry subkey:

     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ASP.NET\2.0.50727.0\maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU
  2. Right-click the **maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU** subkey, click **Delete**, and then click **Yes**.
  3. Exit the Registry Editor. Use Iisreset.exe to restart Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) on the Web server that is hosting the application by running the following command from a command line:

     iisreset /restart

  Undoing the workaround via a .REG file

  Version 5.00

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ASP.NET\2.0.50727.0]

  "MaxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU"=dword:00000000

  You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

  [Group Policy collection](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd)

  [What is Group Policy Object Editor?](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a3)

  [Core Group Policy tools and settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc9491)

  **Method 2: Specify the value for maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPUfor an application pool in the ASP.NET config section of an ASPNET.Config file**

  **Note** This workaround only applies to systems on which the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SP2 or Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 is running. Earlier versions of the Microsoft .NET Framework do not read aspnet.config for this information. This value overrides the value that is specified for maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU in the registry.

  **Note** In order to undo this workaround, you need to restore the original version of the aspnet.config file. Before editing this file, create a backup.

  Open the aspnet.config file for the application pool and then enter new values for the maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU parameter as follows:

  <system.web>

  <applicationPool maxConcurrentRequestsPerCPU="0"/>

  </system.web>

  **Impact of workaround.** Depending on the nature of applications running in this application pool, application performance may be affected.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Restore the original version of the aspnet.config file.

#### FAQ for Remote Unauthenticated Denial of Service in ASP.NET Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1536

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a Denial of Service vulnerability that could allow an attacker to cause a Web server to become non-responsive.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused by ASP.NET incorrectly managing request scheduling.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the application pool on the affected Web server to become non-responsive until the application pool is restarted. As a result, Web pages that use ASP.NET in the same application pool would no longer be reachable and would return an HTTP error.

All non-ASP.NET features of the server are unaffected when a server is vulnerable to this issue and is attacked. For example, HTML pages will continue to load normally.

This is an application-level denial of service vulnerability. In order to recover from a successful attack, either IIS must be reset or the affected application pool must be recycled, but the server operating system does not need to be restarted.

**What is ASP.NET?**

ASP.NET is a collection of technologies within the Microsoft .NET Framework that enable developers to build Web applications and XML Web Services.

Unlike traditional Web pages, which use a combination of static HTML and scripting, ASP.NET uses compiled, event-driven pages. Because ASP.NET is a Web-based application environment, requiring an underlying Web server to provide basic HTTP functionality, ASP.NET runs on top of Internet Information Services (IIS). For more information, see [The Official Microsoft ASP.NET Site](https://www.asp.net/).

**What is the difference between Integrated Mode and Classic Mode in IIS 7.0?**

In IIS 7.0, each Web site hosted on the server can run in either Integrated Mode or Classic Mode. Integrated Mode is the default mode in IIS 7.0 and provides more granular control over the request process. Classic Mode reverts back to IIS 6.0 behavior when Integrated Mode was not yet available. For more information, see [How to Take Advantage of the IIS 7.0 Integrated Pipeline](https://learn.iis.net/page.aspx/244/how-to-take-advantage-of-the-iis7-integrated-pipeline).

**What is an application pool?**

In IIS 7.0, an application pool is a group of one or more URLs that are served by a worker process or a set of worker processes. Application pools set boundaries for the applications they contain, which means that any applications that are running outside a given application pool cannot affect the applications that are running inside that application pool. For more information, see [IIS 7.0: Managing Application Pools in IIS 7.0](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc753449%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted series of anonymous HTTP requests to an affected system and thereby cause the Web server running on this system to become non-responsive.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Servers on which ASP 2.0 is hosted on IIS 7.0 in integrated mode are at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update modifies the way in which ASP.NET manages request scheduling.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit the reported vulnerability.

| Further information | See the subsection, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance** |
| **Restart Requirement** |  |
| Restart required? | This update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason, or if required files are being used, this update will require a restart. If this behavior occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart. |
| HotPatching | Not applicable. |
| **Removal Information** | WUSA.exe does not support uninstall of updates. To uninstall an update installed by WUSA, click **Control Panel**, and then click **Security**. Under Windows Update, click **View installed updates** and select from the list of updates. |
| **File Information** | See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 970957](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/970957) |
| **Registry Key Verification** | **Note** A registry key does not exist to validate the presence of this update. |

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with **/quiet**, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |

**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in **Start Search**.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click on the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. Under the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.
  4. You may also click on the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.
  5. Finally, you may also click on the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
