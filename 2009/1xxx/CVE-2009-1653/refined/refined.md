{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the `tbs_us_examples_0view.php` script directly including the value of the `script` parameter in a `show_source` function call, without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to specify a file path, which will be then displayed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary local files on the server, potentially revealing sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or user data.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a specific HTTP GET request to `tbs_us_examples_0view.php` with a manipulated `script` parameter containing the desired file path. E.g., `path/examples/tbs_us_examples_0view.php?script=../../../../boot.ini`",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."
