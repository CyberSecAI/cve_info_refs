  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Buffer overflow in the 32bit FTP client when processing a PASV command response.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient bounds checking when handling an excessively long PASV reply.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the client machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker controls a malicious FTP server that sends an overly long PASV command response.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to set up a malicious FTP server. The vulnerable client must connect to this server."
