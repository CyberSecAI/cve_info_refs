    "Source": "www.exploit-db.com_75255159_20250125_224242.html",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Mini-stream Ripper when handling .asx files, specifically in the 'HREF' attribute.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the 'href' attribute within an .asx file.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by opening a specially crafted .asx file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious .asx file and have the victim open it with the vulnerable application."
