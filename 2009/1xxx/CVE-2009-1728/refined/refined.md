Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   A stack buffer overflow exists in the handling of Canon RAW images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stack buffer overflow:** The vulnerability lies in the way the software processes Canon RAW images, specifically related to how it handles the data within the image file which leads to writing outside of the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unexpected application termination:**  A crash of the application handling the image can occur.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker could potentially execute malicious code on the victim's system by crafting a malicious image which overwrites parts of the stack.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Maliciously crafted Canon RAW image:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted Canon RAW image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to deliver or get the victim to open the malicious image file. This could be done through various means such as email, web pages, or file sharing.
*   No special capabilities are needed by the user other than opening the image with an affected application.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided Apple advisory notes that this issue was addressed with "improved bounds checking", which implies that the fix involves ensuring that image processing operations are checked to make sure they are not writing data outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.
* The issue is mentioned to be addressed in Mac OS X v10.4 by a separate update, which could mean that the vulnerability may exist in different code bases of the same component.
* The vulnerability is identified in the Image RAW component of Mac OS X.
* The vulnerability was reported by Chris Ries of Carnegie Mellon University Computing Services.
