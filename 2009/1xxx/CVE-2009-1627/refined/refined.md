{
  "CVE-2009-1627": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly handle long strings in .asx files when processing the 'REF HREF' attribute within the 'ENTRY' tag. Specifically, the application does not perform adequate bounds checking when copying the provided URL to a fixed-size buffer.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer Overflow, specifically a heap overflow and a SEH based buffer overflow.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by overwriting the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) or causing a heap corruption and subsequently control the program execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local, by opening a specially crafted .asx file with the vulnerable application.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious .asx file and get the victim to open it using the vulnerable SDP Downloader application. No special network position or attacker privileges are required, as the vulnerability is triggered locally"
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SDP Downloader application exhibits a heap buffer overflow vulnerability when parsing an .asx file, due to insufficient bounds checking on the URL provided in the REF HREF tag.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap buffer overflow. The lack of input sanitization and boundary checks on the 'REF HREF' URL, leading to a buffer overflow on the heap. ",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service due to the heap overflow which crashes the application. Although this exploit demonstrates a Proof of Concept for a Denial of Service, it could potentially be leveraged for code execution with further exploitation.",
        "Attack vectors": "Local, by convincing a user to open a malicious .asx file with the vulnerable application.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create a malicious .asx file with a long URL within the REF HREF tag. The attacker must then convince the target user to open this file using the vulnerable SDP Downloader application."
