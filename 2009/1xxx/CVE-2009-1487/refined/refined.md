  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2009-1487",
      "root_cause": "The application uses a cookie to track user login status. The value of this cookie is used directly without any checks or sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Authentication Bypass via Insecure Cookie Handling"

        "The attacker can set the cookie 'user' via browser or other HTTP client to gain access"

        "root_cause": "The application uses unsanitized input from the 'module' GET parameter in the admin/load.php script to include php files.",

           "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files by manipulating the 'module' parameter. This could lead to information disclosure by accessing sensitive system files, or potentially remote code execution if an attacker can upload a malicious PHP file to the server.",
