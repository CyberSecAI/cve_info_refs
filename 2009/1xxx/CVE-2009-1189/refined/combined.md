| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=17803#c0)  schelte    2008-09-27 03:13:20 UTC  ``` Function dbus_signature_validate() panics when asked to validate the type signature "a{(ii)i}".   According to the docs, dbus_signature_validate() can be used to check a type signature for validity. So, it should indicate the mentioned type signature is invalid. It should not abort the whole program.  This was tested on SuSE 11.0, with libdbus 1.2.1.  Code to reproduce the error:  #include <dbus/dbus.h>  int main () {    return !dbus_signature_validate("a{(ii)i}", NULL); }  Result:  process 7016: arguments to dbus_type_is_basic() were incorrect, assertion "_dbus_type_is_valid (typecode) || typecode == DBUS_TYPE_INVALID" failed in file dbus-signature.c line 310. This is normally a bug in some application using the D-Bus library.   D-Bus not built with -rdynamic so unable to print a backtrace Aborted ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=17803#c1)  Havoc Pennington    2008-09-27 07:47:08 UTC  ``` Indeed, this is a bug. (Should add a unit test to avoid this happening again, along with the patch)  ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=17803#c2)  Havoc Pennington    2008-09-28 10:49:47 UTC  ``` The issue seems to be this code that "peeks ahead" at a type code that has not been validated yet:        if (last == DBUS_DICT_ENTRY_BEGIN_CHAR &&           !dbus_type_is_basic (*p))         {           result = DBUS_INVALID_DICT_KEY_MUST_BE_BASIC_TYPE;           goto out;         }  ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=17803#c3)  Colin Walters    2008-09-29 14:13:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 19288](attachment.cgi?id=19288 "validate type before we evaluate it") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=19288&action=edit "validate type before we evaluate it") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=17803&attachment=19288) validate type before we evaluate it  This looks like it should be sufficient.

# What is D-Bus?

D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a "single instance" application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed.

D-Bus supplies both a system daemon (for events such as "new hardware device added" or "printer queue changed") and a per-user-login-session daemon (for general IPC needs among user applications). Also, the message bus is built on top of a general one-to-one message passing framework, which can be used by any two apps to communicate directly (without going through the message bus daemon). Currently the communicating applications are on one computer, or through unencrypted TCP/IP suitable for use behind a firewall with shared NFS home directories. (Help wanted with [better remote transports](../DBusRemote/) - the transport mechanism is well-abstracted and extensible.)

The dbus [low-level API reference implementation](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/index.html) and the D-Bus [protocol](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html) have been heavily tested in the real world over several years, and are now "set in stone." Future changes will either be compatible or versioned appropriately.

The low-level libdbus reference library has no required dependencies; the reference bus daemon's only *required* dependency is an XML parser (expat). Higher-level bindings specific to particular frameworks (Qt, GLib, Java, C#, Python, etc.) add more dependencies, but can make more assumptions and are thus much simpler to use. The bindings evolve separately from the low-level libdbus, so some are more mature and ABI-stable than others; check the docs for the binding you plan to use.

There are also some reimplementations of the D-Bus protocol for languages such as C#, Java, and Ruby. These do not use the libdbus reference implementation.

It should be noted that the low-level implementation is not primarily designed for application authors to use. Rather, it is a basis for binding authors and a reference for reimplementations. If you are able to do so it is recommended that you use one of the higher level bindings or implementations. A list of these can be found on the [bindings page](../DBusBindings/).

The [list of projects using D-Bus](../DbusProjects/) is growing and they provide a wealth of examples of using the various APIs to learn from.

D-Bus is very portable to any Linux or UNIX flavor, and the port to Windows is mostly finished.

If you have any trouble with D-Bus or suggestions for improvement, bug reports and comments are very welcome.

Get on D-Bus today!

# Mailing List

All D-Bus discussion is currently on [dbus@lists.freedesktop.org](http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/dbus/).

# Reporting Bugs & Sending Patches

Please report bugs (and submit merge requests) for the D-Bus Specification and the reference implementation `dbus` through the [`dbus/dbus` project on the freedesktop.org Gitlab instance](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus).

For other implementations and bindings, please use the bug tracker for the appropriate implementation. For example, GDBus bugs are tracked in [the GLib project on GNOME's Gitlab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib), and sd-bus bugs are tracked in [the systemd project on Github](https://github.com/systemd/systemd).

Ideally, include test suite coverage with your patch; or if you report a bug, it's good to add a test that fails even if you don't have a patch otherwise.

Patches to improve test coverage are very welcome, though D-Bus is already among the best-covered codebases around.

# Documentation

Some stuff from the doc/ subdirectory is prebuilt and browsable here. If you're new to D-Bus, the tutorial is probably the best place to start (even though it is very incomplete, the basics are covered).

Generic D-Bus protocol information:

* [D-Bus specification](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html)
* [D-Bus Overview](http://packages.python.org/txdbus/dbus_overview.html) from the txdbus documentation
* [An introduction to the basics](../../IntroductionToDBus/) by Jeroen Vermeulen
* [Introduction to D-Bus](http://doc.trolltech.com/4.2/intro-to-dbus.html) from the Qt documentation
* [FAQ](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-faq.html)
* Overview picture [png](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/diagram.png) [svg](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/diagram.svg)
* [D-Bus tutorial (incomplete, has stuff on several bindings and reimplementations)](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-tutorial.html)
* [Config file DTD](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/busconfig.dtd)
* If you are confused about some of the concepts in DBus, look at [some analogies](../DBusAnalogy/)
* Some [tools](../DbusTools/) for working with D-Bus.
  Please note that the D-Bus spec is incomplete, especially in its description of the message bus daemon. The spec for the protocol itself is reasonably complete, though not always clear or precise. Your patches are welcome! In the meantime, you may need to supplement your reading of the spec with a reading of the reference implementation source code.

Docs specific to the reference implementation, dbus:

* [API reference manual for the reference implementation (libdbus)](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/index.html)
* [@todo items from reference implementation manual](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/todo.html) and high-level [TODO](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/TODO)
* [Browse reference implementation source](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/api/html/files.html)
* [dbus-daemon(1)](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-daemon.1.html) (includes configuration file docs)
* [dbus-send(1)](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-send.1.html) [dbus-monitor(1)](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-monitor.1.html) [dbus-launch(1)](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-launch.1.html) [dbus-uuidgen(1)](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-uuidgen.1.html)
* [HACKING](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/HACKING) [AUTHORS](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/AUTHORS)
* [NEWS](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/NEWS) [ChangeLog](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/ChangeLog) [README](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/README)
* [Test plan](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-test-plan.html)
* [Tarball](http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/dbus-docs.tar.gz) with most of the above docs.
  Keep in mind that libdbus is a low-level library, intended to be the backend for a language binding and with extra complexity needed to implement dbus-daemon. You will save yourself a lot of pain if you use a higher-level wrapper or a reimplementation. Documentation of these is usually linked from the [bindings page](../DBusBindings/).

# Download

## Reference Implementation (dbus, incorporating dbus-daemon and libdbus)

dbus is the reference implementation of D-Bus. Released versions can be downloaded from the [releases directory on dbus.freedesktop.org](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/) and are available in all major Linux distributions. If in doubt, use your distribution's packages.

The current **stable** branch is [dbus 1.14.x](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/blob/dbus-1.14/NEWS). This is the recommended version for most purposes.

The current **legacy** branch is [dbus 1.12.x](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/blob/dbus-1.12/NEWS). This is still supported, but only for security fixes: only use this version when upgrading from older stable releases, or preparing security updates for frozen/stable distributions.

Older branches such as 1.10.x have reached end-of-life and are unlikely to have any more releases, but distributors who still provide security support for an older version are invited to share backported patches via the older branches in the same git repository. Please contact the maintainers for more information.

The current **development** branch is [dbus 1.15.x](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/blob/HEAD/NEWS), which will lead to a 1.16.x stable branch in future. The development branch does not come with security support, and if it requires security fixes, they will often be released as part of an ordinary development release that also contains potentially destabilising changes. Please do not include a development branch of dbus in your OS distribution unless you can commit to tracking that branch and the stable branch that follows it, for example continuing to track dbus 1.15.x and then switching to 1.16.x when it becomes available.

Superseded development branches such as 1.13.x are entirely unsupported and do not receive any security fixes.

### Windows port

The Windows port from the windbus and dbus4win projects was merged into the freedesktop dbus development branch several years ago, and is released as part of dbus. Thanks to all the past and current contributors to that port.

It is known that the Windows port runs on Windows Vista, 8, 10 and server variants. Supported compilers/SDK are MSVC, mingw-w32/w64(gcc) and cygwin(gcc).

DBus on Windows is used by KDE, Gnome and commercial applications.

## Bindings and Independent Implementations

Bindings and independent implementations are linked to from the [Bindings Page](../DBusBindings/).

A binding wraps libdbus (and thus automatically gets e.g. new authentication mechanisms and other additions to libdbus), while a reimplementation codes the protocol from scratch (and thus avoids a dependency on the libdbus C library, but has to be kept in sync with new features).

# Source code

The latest versions of the D-Bus Specification and the reference implementation `dbus` are available in the [`dbus/dbus` project on the freedesktop.org Gitlab instance](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus).

For other implementations and bindings, please use the source code repository for the appropriate implementation. For example, GDBus is part of [the GLib project on GNOME's Gitlab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib), and sd-bus is part of [the systemd project on Github](https://github.com/systemd/systemd).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=17803#c0)  schelte    2008-09-27 03:13:20 UTC  ``` Function dbus_signature_validate() panics when asked to validate the type signature "a{(ii)i}".   According to the docs, dbus_signature_validate() can be used to check a type signature for validity. So, it should indicate the mentioned type signature is invalid. It should not abort the whole program.  This was tested on SuSE 11.0, with libdbus 1.2.1.  Code to reproduce the error:  #include <dbus/dbus.h>  int main () {    return !dbus_signature_validate("a{(ii)i}", NULL); }  Result:  process 7016: arguments to dbus_type_is_basic() were incorrect, assertion "_dbus_type_is_valid (typecode) || typecode == DBUS_TYPE_INVALID" failed in file dbus-signature.c line 310. This is normally a bug in some application using the D-Bus library.   D-Bus not built with -rdynamic so unable to print a backtrace Aborted ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=17803#c1)  Havoc Pennington    2008-09-27 07:47:08 UTC  ``` Indeed, this is a bug.

RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

# RHSA-2010:0095 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: rhev-hypervisor security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor package that fixes security issues and several
bugs is now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
(RHEV) Hypervisor ISO disk image. The RHEV Hypervisor is a dedicated
Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything
necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: RHEV Hypervisor is only available for the Intel 64 and AMD64
architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the IPv6 Extension Header (EH) handling
implementation in the Linux kernel. The skb->dst data structure was not
properly validated in the ipv6\_hop\_jumbo() function. This could possibly
lead to a remote denial of service. (CVE-2007-4567)

The Parallels Virtuozzo Containers team reported two flaws in the routing
implementation. If an attacker was able to cause a large enough number of
collisions in the routing hash table (via specially-crafted packets) for
the emergency route flush to trigger, a deadlock could occur. Secondly, if
the kernel routing cache was disabled, an uninitialized pointer would be
left behind after a route lookup, leading to a kernel panic.
(CVE-2009-4272)

A flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in
the Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using packets larger
than the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in
partial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws
could also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.
(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538)

A flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel.
Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network cards
supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of
service. (CVE-2009-4537)

The x86 emulator implementation was missing a check for the Current
Privilege Level (CPL) and I/O Privilege Level (IOPL). A user in a guest
could leverage these flaws to cause a denial of service (guest crash) or
possibly escalate their privileges within that guest. (CVE-2010-0298,
CVE-2010-0306)

A flaw was found in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation. Access
to the internal data structure pit\_state, which represents the data state
of the emulated PIT, was not properly validated in the pit\_ioport\_read()
function. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2010-0309)

This updated package provides updated components that include fixes for
security issues; however, these issues have no security impact for RHEV
Hypervisor. These fixes are for kernel issues CVE-2006-6304, CVE-2009-2910,
CVE-2009-3080, CVE-2009-3556, CVE-2009-3889, CVE-2009-3939, CVE-2009-4020,
CVE-2009-4021, CVE-2009-4138, and CVE-2009-4141; ntp issue CVE-2009-3563;
dbus issue CVE-2009-1189; dnsmasq issues CVE-2009-2957 and CVE-2009-2958;
gnutls issue CVE-2009-2730; krb5 issue CVE-2009-4212; bind issue
CVE-2010-0097; gzip issue CVE-2010-0001; openssl issues CVE-2009-2409 and
CVE-2009-4355; and gcc issue CVE-2009-3736.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* on systems with a large number of disk devices, USB storage devices may

get enumerated after "/dev/sdz", for example, "/dev/sdcd". This was not
handled by the udev rules, resulting in a missing "/dev/live" symbolic
link, causing installations from USB media to fail. With this update, udev
rules correctly handle USB storage devices on systems with a large number
of disk devices, which resolves this issue. (BZ#555083)

As RHEV Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug fixes from the KVM update
RHSA-2010:0088 have been included in this update:

<https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2010-0088.html>

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Subject: CVE-2009-1189: invalid fix for CVE-2008-3834 (dbus)

It came to our attention that a previous security fix for dbus
(CVE-2008-3834) didn't actually fix the security issue in question.

<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17803>

As a result, we've assigned CVE-2009-1189 to the issue.
