Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the `dbus_signature_validate()` function within the D-Bus library. Specifically, the function incorrectly "peeked ahead" at a type code in a D-Bus signature string before validating it, resulting in a crash when encountering an invalid signature. The initial fix for CVE-2008-3834 was insufficient to address the root issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `dbus_signature_validate()` function did not properly validate the type code in a D-Bus signature before using it, specifically when handling dictionary entries.
*   **Assertion Failure:** The incorrect type code processing triggered an assertion failure within the library, leading to program termination, indicating a denial-of-service vulnerability.
*   **Incomplete Fix:** The initial patch intended to fix CVE-2008-3834 was incorrect and did not fully resolve the underlying issue which lead to this new CVE being assigned.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could provide a specially crafted, invalid D-Bus signature string to an application that uses the vulnerable `dbus_signature_validate()` function, causing the application to crash (abort).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **D-Bus Message Passing:** An attacker would need to send a D-Bus message that includes a crafted invalid signature string to a vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send D-Bus Messages:** An attacker needs to be able to communicate with a vulnerable application via D-Bus, meaning they need to have access to the D-Bus system.
*   **Knowledge of D-Bus Protocol:** The attacker must understand the D-Bus protocol sufficiently to construct a message with the vulnerable signature string.

**Technical Details:**

The issue arose due to the following code logic within dbus-marshal-validate.c:

```c
if (last == DBUS_DICT_ENTRY_BEGIN_CHAR &&           !dbus_type_is_basic (*p))
{
    result = DBUS_INVALID_DICT_KEY_MUST_BE_BASIC_TYPE;
    goto out;
}
```

This code was checking for dictionary entry starts (`DBUS_DICT_ENTRY_BEGIN_CHAR`) and attempting to validate the subsequent character as a basic type, however, it was doing so before it was confirmed that `*p` was even a valid type. An invalid type character could lead to a crash in the `dbus_type_is_basic()` function.

The vulnerability was triggered by the invalid signature "a{(ii)i}".  The patch ensured that the type is validated before calling `dbus_type_is_basic()` on it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was initially identified with the signature string `a{(ii)i}`
*   The vulnerability was present in libdbus version 1.2.1
*   The fix involved changes to `dbus/dbus-marshal-validate.c` and a new test case in `dbus-marshal-validate-util.c`
