Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1337:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `exit_notify` function in the Linux kernel's `kernel/exit.c` file. The function didn't properly restrict exit signals when the `CAP_KILL` capability was held.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect capability check:** The `exit_notify` function fails to properly check for the `CAP_KILL` capability.
- **Unrestricted signal sending:**  This oversight allows a local user to send arbitrary signals to processes. Specifically, this occurs when an application modifies the `exit_signal` field, and then uses an `exec` system call to launch a setuid application before the signal is reset to SIGCHLD

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged user could exploit the vulnerability to send signals to arbitrary processes, which, in conjunction with setuid applications, enables privilege escalation by exploiting a race condition that occurs before the signal is reset to SIGCHLD.
- **Denial of Service:** Sending arbitrary signals can cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing target processes, and disrupting operations by preventing them from exiting gracefully.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local user on a system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local user access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system.
- **Ability to modify `exit_signal`:** The attacker needs to execute code that can modify the `exit_signal` field of the current process.
- **Exec a setuid application**: The attacker needs the ability to make an exec syscall to a setuid application.
- **CAP_KILL capability:** The attacker needs to execute code that either has the CAP_KILL capability or uses a setuid binary that possesses this capability

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the `exit_notify` function to enforce proper checks for the `CAP_KILL` capability.
- The vulnerability was present in Linux kernels before version 2.6.27.22, 2.6.28.10 and 2.6.29.3.
- The fix was implemented by the upstream kernel developers and backported to several Linux distributions, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, openSUSE and Debian.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2009-1337.
