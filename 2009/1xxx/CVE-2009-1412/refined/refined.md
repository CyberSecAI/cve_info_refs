{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "An error in handling URLs with a chromehtml: protocol.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a same-origin bypass that allows an attacker to run arbitrary scripts or enumerate files on the local disk.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could achieve universal cross-site scripting (UXSS) without user interaction, potentially leading to complete compromise of the user's browser session. They could also potentially access local files.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting a malicious webpage that, when viewed in Internet Explorer, causes Chrome to launch and execute attacker-controlled scripts.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a web page, and the victim needs to have Google Chrome installed and visit the attacker's webpage using Internet Explorer. The attacker can cause Chrome to open multiple tabs and load scripts after navigating to the attacker's URL."
