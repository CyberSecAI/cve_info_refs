{
  "CVE-2009-1104": {
    "Description": "The Java Plug-in in Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 Update 17 and earlier; 6 Update 12 and earlier; and 1.4.2_19 and earlier does not prevent Javascript that is loaded from the localhost from connecting to other ports on the system, which allows user-assisted attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via LiveConnect, aka CR 6724331. NOTE: this vulnerability can be leveraged with separate cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities for remote attack vectors.",
    "Root cause": "The Java Plug-in does not properly restrict Javascript code loaded from localhost from connecting to arbitrary ports on the system.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control",
        "Bypassing intended access restrictions"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can bypass intended access restrictions and potentially access other applications listening on different ports if the vulnerable system is also susceptible to XSS.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network",
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the user into loading malicious Javascript code from localhost and have the ability to exploit XSS vulnerabilities for a remote attack."
