Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-1918:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer handles table operations, specifically when appending elements to an invalid object. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability triggered during table operations. Specifically, appending malformed elements to an empty DIV element can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Privilege Escalation:**  The attacker gains the same privileges as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take full control of the system.
- **System Compromise:** A successful attack can lead to the installation of programs, modification or deletion of data, and the creation of new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host malicious web pages designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Malicious content can be injected into compromised websites, or websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers rely on users visiting the malicious web pages, typically through links in emails or instant messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely without requiring prior authentication.
- **Web Hosting:** Attackers need the ability to host or inject malicious code onto web pages.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers must convince users to visit the malicious website.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is related to a broader issue with the Active Template Library (ATL) as detailed in Microsoft Security Advisory (973882).
- The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-034.
- A defense-in-depth mitigation was introduced in MS09-034 to help prevent exploitation of ATL vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. This mitigation includes monitoring how ATL-based ActiveX controls read persisted data.
- The issue was reported to Microsoft by  wushi&ling of team509, working with TippingPoint and the Zero Day Initiative.
