Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1930:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Microsoft Telnet service not correctly implementing NTLM credential-reflection protections. This means the Telnet service doesn't properly prevent a user's credentials from being sent back and reused against them when they connect to a malicious server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Credential Reflection:** The core weakness is the Telnet service's failure to properly handle NTLM authentication, allowing an attacker to capture and reuse user credentials.
*   **Lack of Proper NTLM Protection:**  The Telnet service does not opt-in to the necessary NTLM credential-reflection protections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Full System Control:** An attacker could gain full control over the system, including:
    *   Installing programs
    *   Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    *   Creating new accounts with full user rights
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the user who connected to the malicious Telnet server. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker will also gain those privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Telnet Server:** An attacker hosts a specially crafted Telnet server designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker must convince a user to connect to their malicious Telnet server. This can be achieved through:
    *   Links in emails or instant messages.
    *   Any other method of tricking the user into connecting to the attacker's server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs a way to host a Telnet server that the victim can connect to.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick a user into connecting to their malicious Telnet server.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker requires technical skills to craft a malicious Telnet server that can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003, and "Moderate" for Windows Vista and Server 2008. The difference in severity is due to the fact that Telnet is not installed by default on Vista and Server 2008.
*   **Public Disclosure:** The vulnerability was publicly disclosed prior to the release of the security update.
*   **No Reported Exploitation:**  At the time of the security bulletin's release, Microsoft had not received reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild.
*   **Mitigation:** Firewalls and principle of least privilege can help reduce the impact.
*   **Patch:** Microsoft released a security update to address the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Telnet service validates authentication replies.
*   **Extended Protection:** The update also enables Telnet servers and clients to opt in to Extended Protection for Authentication, providing an additional layer of security.

The provided documents also include information related to:
*   Microsoft Exploitability Index, which rates the likelihood of exploitation.
