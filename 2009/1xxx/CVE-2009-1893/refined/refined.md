Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-1893:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `dhcpd` init script (`/etc/init.d/dhcpd`) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 creates temporary files in an insecure manner within the `configtest()` function. The temporary file name is predictable as it uses the script's process ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The init script creates a temporary file with a predictable name based on the process ID.
*   **Symlink Attack:** A local attacker can exploit the predictable temporary file name by creating a symbolic link to an arbitrary file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** When the init script is executed with the `configtest`, `restart`, or `reload` options, it will write the output of `dhcpd -t` (DHCP configuration file syntax check) to the temporary file. If a symbolic link is in place, the output will overwrite the attacker's chosen arbitrary file.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation/System Compromise:** If the attacker overwrites critical system files, this could lead to privilege escalation or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the `dhcpd` init script runs.
*   **Symbolic Link Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a symbolic link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user with the ability to execute commands on the system.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker must have access to the filesystem and the ability to create a symbolic link to an arbitrary file.
*   **Trigger Script Execution:** The attacker needs to rely on a system administrator executing the DHCP init script with "configtest", "restart", or "reload" argument.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and current Fedora versions were not affected.
*   The provided content details a fix through RHSA-2009:1154 which backported patches to correct this issue.
