  "CVE-2009-1385": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the Intel PRO/1000 network driver in the Linux kernel. Frames with sizes near the MTU of an interface may be split across multiple hardware receive descriptors. Receipt of such a frame could leak through a validation check, leading to a corruption of the length check. A remote attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted packet that would cause a denial of service or code execution.",

         "root_cause":"E1000 by default does two things: 1) Spans rx descriptors for packets that don't fit into 1 skb on receive 2) Strips the crc from a frame by subtracting 4 bytes from the length prior to doing an skb_put Since the e1000 driver isn't written to support receiving packets that span multiple rx buffers, it checks the End of Packet bit of every frame, and discards it if its not set.  If the second part of the frame is small (4 bytes or less), we subtract 4 from it to remove its crc, underflow the length, and wind up in skb_over_panic, when we try to skb_put a huge number of bytes into the skb.",
