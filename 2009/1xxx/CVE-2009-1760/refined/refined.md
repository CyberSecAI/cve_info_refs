{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The libtorrent library does not properly sanitize file paths extracted from torrent files, particularly in multi-file mode. It only checks for '..' as a path component but does not account for other relative path traversal techniques, such as overloading directory components with partial paths.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23)",
      "Improper Handling of Syntactically Invalid Structure (CWE-228)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create and overwrite arbitrary files and directories on a remote system with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application. This could lead to a denial of service, data corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution if executable files are overwritten.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted .torrent file containing malicious relative paths in the file path elements, designed to exploit the insufficient sanitization within libtorrent when handling multi-file mode torrents.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious torrent file and entice a user to open it with a vulnerable libtorrent-based application. No other specific capabilities are required beyond the ability to craft and share a torrent file."
