  "CVE-2009-1904": {
    "description": "The BigDecimal library in Ruby 1.8.6 before p369 and 1.8.7 before p173 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a string argument that represents a large number, as demonstrated by an attempted conversion to the Float data type.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A flaw in the BigDecimal standard library of Ruby causes a segmentation fault when converting BigDecimal objects with very large values to Float numbers due to improper handling of string arguments representing large numbers in `ext/bigdecimal/bigdecimal.c`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) resulting in application crash or segmentation fault.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted string argument representing a very large number to a Ruby application that utilizes the BigDecimal library.",
         "Conversion from BigDecimal objects into Float numbers."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to send/provide a string argument that represents a large number to a vulnerable Ruby application."
    },
    "affected_versions": [
      "Ruby 1.8.6 prior to p369",
      "Ruby 1.8.7 prior to p173"
    ],
    "unaffected_versions": [
      "Ruby 1.9.1 and later"
    ],
    "patch_details": [
     "The vulnerability is fixed in Ruby version 1.8.6-p369 and 1.8.7-p174.",
      "The fix involved proper handling of large numbers and avoiding ALLOCA_N() in ext/bigdecimal/bigdecimal.c",
      "A workaround has been created (bigdecimal-segfault-fix gem) which limits numbers to 255 digits and prevents scientific notation. However, this is not the recommended solution and users are advised to upgrade instead.",
