Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2009-1049:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability lies in the `editArticle` function within `articleCall.php`. The function directly incorporates the `id` GET parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the line `$query = "select * FROM articles WHERE id='$id'";` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization on the `id` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling (related, but not CVE-2009-1049 directly):** While not the core of CVE-2009-1049, the application uses a cookie ("identifyYourself") to determine user authentication. This cookie is set after a successful username/password check. However, the application trusts this cookie entirely. This allows an attacker to bypass the login process by simply setting the cookie, which is demonstrated in the exploit. This weakness is related to CVE-2009-1050.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious code into the `id` parameter. This can lead to a variety of impacts. The example shows using `load_file()` to read sensitive files from the server's filesystem
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By combining SQL injection with `outfile`, an attacker can write malicious php code to the webserver, and execute it remotely. This allows the attacker to achieve remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through manipulating the `id` parameter of a GET request to the `articleCall.php` file.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** Although not the core of this CVE, the attacker needs to set a valid cookie (`identifyYourself=you+are+identified`) to be able to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability in the vulnerable page (e.g. `articleCall.php`). This cookie can be set directly, or as shown in the other exploit report, through an insecure login mechanism (which is part of CVE-2009-1050)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to set the cookie in the browser. This could be done by modifying the cookie directly, or exploiting the related cookie bypass vulnerability described in the other exploit.
