How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

Igor Zhbanov discovered that NFS clients were able to create device nodes

even when root\_squash was enabled. An authenticated remote attacker

could create device nodes with open permissions, leading to a loss of

privacy or escalation of privileges. Only Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04 were

affected. ([CVE-2009-1072](/security/CVE-2009-1072))

Dan Carpenter discovered that SELinux did not correctly handle

certain network checks when running with compat\_net=1. A local

attacker could exploit this to bypass network checks. Default Ubuntu

installations do not enable SELinux, and only Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04 were

affected. ([CVE-2009-1184](/security/CVE-2009-1184))

Shaohua Li discovered that memory was not correctly initialized in the

AGP subsystem. A local attacker could potentially read kernel memory,

leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-1192](/security/CVE-2009-1192))

Benjamin Gilbert discovered that the VMX implementation of KVM did

not correctly handle certain registers. An attacker in a guest VM

could exploit this to cause a host system crash, leading to a denial

of service. This only affected 32bit hosts. Ubuntu 6.06 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-1242](/security/CVE-2009-1242))

Thomas Pollet discovered that the Amateur Radio X.25 Packet Layer Protocol

did not correctly validate certain fields. A remote attacker could exploit

this to read kernel memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-1265](/security/CVE-2009-1265))

Trond Myklebust discovered that NFS did not correctly handle certain

long filenames. An authenticated remote attacker could exploit this to

cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service. Only Ubuntu 6.06

was affected. ([CVE-2009-1336](/security/CVE-2009-1336))

Oleg Nesterov discovered that the kernel did not correctly handle

CAP\_KILL. A local user could exploit this to send signals to arbitrary

processes, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-1337](/security/CVE-2009-1337))

Daniel Hokka Zakrisson discovered that signal handling was not correctly

limited to process namespaces. A local user could bypass namespace

restrictions, possibly leading to a denial of service. Only Ubuntu 8.04

was affected. ([CVE-2009-1338](/security/CVE-2009-1338))

Pavel Emelyanov discovered that network namespace support for IPv6 was

not correctly handled. A remote attacker could send specially crafted

IPv6 traffic that would cause a system crash, leading to a denial of

service. Only Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04 were affected. ([CVE-2009-1360](/security/CVE-2009-1360))

Neil Horman discovered that the e1000 network driver did not correctly

validate certain fields. A remote attacker could send a specially

crafted packet that would cause a system crash, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2009-1385](/security/CVE-2009-1385))

Pavan Naregundi discovered that CIFS did not correctly check lengths

when handling certain mount requests. A remote attacker could send

specially crafted traffic to cause a system crash, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2009-1439](/security/CVE-2009-1439))

Simon Vallet and Frank Filz discovered that execute permissions were

not correctly handled by NFSv4. A local user could bypass permissions

and run restricted programs, possibly leading to an escalation of

privileges. ([CVE-2009-1630](/security/CVE-2009-1630))

Jeff Layton and Suresh Jayaraman discovered buffer overflows in the CIFS

client code. A malicious remote server could exploit this to cause a

system crash or execute arbitrary code as root. ([CVE-2009-1633](/security/CVE-2009-1633))

Mikulas Patocka discovered that /proc/iomem was not correctly

initialized on Sparc. A local attacker could use this file to crash

the system, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 6.06 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-1914](/security/CVE-2009-1914))

Miklos Szeredi discovered that OCFS2 did not correctly handle certain

splice operations. A local attacker could exploit this to cause

a system hang, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 6.06 was not

affected. ([CVE-2009-1961](/security/CVE-2009-1961))

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change for Ubuntu 8.04, 8.10 and 9.04

the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires

you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you

might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to

update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel

version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system

upgrade will automatically perform this as well.

                 CVE-2009-1895 CVE-2009-1914 CVE-2009-1961 CVE-2009-2406
                 CVE-2009-2407

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2009-1385

    Neil Horman discovered a missing fix from the e1000 network driver.
    A remote user may cause a denial of service by way of a kernel panic
    triggered by specially crafted frame sizes.

CVE-2009-1389

    Michael Tokarev discovered an issue in the r8169 network driver.
    Remote users on the same LAN may cause a denial of service by way
    of a kernel panic triggered by receiving a large size frame.

CVE-2009-1630

    Frank Filz discovered that local users may be able to execute
    files without execute permission when accessed via an nfs4 mount.

CVE-2009-1633

    Jeff Layton and Suresh Jayaraman fixed several buffer overflows in
    the CIFS filesystem which allow remote servers to cause memory
    corruption.

CVE-2009-1895

    Julien Tinnes and Tavis Ormandy reported and issue in the Linux
    vulnerability code. Local users can take advantage of a setuid
    binary that can either be made to dereference a NULL pointer or
    drop privileges and return control to the user. This allows a
    user to bypass mmap_min_addr restrictions which can be exploited
    to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2009-1914

    Mikulas Patocka discovered an issue in sparc64 kernels that allows
    local users to cause a denial of service (crash) by reading the
    /proc/iomem file.

CVE-2009-1961

    Miklos Szeredi reported an issue in the ocfs2 filesystem. Local
    users can create a denial of service (filesystem deadlock) using
    a particular sequence of splice system calls.

CVE-2009-2406
CVE-2009-2407

    Ramon de Carvalho Valle discovered two issues with the eCryptfs
    layered filesystem using the fsfuzzer utility. A local user with
    permissions to perform an eCryptfs mount may modify the contents
    of a eCryptfs file, overflowing the stack and potentially gaining
    elevated privileges.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.8etch2.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.

Note: Debian 'etch' includes linux kernel packages based upon both the
2.6.18 and 2.6.24 linux releases.  All known security issues are
carefully tracked against both packages and both packages will receive
security updates until security support for Debian 'etch'
concludes. However, given the high frequency at which low-severity
security issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource
requirements of doing an update, lower severity 2.6.18 and 2.6.24
updates will typically release in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request: kernel: sparc64: Fix crash with /proc/iomem

This was introduced in commit 9fd8b647 (v2.6.22-rc1), and fixed in
commit 192d7a46. The description is as follows:

From: Mikulas Patocka <mpatocka@...hat.com>

[ Upstream commit 67c6d11d1a174ec4cad9a3c5d5f9043c ]

When you compile kernel on Sparc64 with heap memory checking and type
"cat /proc/iomem", you get a crash, because pointers in struct
resource are uninitialized.

Most code fills struct resource with zeros, so I assume that it is
responsibility of the caller of request_resource to initialized it,
not the responsibility of request_resource functuion.

After 2.6.29 is out, there could be a check for uninitialized fields
added to request_resource to avoid crashes like this.

```
