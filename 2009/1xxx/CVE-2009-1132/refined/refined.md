Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of specific malformed wireless frames by the Wireless LAN AutoConfig Service (wlansvc). This lack of validation can lead to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap overflow in the Wireless LAN AutoConfig Service.
- Improper parsing of wireless frames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain complete control of the affected system.
- Ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could deploy a wireless transmitter that sends specially crafted malicious wireless frames to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within range of a wireless network interface of a vulnerable system.
- The attacker needs to be able to send malformed wireless frames.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**
- Systems without an enabled wireless card are not at risk.
- The vulnerability affects Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Windows Server 2008 Server Core installations are not affected.
- A workaround is provided which disables the Wlansvc, but also disables wireless networking.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by extending the Wireless LAN AutoConfig service to properly validate wireless frames prior to processing them.
- The exploit is triggered by a specific malformed frame.
