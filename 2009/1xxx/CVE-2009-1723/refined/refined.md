Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1723:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an issue in how CFNetwork handles 302 redirects when displaying certificate warnings in Safari. Specifically, when a website is reached via a 302 redirect, and a certificate warning is shown, the warning displays the original URL instead of the final, redirected URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect URL display in certificate warnings
- Lack of proper handling of redirects in CFNetwork
- Potential for user confusion due to misleading URL display

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious website, reached through a trusted website via an open redirector, could control the displayed URL in the certificate warning.
- This could mislead users into believing they are still on the trusted site, while actually interacting with a malicious site.
- The vulnerability may facilitate phishing attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack involves a website that redirects using a 302 response code.
- The redirection must go through an open redirector on a trusted website.
- The final destination website needs to have a certificate issue that would trigger a certificate warning.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control a malicious website.
- The attacker needs to have an open redirect on a website that users trust.
- The attacker needs to be able to set up the malicious website in a way that triggers a certificate warning.
- The attacker doesn't require any specific position in the network.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.7 and iOS 2.0 through 3.1.3 for iPhone 3G and later, iOS 2.1 through 3.1.3 for iPod touch (2nd generation) and later.
- The issue was addressed by correcting the URL handling in the CFNetwork layer.
