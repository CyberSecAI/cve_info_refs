Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `Refresh` header in web browsers. Specifically, when a server sends a `Refresh` header containing a `javascript:` URI, vulnerable browsers would redirect to and execute the JavaScript code embedded in that URI. This allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of the affected website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The browsers fail to properly sanitize or validate the URI provided in the `Refresh` header, allowing the execution of script from a header.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable website. This is classic XSS.
*   **Inconsistent Implementation:** Different browsers had different behaviors regarding the `Refresh` header, some were vulnerable, and some were not. Also, some browsers had different behaviors with different status codes.
*   **Lack of proper URI validation** Browsers failed to treat `javascript:` URIs in `Refresh` headers as a security risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, within the context of a vulnerable website.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks:** This allows attackers to perform various malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, hijacking user sessions, or redirecting users to phishing websites.
*   **Data Theft:** With the access to the site via the injected script, stealing sensitive user data and login credentials can be performed.
*   **Phishing attacks:** By redirecting to malicious data URLs the attacker can perform phishing attacks.
*   **DoS (Denial of Service):** Attackers can craft malicious redirect headers causing browsers to crash.
*   **Social Engineering Attacks:** By using a `javascript:` URI through a redirector with a `302 Object moved` response and tricking the user into clicking on the link, arbitrary code execution in context of the site could be accomplished.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated `Refresh` Headers:** An attacker could inject a `Refresh` header in a server response, or could control the value that a site places in the `Refresh` header.
*  **Abuse of Redirectors:** The attacker could use a vulnerable redirector to send the malicious `Refresh` header.
* **Malicious Links:** Malicious links could be sent in emails or other medium and users who click the link can be victim to the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control a server response:** The attacker needs to be able to control the HTTP response headers of the server to inject the malicious `Refresh` header. This could be through a vulnerability in the web application, or through a malicious redirector service.
*   **User interaction (Social engineering):** In one specific attack vector (attack #4 and #5), the attacker would need the victim to click a link in order to execute the javascript code.

**Additional details from the content (beyond the CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability was not limited to Firefox, but also affected other browsers such as Internet Explorer 6, Opera and Chrome (though not all versions), old Mozilla versions and others, until patched.
*  The vulnerability can be exploited via server-side location and refresh redirectors (headers).
* The vulnerability was also found in old versions of Firefox as well as in SeaMonkey.
* The attack can be conducted using `data:` URIs as well as javascript URIs.
*  The article from `websecurity.com.ua` goes into great detail on different exploitation methods, including social engineering attacks via `302 Object Moved` redirects.
*  The Red Hat Bugzilla entries provide evidence of the effort to patch this vulnerability across different Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions and related products.
*   The `bugzilla.mozilla.org` entry shows the various patches proposed and then the one which was actually implemented.

In summary, CVE-2009-1312 describes a vulnerability in several browsers where malicious javascript code could be executed via a crafted HTTP `Refresh` header.
