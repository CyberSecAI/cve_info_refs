{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not sanitize user-supplied input in the 'username' field during the registration process.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Static Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Every time the vulnerable user's username is displayed on the site (e.g., in comments or game scores), the attacker's injected XSS payload will execute.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects the XSS payload into the 'username' field during registration.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the registration page of the application, and create a user account using a malicious username."
