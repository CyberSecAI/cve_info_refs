  "CVE-2009-1125": {
    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists because the Windows kernel does not properly validate an argument passed to a Windows kernel system call. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The Windows kernel does not properly validate an argument passed to a system call.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper argument validation in a Windows kernel system call"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, leading to complete control over the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with valid logon credentials and local access to the system can exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs valid logon credentials and local access."
