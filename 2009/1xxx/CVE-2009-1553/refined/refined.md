Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2009-1553

**Vulnerability Description:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server and Sun Java System Application Server.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a flaw in how the application server handles user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application server does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of the user's web browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens
    - Defacing websites
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- An attacker would need to craft a malicious link or inject malicious script within a user-supplied input field and have the user interact with it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker requires no authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to interact with the malicious script (e.g., by clicking on a crafted link or accessing a compromised page).
- The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to construct and inject XSS payloads.
- The attacker can be located anywhere on the internet.

**Affected Products:**
- Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server v2.1 patch 1 and earlier
- Sun Java System Application Server 9.1U2 and earlier

**CVSS Severity:**
- The JVN iPedia lists the CVSS v2 base score as 2.6 (Low). However, the JVN analysis gives it a High severity because of the low complexity of the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**
- Sun Java System Application Server is now distributed as the open-sourced Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server.
- The vulnerability was reported by Project VEX of UBsecure, Inc.

**Mitigation:**
- Update the software to the latest versions as recommended by the vendor.
