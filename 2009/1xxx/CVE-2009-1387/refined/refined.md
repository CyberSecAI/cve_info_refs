Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-1387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference within the `dtls1_retrieve_buffered_fragment()` function in `src/d1_both.c`. This function is responsible for handling DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) fragments, and the issue arises during `memcpy` operation from `frag->fragment`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability occurs when the code attempts to access memory through a pointer that does not point to a valid memory address (points to NULL).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference leads to a crash of the DTLS server, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted DTLS packets:** A remote attacker can send specially crafted DTLS packets to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Out-of-sequence messages:** The vulnerability is triggered by out-of-sequence DTLS handshake messages, suggesting that the attacker can manipulate the order of messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely without authentication.
- **DTLS network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send DTLS packets to the target server.
- **Ability to manipulate DTLS message order:** The attacker needs the ability to send out-of-sequence DTLS handshake messages.
