Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass - Login Form)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `login.php` script directly incorporates user-supplied input (`$uname` and `$upass`) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses:**  SQL Injection vulnerability is present.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can bypass authentication by injecting malicious SQL code. In this specific exploit, using `' OR 1=1 /*` will make the condition always true, thus logging in without a valid password.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `username` field of the login form
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires the ability to submit HTTP requests with manipulated username field.

**2. Insecure Cookie Handling (Authentication Bypass)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `checklogin()` function in `user.php` prioritizes the `$_COOKIE['user']` over the `$_SESSION['user']` when a session is not set. This allows an attacker to set an arbitrary value to the cookie.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insecure handling of user authentication cookies.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access by setting a cookie named `user` with an arbitrary value (like `1`). This will bypass the authentication mechanism.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `user` cookie.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires the ability to set cookies in the browser.

**3. Local File Inclusion (LFI)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `load.php` script directly includes a file based on the `module` parameter provided in the URL, without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Local File Inclusion vulnerability is present.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can include arbitrary local files.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `module` parameter in the URL. The exploit uses path traversal (`../`) and a null byte injection (`%00`) to bypass any potential filename checks.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests with manipulated `module` parameter value. The attacker needs to be logged in as admin for the exploit to work.
