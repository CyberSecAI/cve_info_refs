Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1920:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the JScript scripting engine processes scripts within web pages. Specifically, a memory corruption issue occurs when the JScript engine attempts to load a malformed script into memory. This corruption can lead to either a denial-of-service condition (where Internet Explorer stops responding) or, more critically, to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability within the JScript engine during script processing.
*   **Lack of Proper Input Validation/Sanitization:** The JScript engine fails to properly handle malformed script inputs, leading to the memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Complete System Control:** If the user is logged in with administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control over the system. This includes the ability to:
    *   Install programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new user accounts with full privileges.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** In less severe cases, exploitation can cause Internet Explorer to crash or become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attacks:** An attacker could host a malicious website containing a specially crafted script designed to trigger the vulnerability when visited by a user.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into compromised websites or sites that accept user-provided content.
*   **Email/Instant Messaging:** Attackers can use phishing techniques to trick users into clicking a link that leads to a malicious website that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Advertisements:** Delivering malicious content through online banner advertisements or other methods of delivering web content can be used to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Web Content:** Attackers need the capability to host malicious web pages or inject malicious scripts into existing web pages.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers must convince users to visit the malicious website, often through trickery or deception.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** Attackers need knowledge of the vulnerability in the JScript engine to craft the malicious script correctly.
*   **No User Interaction (after initial visit/click):** After a user visits a malicious page, the vulnerability can be triggered automatically when the browser processes the script, without any further user interaction.
*   **User Privileges:** An attacker gains the privileges of the current user, so the higher the privilege the greater the impact.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects various versions of JScript (5.1, 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8) on different Windows versions including Windows 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, and Server 2008.
*   The vulnerability was privately reported.
*   Microsoft released security updates to address the vulnerability, which primarily modifies the way the JScript engine handles scripts.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" due to the potential for remote code execution and complete system compromise.

This information provides a thorough understanding of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and the ways in which it can be exploited.
