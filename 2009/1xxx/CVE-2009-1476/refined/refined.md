Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1476:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `load_http` function within the `lib/load_http.c` file of IPFilter (ippool) version 4.1.31.
- The `load_http` function constructs an HTTP GET request by concatenating strings into a fixed-size buffer (`buffer[1024]`).  Specifically, it uses `sprintf` which does not perform any length checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The code copies the provided URL and host into a 1024-byte buffer without proper bounds checking.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** Although there is a check for URL length (greater than 512), the combined length of the URL, "GET ... HTTP/1.0\r\n", and "Host: ...\r\n\r\n" can easily exceed the buffer size when a long URL is provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a long URL, leading to a buffer overflow. This could overwrite stack memory, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable program, which may have root privileges if installed as a system utility.
- **Denial of Service:** A successful exploit could also cause the program to crash, leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Complete Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** According to the provided information, the exploit has the potential to completely compromise confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the `ippool` command to load a malicious URL (from local storage).
- **Exploitation via ippool:** The `ippool` utility is mentioned as a program that could potentially be used to trigger the vulnerability through its usage of `load_http`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system to execute the `ippool` command.
- The attacker must be able to supply a specially crafted URL, exceeding the buffer size when combined with the other strings.
- The attacker needs to provide the crafted input string to `ippool`, which can be achieved by using the command from the command line, or by crafting a malicious configuration file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `lib/load_http.c` file.
- The `sprintf` function is used to format the HTTP request, which does not prevent buffer overflows by default.
- The provided NetBSD fix used `snprintf` instead of `sprintf` and increased the buffer size to 2048 bytes, preventing this type of overflow, and performing additional checks on the return value of the snprintf calls.
