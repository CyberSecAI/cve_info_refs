How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=500358#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-05-12 12:38:12 UTC  ``` From SquirrelMail vulnerability report:  An issue was fixed that allowed an attacker to possibly steal user data by hijacking the SquirrelMail login session.  Credits: Tomas Hoger  Patch:  <http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrelmail?view=rev&revision=13676>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=500358#c1)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-12 13:07:28 UTC  ``` squirrelmail-1.4.18-1.fc9 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 9. <http://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/squirrelmail-1.4.18-1.fc9>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=500358#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2009-05-12 13:23:46 UTC  ``` This issue does not affect current squirrelmail packages shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4 and 5.  Change similar to the upstream fix mentioned in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=500358#c0) (upstream SVN r13676) was introduced via RHSA-2009:0057 (<http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0057.html>) to mitigate the impact of the Red Hat-specific session management regression introduced in RHSA-2009:0010, [bug #480224](show_bug.cgi?id=480224 "CLOSED ERRATA - Squirrelmail session management broken by security backport").  The change ensured new session id was regenerated after each successful login, and also provides protection against session fixation class of attacks.  The change has now been included in upstream SquirrelMail too.  The impact of the flaw was limited, as it required an attacker to be able to set malicious cookie on the victim's system.  Successful exploitation did not allow an attacker to get full access to the victim's mail.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=500358#c3)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-13 00:20:54 UTC  ``` squirrelmail-1.4.18-1.fc9 has been pushed to the Fedora 9 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=500358#c4)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-13 00:22:30 UTC  ``` squirrelmail-1.4.18-1.fc11 has been pushed to the Fedora 11 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=500358#c5)  Fedora Update System    2009-05-13 00:23:46 UTC  ``` squirrelmail-1.4.18-1.fc10 has been pushed to the Fedora 10 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=500358#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2009-05-14 18:06:54 UTC  ``` CVE-2009-1580:  Session fixation vulnerability in SquirrelMail before 1.4.18 allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions via a crafted cookie.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=500358#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2009-05-15 14:37:16 UTC  ``` Fedora updated now to 1.4.18, no further action required for Red Hat Enterprise Linux packages (see [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=500358#c2)).  Closing.   ``` |  |

Debian Bug     : 528528

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in SquirrelMail,
a webmail application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-1578

    Cross site scripting was possible through a number of pages which
    allowed an attacker to steal sensitive session data.

CVE-2009-1579

    Code injection was possible when SquirrelMail was configured to
    use the map_yp_alias function to authenticate users. This is not
    the default.

CVE-2009-1580

    It was possible to hijack an active user session by planting a
    specially crafted cookie into the user's browser.

CVE-2009-1581

    Specially crafted HTML emails could use the CSS positioning feature
    to place email content over the SquirrelMail user interface, allowing
    for phishing.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.9a-4.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.15-4+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.18-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.
