Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-1957:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of malformed `IKE_SA_INIT` requests within the `charon` daemon of strongSwan. Specifically, when processing a malformed `IKE_SA_INIT` request, the daemon enters an incomplete state but does not properly clean up, leaving an orphaned data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper State Handling:** The `charon` daemon fails to properly delete the IKE_SA when `IKE_SA_INIT` processing fails, leading to an incomplete state.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** Subsequent `CREATE_CHILD_SA` requests would then attempt to dereference a NULL pointer, triggering a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can send malformed `IKE_SA_INIT` packets to crash the `charon` daemon, causing a denial of service. The service becomes unavailable until restarted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending specially crafted `IKE_SA_INIT` packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send IPsec IKEv2 packets to the target system.
*   **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs to craft a malformed `IKE_SA_INIT` packet, exploiting specific parsing/processing weaknesses in the strongSwan code.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix involves deleting the `IKE_SA` when `IKE_SA_INIT` fails.
*   The vulnerability affects strongSwan releases 4.1.0 to 4.3.0
*   The issue was discovered in the `ike_sa.c` file.
*   The old stable distribution (etch) was not affected by these two problems (CVE-2009-1957 and CVE-2009-1958) because it lacks IKEv2 support.
