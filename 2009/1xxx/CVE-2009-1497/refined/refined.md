```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in GOM Player when processing subtitle files (.srt).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application fails to properly validate the length of the subtitle data, allowing for a buffer overflow when a specially crafted subtitle file is loaded.
- Impact of exploitation: The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) by causing the application to crash. This is a local denial of service and might be a starting point for remote code execution in further investigations.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is a specially crafted .srt subtitle file.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to provide the malicious subtitle file to the victim. The user must then load this file into the vulnerable GOM Player application.
