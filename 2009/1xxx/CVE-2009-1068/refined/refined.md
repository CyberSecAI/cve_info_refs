Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability in BS.Player when processing specially crafted `.bsl` playlist files, specifically within the hostname field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow. When a long hostname is provided in a `.bsl` file, it overwrites the stack, including the SEH (Structured Exception Handling) chain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By controlling the SEH chain, an attacker can redirect program execution to an attacker-controlled shellcode, resulting in arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running BS.Player.
- **Program Crash:** If exploitation is unsuccessful, it can lead to a crash of the BS.Player application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File:**  The primary attack vector is via a malicious `.bsl` playlist file, which the user must open with the vulnerable version of BS.Player.  This can be considered local or remote since .bsl files are associated with the program

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious .bsl File:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a `.bsl` file to include a long hostname string that triggers the buffer overflow.
- **User Interaction:** The victim user must open this malicious `.bsl` file with the vulnerable BS.Player application.
- **Knowledge of SEH:** The attacker needs knowledge of the SEH overwrite technique to reliably gain code execution.

**Technical Details:**

- The exploit overwrites the stack with a crafted payload, including the next SEH record, the SEH handler and the shellcode.
- The provided exploits use a `pop pop ret` address from a BS.Player DLL (`oldskin.dll` or `bsplayer.exe`) to redirect execution flow to the attacker-provided shellcode.
- The shellcode is designed to execute arbitrary commands (e.g. launching `calc.exe`).
- The exploits create a malicious `.bsl` file with the crafted payload.

**Versions Affected:**
- BS.Player 2.34 Build 980 and prior versions (including 2.32 Build 975).

**Versions Not Vulnerable:**
- BS.Player 2.35 Build 985 and later versions (including 2.36 Build 990).
