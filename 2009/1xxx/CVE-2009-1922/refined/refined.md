  "CVE-2009-1922": {
    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Windows Message Queuing service (MSMQ) due to a specific flaw in the parsing of an IOCTL request to the Message Queuing service. The MSMQ service improperly checks input data before passing them to the buffer. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The MSMQ service improperly validates input data before passing it to a buffer, specifically during the parsing of an IOCTL request.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Null pointer dereference (inferred)"
     ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, leading to complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted IOCTL request to the MSMQ service.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users. The Message Queuing component also needs to be manually installed by a user with administrative rights."
