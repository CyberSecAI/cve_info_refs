A badly formed zlib-stream can trigger this buffer overflow and cause the perl process at least to hang or to crash.  There is an e-mail virus in circulation that contains a zip file that causes such a memory corruption when being uncompressed using perl-applications that depend on Compress::Raw::Zlib. (E.g. spamassassin and amavisd-new.) (See <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.mail.virus.amavis.user/33635>.)
