#2009-006 Android improper package verification when using shared uids

Description:

Android, an open source mobile phone platform, improperly checks developer
certificates when installing packages that request the shared user identifier
(uid) permission.

Normally, Android applications will be allowed to share a uid if the
packages are all signed by the same developer certificate and request
permission to do so at install-time.  This allows for packages from the
same author to share data.  Without enforcement of that behavior, it is
possible for any application to be installed in such a manner that it
gains access to another (existing) application's data.

A patch has been made available by Android (see references).

Affected version:

Android >= 1.5 CRB17 <= 1.5 CRB42

Fixed version:

Android >= 1.5 CRB43
(Android 1.0 and 1.1 are not affected)
