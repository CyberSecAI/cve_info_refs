Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `usersettings.php` script of e107. This script doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input to the `hide[]` key, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. This occurs because user-supplied input is directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping. Specifically, the values of the `hide` POST parameter are being used to create a database query. The `implode("^", array_keys($_POST['hide']))` line combines the keys from the `hide` array into a string, and this is then inserted into an SQL update statement.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The script fails to use functions like `mysql_real_escape_string` (or equivalent for the database system used) to escape or sanitize the input provided in the `hide[]` POST parameter, making it vulnerable to SQL injection. The script uses `intval()` on the `user_extended_id`, but not the `hide[]` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other user details.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify or delete data stored in the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has higher privileges, an attacker might be able to gain control over the system.
- **Denial of Service:** While not directly mentioned, it's possible that a crafted SQL injection payload could cause performance issues, leading to a denial of service. This is shown in the exploit which uses `benchmark` to cause a time delay, which helps indicate successful exploitation in a blind context.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `usersettings.php` script.
- **`hide[]` Parameter:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `hide[]` POST parameter.
- **`ue[]` Parameter:**  A valid key of `ue[]` is needed from the user\_extended fields to trigger the vulnerable code in `usersettings.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the e107 system and able to log in. The attacker needs a valid username and password to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP POST requests to the e107 server's `usersettings.php` file.
- **Knowledge of `user_extended_fields`**: The attacker needs to know valid keys for `user_extended_fields` such as `aim` or `msn` to use in the `ue[]` POST variable.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided exploit uses a blind SQL injection technique using time-based attacks with `benchmark()`.
- The exploit code iterates through different fields to check for a suitable field that triggers the vulnerability.
- The exploit performs a brute-force attack to retrieve the user's password hash.
- The exploit targets `e107` versions `<= 0.7.15`.
