- **Root cause of vulnerability**:
    - **CVE-2009-1465**: The Application Access Server (A-A-S) uses an undocumented default password of "wildbat" for the admin account, granting full access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **CVE-2009-1465**: Default admin password with full rights.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **CVE-2009-1465**: An attacker can gain full control of the system by using the default admin password, allowing them to execute commands, stop services, kill processes, and potentially install malware.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **CVE-2009-1465**: Exploiting the default password would require the attacker to know or guess that the server is using A-A-S and not changed the default admin password
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - **CVE-2009-1465**: The attacker needs to know the default password or must have previously installed A-A-S using the default configuration. They also need network access to the A-A-S server.
