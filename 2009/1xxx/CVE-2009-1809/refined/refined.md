    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2009-1809",
      "is_related": true,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple modules.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "SQL Injection",
          "Authentication Bypass via SQLi",
          "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication, extract sensitive information from the database, and execute arbitrary code by injecting SQL commands. An attacker can also inject malicious scripts via XSS, potentially leading to session hijacking or further compromise.",
        "attack_vectors": {
          "sql_injection": "By manipulating the 'Name' field in the login form or by manipulating 'ID' parameter in various modules.",
          "xss": "By injecting malicious scripts in various parameters like month, year, Page, Kontext, or image."
        },
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft specific SQL injection payloads and XSS payloads via web requests. For SQL injection, a registered user is required for some modules, though authentication bypass is possible through SQL injection even without initial registration. For XSS, no prior authentication is necessary.",
         "additional_info": "The exploit database entry provides detailed proof-of-concept URLs that can be used to trigger these vulnerabilities. It also mentions that magic quotes being off makes the SQLi easier to exploit for authentication bypass"
