Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-1098:

**Root Cause:**
*   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) when processing GIF images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which occurs when the program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer size. This is triggered during the processing of GIF image data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges. Specifically:
    *   An untrusted applet or Java Web Start application can gain the ability to read and write local files.
    *   An attacker can execute local applications with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable Java process.
    *   The vulnerability may lead to denial-of-service due to application crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack via Untrusted Applets:** An attacker can embed the specially crafted GIF image within an untrusted applet. If a user runs this applet, the vulnerability can be triggered.
*   **Remote Attack via Java Web Start Applications:** Similarly, malicious GIF images can be included in Java Web Start applications. If a user runs such an application, they become vulnerable.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must be tricked into loading/running either a malicious applet or a Java Web Start application containing the malicious GIF image for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious GIF Images:** The attacker needs the technical ability to create a GIF image that triggers the buffer overflow.
*   **Ability to Distribute Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to distribute the malicious content via a mechanism that will entice users to run it, such as a malicious website hosting a malicous applet, or by a malicious Java web start application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically tied to processing GIF image files.
*   The vulnerability can lead to remote code execution, which allows an attacker to gain control of the vulnerable system.
*   Multiple sources mention that this vulnerability can result in a denial of service.
*   The vulnerability is reported across different Java implementations (Sun, IBM, OpenJDK)

**Affected Products (as per the provided documents):**

*   IBM JDK 5
*   Sun Java 5 and 6 (JDK and JRE)
*   OpenJDK
*   Multiple Linux distributions (e.g., openSUSE, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, etc.) using these Java implementations, often via applets or web start applications.
*   Avaya products that may rely on underlying vulnerable Java implementations on a generic-purpose OS.
*   VMWare ESX / VCenter.

This vulnerability can be triggered by an untrusted applet or Java Web Start application with a crafted GIF image. Successful exploitation leads to privilege escalation with the ability to read/write files or execute local applications.
