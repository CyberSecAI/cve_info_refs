{
  "CVE-2009-1827": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is due to an unclamped loop when processing SVG circle elements with extremely large radius values, which can cause a denial-of-service condition by making the browser unresponsive.",
    "Root cause": "An unclamped loop occurs within the SVG rendering engine when processing very large radius values for circle elements, leading to an infinite loop and subsequent denial of service.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unclamped loop vulnerability when processing SVG circle elements",
      "Lack of input validation or sanitization of SVG radius values"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service condition, causing the browser to become unresponsive and potentially leading to loss of unsaved work.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious SVG file or embed it within a web page. When a user attempts to render this malicious SVG file using a vulnerable browser, the browser hangs due to the infinite loop. The attack vector is through loading the crafted SVG file either locally or remotely via a website.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to deliver a specially crafted SVG file to the victim. This can be achieved by hosting the malicious SVG file on a website, through social engineering to convince a user to open a malicious file, or embedding it within an email."
