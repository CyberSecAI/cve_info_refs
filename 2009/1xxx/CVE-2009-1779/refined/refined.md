{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient authentication checks in `server.php` and insecure handling of user-supplied data in `admin.php` when constructing the configuration file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass due to inadequate checks in `server.php`.",
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability due to the inclusion of the user-supplied `$form_include_template` variable without proper sanitization.",
      "Code injection vulnerability due to the injection of the user-supplied `$form_aula` variable into the generated PHP configuration file."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can bypass authentication, include malicious remote files for arbitrary code execution, and inject arbitrary PHP code into the configuration file. This can lead to complete compromise of the web application and server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Authentication bypass: By sending a request to `admin.php` with the `submit` parameter and modified username and password parameters, an attacker can change the admin credentials.",
       "RFI: By sending a crafted request to `admin.php` with the `submit` parameter and a malicious URL in the `form_include_template` parameter, an attacker can include a malicious remote file.",
      "Code injection: By sending a crafted request to `admin.php` with the `submit` parameter and arbitrary PHP code in the `form_aula` parameter, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code in the configuration file."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.  For RFI to work, `allow_url_fopen` must be enabled on the server and for code injection, `magic_quotes_gpc` must be disabled."
