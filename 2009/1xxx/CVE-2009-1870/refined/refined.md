**2. Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of this vulnerability is a flaw in the Adobe Flash Player sandbox that allows for information disclosure. Specifically, when SWF files are saved to the hard drive, the sandbox is not properly implemented, leading to potential exposure of data.
*   **Weakness:** The core weakness is the insufficient isolation provided by the Adobe Flash Player sandbox, allowing data to be potentially accessed when SWF files are saved to disk.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can exploit this weakness to potentially leak sensitive information when SWF files are saved to the hard drive through information disclosure.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves tricking a user into viewing a malicious web site that then saves the specially crafted SWF file to disk and exposes information.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted SWF file that, when saved to disk, could leak sensitive information.
