Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2009-1837:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists in the `NPObjWrapper_NewResolve` function within the Mozilla Firefox browser. This occurs when the browser is accessing the properties of an `NPObject` (which is a JavaScript wrapped object, often from a plugin like Java).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The core issue is that when navigating away from a web page that is loading a Java applet (or other plugin), the plugin's object might be destroyed while Firefox is still trying to access its properties. This leads to accessing freed memory.
- **Use-After-Free:** The race condition can result in the browser attempting to read from or write to a memory region that has already been deallocated, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Lack of Proper Synchronization/Guards:** The code did not have sufficient protection against the destruction of the plugin object while still trying to call into it, allowing a race condition to be triggered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain the ability to write arbitrary code to the freed memory before it is reused. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially taking complete control.
- **Browser Crash:** In many cases, the immediate result of this vulnerability is a crash of the Firefox browser due to the invalid memory access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Page Navigation:** The primary attack vector involves loading a malicious web page that loads a Java applet. If a user navigates away from the page (e.g., by clicking the back button) during the applet loading process, the race condition can be triggered.
- **Specially Crafted Web Page:** The attacker must craft a web page to load a vulnerable plugin in such a way that the race condition occurs when the user navigates away.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Web Content:** The attacker must be able to host malicious content on a web server accessible to the victim.
- **Target User Interaction:** The attacker needs the victim to visit the malicious web page with a vulnerable version of Firefox.
- **Timing:** The exploitation relies on specific timing of the navigation away from the page during the applet loading process. This might require some trial and error.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** Attacker has to have the knowledge that this vulnerability can be exploited using java applet and firefox browser.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**
- The vulnerability is reported by Secunia Research, specifically by Jakob Balle and Carsten Eiram.
- The issue affects Firefox 3.x and not Firefox 2.x or earlier versions. The reason it did not exist in Firefox 2 is because it didn't allow navigating away from the page while the applet was loading. Firefox 3.x and later versions allowed it.
- The fix involves adding plugin destruction guards (mutexes or similar constructs) to the code accessing the NPObject which will prevent the plugin from being destroyed until those accesses complete.
- The fix for 1.9.1 branch (Firefox 3.0.11) includes a fix for the issue.
- Red Hat also issued security advisories (RHSA-2009:1095) to address this issue in their products.
