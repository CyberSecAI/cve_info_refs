Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-1430:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Alert Originator service (iao.exe) of Symantec products.
*   The service listens on TCP port 38292 by default.
*   The service copies user-supplied data to a stack buffer using a `memcpy` call without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:**  The `memcpy` call copies data into a fixed-size stack buffer without validating the size of the incoming data. This allows an attacker to write beyond the bounds of the buffer.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The service blindly copies data without proper size validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:**  Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
*   **System user context:** The code execution happens in the context of the SYSTEM user, giving the attacker full control over the machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending a specially crafted packet over the network to TCP port 38292.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any form of authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the vulnerable system on TCP port 38292.
*   **Crafted packet:** The attacker needs to be able to create and send a specially crafted packet to trigger the overflow.

**Affected Products:**
* Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition
* Symantec Client Security
* Symantec Endpoint Protection

**Additional Information:**
*  Symantec released a patch to address this vulnerability.
*  The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2007-09-14
*  Coordinated public release of advisory was on 2009-04-28
*  Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '5959'.
