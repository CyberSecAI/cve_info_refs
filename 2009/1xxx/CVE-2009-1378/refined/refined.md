{
  "CVE-2009-1378": {
    "Description": "Multiple memory leaks in the dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message function in ssl/d1_both.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8k and earlier 0.9.8 versions allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via DTLS records that (1) are duplicates or (2) have sequence numbers much greater than current sequence numbers, aka \"DTLS fragment handling memory leak.\"",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message` function within `ssl/d1_both.c`. This function failed to check if an incoming message fragment was already buffered. Consequently, it allocated memory for every new message, including duplicates and those with out-of-sequence numbers, leading to memory exhaustion.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak",
      "Improper input validation",
       "Lack of duplicate message detection"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by exhausting the server's memory by sending a large volume of specially crafted DTLS handshake messages, eventually leading to service disruption.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via network by sending malformed DTLS packets.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
