How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- IBMJava5-JRE/java-1\_5\_0-ibm
The update brings IBM Java 5 to SR9-SSU.
It fixes a lot of security issues:
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with storing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to consume a disproportionate amount of disk space resulting
in a denial-of-service condition.
CVE-2009-1100: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
with processing temporary font files may allow an untrusted applet or
application to retain temporary files resulting in a denial-of-service
condition.
CVE-2009-1103: A vulnerability in the Java Plug-in with deserializing
applets may allow an untrusted applet to escalate privileges. For
example, an untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and
write local files or execute local applications that are accessible to
the user running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1104: The Java Plug-in allows Javascript code that is loaded
from the localhost to connect to any port on the system. This may be
leveraged together with XSS vulnerabilities in a blended attack to
access other applications listening on ports other than the one where
the Javascript code was served from.
CVE-2009-1093: A vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with
initializing LDAP connections may be exploited by a remote client to
cause a denial-of-service condition on the LDAP service.
CVE-2009-1094: A vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment LDAP client
implementation may allow malicious data from an LDAP server to cause
malicious code to be unexpectedly loaded and executed on an LDAP client.
CVE-2009-1107: The Java Plugin displays a warning dialog for signed
applets. A signed applet can obscure the contents of the dialog and trick
a user into trusting the applet.
CVE-2009-1095
CVE-2009-1096: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the Java Runtime
Environment (JRE) with unpacking applets and Java Web Start applications
using the unpack200 JAR unpacking utility may allow an untrusted applet
or application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted applet
may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or execute
local applications that are accessible to the user running the untrusted
applet.
CVE-2009-1098: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing GIF images may allow an untrusted applet or
Java Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an
untrusted applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local
files or execute local applications that are accessible to the user
running the untrusted applet.
CVE-2009-1099: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the Java Runtime
Environment with processing fonts may allow an untrusted applet or Java
Web Start application to escalate privileges. For example, an untrusted
applet may grant itself permissions to read and write local files or
execute local applications that are accessible to the user running the
untrusted applet.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

In dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message() the check if the current message
is already buffered was missing. For every new message was memory
allocated, allowing an attacker to perform an denial of service attack
with sending out of seq handshake messages until there is no memory
left. Additionally every future messege was buffered, even if the
sequence number made no sense and would be part of another handshake.
So only messages with sequence numbers less than 10 in advance will be
buffered.

Thanks to Daniel Mentz for finding this bug!

 *   allowing an attacker to perform an denial of service attack with sending
 *   out of seq handshake messages until there is no memory left.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *   Pass the host and port of the target DTLS server:
 *
 *   $ gcc cve-2009-1378.c -o cve-2009-1378
 *   $ ./cve-2009-1378 1.2.3.4 666
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *   With a MTU of 1500, the attack leaks 1503 bytes of memory with each UDP
 *   datagram.  If you have a bigger MTU than 1500, feel free to set it.
 *
 *   Complete memory exhaustion may take a while depending on the throughput
 *   to the target and the amount of memory it has.  By default, we'll just
 *   continue sending datagrams indefinitely.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# CVE 2009-1378

Multiple memory leaks in the dtls1\_process\_out\_of\_seq\_message function in ssl/d1\_both.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8k and earlier 0.9.8 versions allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via DTLS records that (1) are duplicates or (2) have sequence numbers much greater than current sequence numbers, aka "DTLS fragment handling memory leak."

# OpenSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200912-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL might allow remote attackers to conduct
multiple attacks, including the injection of arbitrary data into encrypted
byte streams.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.8l-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.8l-r2** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenSSL:

* Marsh Ray of PhoneFactor and Martin Rex of SAP independently
  reported that the TLS protocol does not properly handle session
  renegotiation requests (CVE-2009-3555).
* The MD2 hash algorithm is no longer considered to be
  cryptographically strong, as demonstrated by Dan Kaminsky. Certificates
  using this algorithm are no longer accepted (CVE-2009-2409).
* Daniel Mentz and Robin Seggelmann reported the following
  vulnerabilities related to DTLS: A use-after-free flaw (CVE-2009-1379)
  and a NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2009-1387) in the
  dtls1\_retrieve\_buffered\_fragment() function in src/d1\_both.c, multiple
  memory leaks in the dtls1\_process\_out\_of\_seq\_message() function in
  src/d1\_both.c (CVE-2009-1378), and a processing error related to a
  large amount of DTLS records with a future epoch in the
  dtls1\_buffer\_record() function in ssl/d1\_pkt.c
  (CVE-2009-1377).

### Impact

A remote unauthenticated attacker, acting as a Man in the Middle, could
inject arbitrary plain text into a TLS session, possibly leading to the
ability to send requests as if authenticated as the victim. A remote
attacker could furthermore send specially crafted DTLS packages to a
service using OpenSSL for DTLS support, possibly resulting in a Denial
of Service. Also, a remote attacker might be able to create rogue
certificates, facilitated by a MD2 collision. NOTE: The amount of
computation needed for this attack is still very large.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8l-r2"
```

Subject: Two OpenSSL DTLS remote DoS

Spotted on openssl-dev, two issues that can lead to a remote attacker
exhausting memory of a DTLS enabled service.  DTLS support was introduced
in OpenSSL 0.9.8.

CVE-2009-1377 DTLS epoch record buffer memory DoS

## Details

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not limit the number of DTLS records it

would buffer when they arrived with a future epoch. A remote attacker could

cause a denial of service via memory resource consumption by sending a

large number of crafted requests. ([CVE-2009-1377](/security/CVE-2009-1377))

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly free memory when processing

DTLS fragments. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service via

memory resource consumption by sending a large number of crafted requests.

([CVE-2009-1378](/security/CVE-2009-1378))

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly handle certain server

certificates when processing DTLS packets. A remote DTLS server could cause

a denial of service by sending a message containing a specially crafted

server certificate. ([CVE-2009-1379](/security/CVE-2009-1379))

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly handle a DTLS

ChangeCipherSpec packet when it occured before ClientHello. A remote

attacker could cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted

request. ([CVE-2009-1386](/security/CVE-2009-1386))

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly handle out of sequence

DTLS handshake messages. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service

by sending a specially crafted request. ([CVE-2009-1387](/security/CVE-2009-1387))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
