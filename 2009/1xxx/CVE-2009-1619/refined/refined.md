{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure cookie handling",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application uses an insecure cookie for authentication, specifically 'twFSadmin', which can be easily manipulated by an attacker.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can set the 'twFSadmin' cookie to '1', which grants them administrative access to the application. This allows them to bypass authentication and potentially perform malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed client-side by manipulating the cookie. The attacker uses Javascript to inject a cookie with admin privileges.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to execute Javascript in the context of the vulnerable website. This could be achieved by the attacker injecting Javascript into the browser or by convincing a victim to run malicious javascript."
