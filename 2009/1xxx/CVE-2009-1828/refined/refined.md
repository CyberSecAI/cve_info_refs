{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `<keygen>` tag in HTML, when combined with JavaScript `onload()` or a meta refresh, can cause an infinite loop by repeatedly submitting the public key as an argument to the current URI. This results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, potentially with memory leaks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption due to the infinite loop.",
      "Memory leaks during key generation and submission."
    ],
    "impact": "The browser becomes unresponsive to user input, tabs become inaccessible, and user work might be lost. Restarting the browser and restoring the previous session may re-trigger the loop. The DoS condition consumes significant CPU and memory resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious website can use the `<keygen>` tag with a javascript onload or meta refresh to cause an infinite loop within the victim's browser.",
        "A malicious website can consume memory resources of the victim by repeatedly triggering the key generation."
    ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML page with the vulnerable code.",
        "The attacker needs to entice a victim to visit the page."
    ]
  },
  "additional_details": {
      "exploits_available": "Exploit code is publicly available at milw0rm.com and websecurity.com.ua",
      "affected_browsers": "This vulnerability affects Mozilla Firefox 3.0.10 and possibly all Firefox versions supporting the `<keygen>` tag. Other browsers like Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Opera were also found to be vulnerable to a similar type of DoS via resource consumption",
      "workaround": "A user can close the keygen generation dialog box and the affected tab quickly to mitigate the DoS but it is not a complete fix.",
    "resolution": "The bug was marked as WONTFIX due to the eventual removal of the `<keygen>` tag.",
      "memory_corruption": "While the primary issue was the DoS, memory corruption was also observed in some cases, but not consistently reproducible. The issue was reported to cause crashes in the nssdbm3.dll module."
