## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

I can definitely confirm the denial of service aspect, and there's a very minor memory leak (after 9 hours of CPU time memory use went from 60MB to 360MB).

In case there are more than one security modules used, FF forces to make a selection between two or more security modules every time. It's possible to save an open work, close the browser and the selection box thereafter. An easy work-around and temporary fix could to force selection even with one security module.

Hello!
As I wrote at my site (<http://websecurity.com.ua/3194/>), not just only Firefox, but also Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Opera are vulnerable.
After DoS vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox found by Thierry Zoller was posted, I checked it in other browsers and found that this Denial of Service vulnerability also exists in Internet Explorer and Google Chrome. And also I made new version of exploit which works in Opera.
Attack belongs to type of DoS (<http://websecurity.com.ua/2550/>) via resources consumption (in all mentioned browsers), and also freezing or blocking (differently in different browsers).
DoS:
[http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2009/Firefox,%20IE%20&%20Chrome%20DoS%20Exploit.html](http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2009/Firefox%2C%20IE%20%26%20Chrome%20DoS%20Exploit.html)
[http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2009/Firefox,%20IE,%20Chrome%20&%20Opera%20DoS%20Exploit.html](http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2009/Firefox%2C%20IE%2C%20Chrome%20%26%20Opera%20DoS%20Exploit.html)
Firefox blocks (at that consumes CPU resources), so it's become impossible to use it and it's only possible to close it. IE consumes CPU resources and freezes. Chrome only consumes CPU resources. Opera blocks, at that consumes CPU resources (in second exploit).

Hi Mustlive,
First thank you for giving credit. Secondly I have to make a few comments, bugzilla isn't really the place to discuss third party vendor bugs, but let me comment :
- IE doesn't support the keygen tag at all (afaik), what you are doing is continuously submitting a form. In IE8 this leads to no blocking or anything
to be considered a DoS.
- In chrome I could not reproduce, I don't think they support the keygen tag
(so see above)
- Haven't tested Opera, maybe it's another DoS. Feel free to post it to Bugtraq or Fulldisclosure.

I find you can close the keygen generation and close the problematic tab before it opens again. So it's not /that/ bad.

Hello Thierry!
You are welcome.
> bugzilla isn't really the place to discuss third party vendor bugs
Before I wrote to bugzilla, I sent you a letter (to Thierry(at)Zoller.lu) with details about these vulnerabilities (my previous post was small version of that letter). So you could just answer on my letter :-).
I understand that bugzilla is not appropriate place for such discussion, but here is why I did that post. First, in case if you didn't receive my letter, than you can view small version of it here. Second, to show Mozilla and other browsers developers that this is not just problem of one browser, but of many browser. Which must stimulate them to fix this hole in their browsers (multiple vulnerable browsers case must make some influence on all browser developer).
Besides, I am glad that Mozilla (in the person of Daniel Veditz) very quickly answered on your bugzilla post (only after 3 days). For example on my last bugzilla post about <a href="[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=493858](/show_bug.cgi?id=493858 "RESOLVED INVALID - object/embed params not inherited by nested object/embed")">Properties not-inheritance vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox</a>, which I made at 19.05.2009, there is no answer to present day. This situation brightly shows how Mozilla "fixing vulnerabilities in 10 days" (via just ignoring them).

Thierry, at my site and in my letter which I wrote to you, I wrote which versions of browsers are vulnerable.
Vulnerable are Mozilla Firefox 3.0.10, Internet Explorer 6 (6.0.2900.2180), Internet Explorer 7 (7.0.6000.16711), Google Chrome 1.0.154.48, Opera 9.52 and previous versions of these browsers (and possible next versions).
> IE doesn't support the keygen tag at all (afaik)
Before your post I even didn't know about keygen tag at all (and so didn't know that any browser support it). As I checked IE6 vulnerable to this attack (regardless to support of this tag), and after my post about this vulnerability I found (at the end of last week), that IE7 is also vulnerable.
> what you are doing is continuously submitting a form.
It's in second exploit. It's to make blocking DoS in Opera. See my Classification of DoS vulnerabilities in browsers (<http://websecurity.com.ua/2550/>).
I made a lot of such blocking DoS exploits for different browsers (Firefox, IE, Opera and Chrome) in last and this year. None browser vendor fixed any of these blocking DoS (like any other DoS hole which I found) in their browsers.
> In IE8 this leads to no blocking or anything to be considered a DoS.
Than IE8 is not vulnerable. Unlike IE6 and IE7.
> In chrome I could not reproduce, I don't think they support the keygen tag (so see above)
As I mentioned above, vulnerable Google Chrome 1.0.154.48 (and previous versions). And Chrome consumes CPU resources (regardless to support of this tag), so look at % of used CPU in Chrome or in Task Manager.
> Haven't tested Opera, maybe it's another DoS. Feel free to post it to Bugtraq
or Fulldisclosure.
Opera is vulnerable to, as I wrote.
I mostly not post to Bugtraq (there are very small number of my post to this list) and never posted to Fulldisclosure. Didn't post to Bugtraq about these vulnerabilities in Firefox, IE, Chrome and Opera, nor about my last post about vulnerabilities in Firefox, Internet Explorer and Opera (<http://websecurity.com.ua/3216/>), not about many other holes in browser which I found in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Except those posts about Saved XSS vulnerability in IE6 and IE7. But I'll think about it.

> I find you can close the keygen generation and close the problematic tab before it opens again. So it's not /that/ bad.
When I was checking Thierry's exploit before posting about vulnerabilities in different browsers on last week, I also found possibility to close (quickly) keygen generation window, and so to eliminate this exploit (without closing of tab or browser).
For this reason I made new version of exploit (look at my second exploit). Which is harder one (for all browsers) and also works in Opera. So try to use my second exploit mentioned above ;-).

I wasn't trying to substract importance to it, it's still a bug. And the fact that you can escape it, probably not intentional. A solution to it would simply be adding a Cancel button to the keygen window (not complete since you could produce a loop but a big step).

I wanted to close my browser anyway, so gave it a try :)
So I tried both

and they aren't difficuly to close. Thierry's POC at this bug url is harder.
Just do Alt+F4 (keygen window closes) and close the tab.
I also tried your [http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2009/Firefox,%20IE%20&%20Opera%20DoS%20Exploit.html](http://websecurity.com.ua/uploads/2009/Firefox%2C%20IE%20%26%20Opera%20DoS%20Exploit.html)
but I don't seem to be vulnerable. :)
Firefox simply shows a parsing error (not element found), line 228891.

Hello Nim!
> Just do Alt+F4 (keygen window closes) and close the tab.
I do it with mouse only ;-). In any case (with keyboard or with mouse) you need to close keygen window and tab very quickly, because keygen generation process will begin again. And taking into account that 99,99% of Internet users have no such knowledge, then their browsers will be DoSed with this attack.
> Thierry's POC at this bug url is harder.
Nim, my first exploit it's the same Thierry's exploit (with my additional html codes, like title and comment). So it's your subjective opinion :-). Besides, my second exploit works in Opera.

Man, Firefox is vulnerable (all versions). After that hole was found, Mozilla ignored it and didn't fix it in 3.0.9 and 3.0.10. If you get such result (just error message), then it's because not full xml file was loaded (and it's 228 KB). So just reload page (make full reload). Or download both html and xml file to your PC and run locally (you can download them from my site or download rar with these files from milw0rm). I had feelings that such situation (with error message) is possible. For this reason for attack is better to use fast server.
P.S.
As I recently checked in Firefox 3.0.11, these last two DoS vulnerabilities in it (which I mentioned above) were not fixed in version 3.0.11.

It's just a matter of the time between one run and the second. Obviously, the computer used matters here.

I confirm the crashing bug in Firefox 3.0.11
However, in trunk it gives the 'Parsing error' I described above. Some parser change may be enmascarading it. I got it to crash once, but couldn't reproduce.

That duplicate is public, fwiw, which might have the effect of opening this bug up. :(

for reference, the crash listed is here:
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/dbm/src/h_func.c&rev=3.2&mark=195,173,172#165>
the caller is this:
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/dbm/src/hash.c&rev=3.23&mark=784#762>
So the signature is: [@ hash4 - hash\_access]
past that point, isn't particularly easy for me to rebuild (.dmp files are appreciated...). Assuming that the listed frame is noise, the next call site is here:
2100 keydb\_Get(NSSLOWKEYDBHandle \*kdb, DBT \*key, DBT \*data, unsigned int flags)
2110 ret = (\* db->get)(db, key, data, flags);
But without a .dmp file, it isn't worth it for me to spend time speculating.
reporter: in the future, please consider looking at <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/How_to_get_a_stacktrace_with_WinDbg>
the instructions would also enable you to get better crash reports for IE ([comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=469565#c0 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Keygen Tag endless loop and (not always reproducable) Memory corruption [@ NSSRWLock_LockRead_Util]")). But they'd especially improve your ability to report issues to us.

How about unhiding [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=469565#c0 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Keygen Tag endless loop and (not always reproducable) Memory corruption [@ NSSRWLock_LockRead_Util]") here? [Comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=469565#c6 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Keygen Tag endless loop and (not always reproducable) Memory corruption [@ NSSRWLock_LockRead_Util]") (mentioned in Whiteboard field) was written half a year ago...
I guess [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=469565#c0 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Keygen Tag endless loop and (not always reproducable) Memory corruption [@ NSSRWLock_LockRead_Util]") includes the same information as is in URL field of this bug and/or [bug 498919 comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=498919#c0 "VERIFIED DUPLICATE - Use of keygen tag to create an infinite loop"), right?

When FF3.5 is open, cpu eventually runs 99%, using over 100,000K of memory. Closing FF does not stop the cpu or memory usage. Closing with Task Manager is the only way to exit FF. Previous versions of FF all ran stable, problem started with 3.5. Closing and restarting does not solve the problem. Removing program and reinstalling clean does not solve anything. Same settings were used from previous version to install FF3.5.
Once cpu maxes out, FF ties up entire computer.

I found the same bug today: (sorry didn't show up on search)
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=546308](/show_bug.cgi?id=546308 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - <keygen> dos & stability issues.")
Although my approach was somewhat more extreme in the sense of the Key3.db gets clogged up. That alone is in my honest opinion a reason to have a good look at the issue, since I find it undesirable for having a JavaScript writing to Key3.db without limitation whatsoever (at least it seems that way).

________________________________________________________________________

              From the very-low-hanging-fruit-department
                   Firefox Denial of Service (KEYGEN)
________________________________________________________________________

Release mode: Forced release.
Ref         : [TZO-27-2009] - Firefox Denial of Service (KEYGEN)
WWW         : http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/advisory-firefox-denial-of-service.html
Vendor      : http://www.firefox.com
Status      : No patch
CVE         : none provided
Credit      : none
Bugzilla entry: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=469565

Security notification reaction rating : There wasn't any appropriate reaction.
Notification to patch window : x+n

Disclosure Policy : http://blog.zoller.lu/2008/09/notification-and-disclosure-policy.html

Affected products :
- Firefox 3.0.10 (Windows)
- Likely : All Firefox versions supporting the KEYGEN tag.

I. Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Firefox is a popular Internet browser from the Mozilla Corporation. In 2007 the
Mozilla Corporation had a revenue of over 75 million dollars [1], out of
which 68 million where made with a search advertising deal, in other words with
the search box in Firefox that defaults to Google.

I envy the spirit of everyone that works on Firefox code in their spare time,
for free.

II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This bug is a simple design bug that results in an endless loop (and interesting
memory leaks).

Once upon a time Netscape thought it would be a great idea to add the keygen tag
(<keygen>) as a feature to their Browser. The keygen tag offers a simple way
of automatically generating key material using various algorithms. For instance
it is possible to generate RSA, DSA and EC key material.

"The public key and challenge string are DER encoded as PublicKeyAndChallenge and
then digitally signed with the private key to produce a SignedPublicKeyAndChallenge.
The SignedPublicKeyAndChallenge is base64 encoded, and the ASCII data is finally
submitted to the server as the value of a name-value pair, where the name is
specified by the NAME attribute of the KEYGEN tag."

More information: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTML/HTML_Extensions/KEYGEN_Tag

This feature includes the automatic submission of the public part to a script,
the crux. The Keygen tag reloads the document by submitting the public key as an argument
to the current URI. Combining this with a javascript body onload() call
(or meta refresh) results in an neat endless loop blocking access to the UI.

Furthermore memory is leaked during the process.

III. Impact
~~~~~~~~~~
The browser doesn't respond any longer to any user input, tabs are no
longer accessible, your work if any might be lost. Restarting the
Firefox process and restoring the previous Firefox session will
re-spawn the tab and start the loop again.

According to a Bugzilla entry memory is also leaked during the process.

So let's recap, we have a function that generates key material and looping
causes memory to leak. One might think this should be important enough
to investigate, especially if you know that for DSA for instance, only
a few bits of k can reveal an entire private key. [3]

Note: I am not saying the memory leaks include key material, seeing the lack
of interest this bugzilla ticket triggered, I have not considered investigating
further.  What  I  am  saying  is  that if security is taken seriously
memory leaks that directly or indirectly happen during key generation
need to be investigated thoroughly.

IV. Proof of concept (hold your breath)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<html>
<body onLoad="document.forms[0].submit()">
<FORM>
<KEYGEN NAME="somekey" CHALLENGE="1125983021">
<INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="SubmitButton" VALUE="Done">
</FORM>
</html>

Live : http://secdev.zoller.lu/ff_dos_keygen.html

IV. Disclosure timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DD/MM/YYYY
14/12/2008 : Created bugzilla entry (security) with (the wrong) proof of concept
             file.

14/12/2008 : Attached the correct POC file (mea culpa) and a stack trace and details
             of memory corruption that repeatedly occurred during testing the POC

24/12/2008 : dveditz@mozilla.com comments : "I can definitely confirm the denial
             of service aspect, and there's a very minor memory leak (after 9
             hours of CPU time memory use went from 60MB to 360MB). Haven't been
             able to reproduce a crash."

27/05/2009 : The 4 month grace period [2] given is reached. Release of this advisory.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Comment:

I have received interesting and mixed feedback from posting the above "bug".

* First I'd like to clarify that a vulnerability is measured by the impact it causes, not how easy it is to find it and not by how technically challenging a vulnerability is.
* Secondly, vendors appear to not like it but remotely controlling the availability of an application is a security issue. It is the A in the CIA concept. If you are interested in that discussion I wrote a [small blog](http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/01/open-letter-remove-a-in-cia-or-venting.html) rant about the "Denial of service is not a security issue" mindset of certain vendors.
* Is this bug a vulnerability? - yes. Is is critical ? Clearly no. Stop seeing the world in Black or White. Something can be a vulnerability and still not be critical for the general public. However make no mistake, some bugs that are (for example) rated medium can become critical for certain companies that use the products in certain ways or critical parts of an infrastructure rely on that particular application.
* This is the reason I give no risk rating, what for ? I can't assess the risk an customer runs in specific environments when this vulnerability hits the product, I have no way to assess the risk whatsoever. I think it is highly misleading to have a vendor rate risk for a vulnerability. What I give is a description of the impact, with an description of the impact the customer of that product is actually able to assesses the risk, he is the only one that can.
* To illustrate this point take the bug above and think about several scenarios where this bug might actually pose a problem. Have one ? Fine. I have one too; what about for example Internet Kiosk vendors ? i.e the terminals at airports or cities that give access to the internet. Browse to the PoC and the terminal can no longer be used - so, for terminals offering pay for access service, this might mean actually income loss. (I am aware that some "restart" the whole OS or the envrionment periodicaly to clean up the mess left behind) Still I think you'll get the point here, there are a lot more scenarios like this.

  There is more then the typical End-user at home sitting before his pc that kills the process and restarts firefox.
* During my years doing security consultancy, one of the most astonishing things I learned is the immense variety of how applications are used by different companies. There is no way to summarise risk.

Release mode : Forced releaseRef : [TZO-27-2009] - Firefox Denial of Service (KEYGEN)Vendor : http://www.firefox.com Status : No patchCVE : none providedCredit : noneBugzilla entry: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=469565>Security notification reaction rating : There wasn't any appropriate reaction.Notification to patch window : x+n
Disclosure Policy : <http://blog.zoller.lu/2008/09/notification-and-disclosure-policy.html>

Affected products :
- Firefox 3.0.10 (Windows)
- probably all versions that support the keygen tag.

**I. Background**

Firefox is a popular internet browser from the Mozilla Corporation. In 2007 the Mozilla Corporation had a revenue of over 75 million dollars [1], out of which 68 million where made with a search advertising deal, in other words with the search box in Firefox that defaults to Google.

I envy the spirit of everyone that works on Firefox code in their spare time,for free.
**II. Description**

This bug is a simple design bug that results in an endless loop (and interesting memory leaks). Once upon a time Netscape thought it would be a great idea to add the keygen tag (KEYGEN) as a feature to their Browser. The keygen tag offers a simple way of automatically generating key material using various algorithms. For instance it is possible to generate RSA, DSA and EC key material.

"The public key and challenge string are DER encoded as PublicKeyAndChallenge and then digitally signed with the private key to produce a SignedPublicKeyAndChallenge. The SignedPublicKeyAndChallenge is base64 encoded, and the ASCII data is finally submitted to the server as the value of a name-value pair, where the name is specified by the NAME attribute of the KEYGEN tag."

More information: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTML/HTML\_Extensions/KEYGEN\_Tag

This feature includes the automatic submission of the public part to a script, the crux. The Keygen tag reloads the document by submiting the public key as an argument to the current URI. Combining this with a javascript body onload() call (or meta refresh) results in an neat endless loop blocking access to the UI.

Furthermore memory is leaked during the process.

**III. Impact**

The browser doesn't respond any longer to any user input, tabs are no longer accessible, your work if any might be lost. According to a Bugzilla entry memory is also leaked during the process.

So let's recap, we have a function that generates key material and looping causes memory to leak. One might think this should be important enough to investigate, especially if you know that for DSA for instance, only a few bits of k can reveal an entire private key. [3]

Note: I am not saying the memory leaks include key material, seeing the lack of interest this bugzilla ticket triggered, I have not considered investigating further. What I am saying is that if security is taken seriously such bugs need to be investigated thoroughly.
**IV. Proof of concept**

**IV. Disclosure timeline**

DD/MM/YYYY

* 14/12/2008 : Created bugzilla entry (security) with (the wrong) proof of concept file.
* 14/12/2008 : Attached the correct POC file (mea culpa) and a stack trace and details of memory corruption that repeatitly occured during testing the POC
* 24/12/2008 : dveditz@mozilla.com comments : "I can definitely confirm the denial of service aspect, and there's a very minor memory leak (after 9 hours of CPU time memory use went from 60MB to 360MB). Haven't been able to reproduce a crash."
* 27/05/2009 : The 4 month grace period [2] given is reached. Release of this advisory.

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

# BMO/UserGuide

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

You've probably noticed that BMO has a lot going on. We'll now delve into some more details of various definitions, features, and processes in BMO.

For people working on Firefox, please see [the Bug Handling section in the in-tree documentation for information on how to triage and make decisions on bugs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/index.html).

Finally, this is a work in progress (and may always be, since BMO is improving all the time). There are many stubs (indicated by italics).

# Creating a Bugzilla Account

To fully use all of the features of bugzilla.mozilla.org and most importantly, to file a new bug you will need to create an account. Currently there are two ways to do this.

## Create a Local Account

From the homepage, click "new account," which will let you create an account directly. You will need a valid email address. An email will be sent that will provide a special link you can follow to finish the account creation process. You will be able to enter your own private password.

## Log in With GitHub

If you have a GitHub account you can use it to log in and create an account.

* First click "Log in".
* Then click the Octocat/GitHub logo.
* If you are signed into GitHub you'll be asked if you want GitHub to login to bugzilla.mozilla.org on your behalf and what information about your account will be shared from GitHub with us.
* If you aren't signed in, GitHub will ask you to login, then if you want to be asked if you want GitHub to be able to login on your behalf.
* You'll be identified by the email address you use on GitHub.

**Note:** If you have previously created a local account as described in the first method above, and then decide to use GitHub to login later, just make sure the email address you have registered in GitHub matches the email address used to create the local account. Otherwise, a separate account will be created which is likely not what you want.

# Searching

*Omg, so many ways to search; why do we have so many, and how do they work?*

## Quick Search

*Quick Search rocks! You should use it.*

## Advanced Search, Pronouns

*Advanced search looks hardcore, but the rewards for learning how to drive it are plentiful. Also, pronouns are amazing.*

## Other Searches (Instant, Simple, Google)

*In case you were looking for more ways to search.*

# Bugmail

*Bugmail* is the common term for automated emails from BMO. The biggest source of bugmail is changes to bugs, but BMO may also email you reports and other notices.

## Filtering

*Too much bugmail? Filter on BMO itself and/or via x-headers!*

### Filtering with GMail

GMail's ability to filter on headers is somewhat limited. We've got a separate, complete [guide](/BMO/UserGuide/Filtering_Bugzilla_Email_in_GMail "BMO/UserGuide/Filtering Bugzilla Email in GMail") on advanced bugmail filtering with GMail.

# Users

Bugzilla isn't as user-centric as many modern web apps, but we've added a few features in the last few years.

## User Profiles

By selecting [My Profile](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile) from the dropdown in BMO's header, you can see a collection of statistics about your interactions with BMO. You can use the Search field at the top to see the profile of any other BMO user. Clicking on a user's name in a bug view also provides a link to that user's profile.

There's a [project page](/BMO/UserProfiles "BMO/UserProfiles") about User Profiles which has brief description of the fields.

## "New to Bugzilla"

A user's comments will be tagged as "New to Bugzilla" under the following conditions:

* The user does *not* have editbugs access.
* The user has made 25 comments or less **OR** the account is less than 60 days old.

The "New to Bugzilla" indicator doesn't mean *this account was created recently*, it's an indicator that *this user hasn't used Bugzilla much, please tailor your responses accordingly*.

This is only displayed to people with canconfirm or editbugs access.

# Understanding, Editing, and Filing Bugs

## Standard Bug Fields

Bugzilla bugs have a lot of fields that allow for classifying types of bugs. This also allows for easy grouping and searching for specific bugs. Most of the standard bug fields are described [here](/BMO/UserGuide/BugFields "BMO/UserGuide/BugFields").

## Comment Tagging

Want to convey some out-of-band information on a comment? Tag it.
Want to auto-collapse a spammy, abusive, or obsolete comment? [Tag it](/BMO/Comment_Tagging "BMO/Comment Tagging").

## Comment Editing

Some users can edit comments made on bugs, if you do so, please follow [our guidelines](/BMO/Editing_Comments "BMO/Editing Comments").

## Keywords and the Whiteboard

*What are all these keywords and weird whiteboard stuff? What is a whiteboard anyhow? Which should i use?*

**Keywords**:
These are a limited set of keyword tags, set by teams and people with admin privilege. You can start typing a tag and get a dropdown menu of all the keywords currently available. Keywords like "regression" and "crash" are used by engineering, release, and QA teams, for example.

**Whiteboard**:
The whiteboard field is for free tagging. It's used both by teams and by people who want to track bugs they're interested in.

## Tracking Status

See [BMO/UserGuide/BugStatuses](/BMO/UserGuide/BugStatuses "BMO/UserGuide/BugStatuses")

## Tracking Flags

[![Flagexample.png](/images/thumb/8/89/Flagexample.png/400px-Flagexample.png)](/File%3AFlagexample.png)
### tracking-firefoxXX

*Who's doing the tracking? Should i even set these flags?*

Tracking flags are used by developers, triagers, QA and the release management teams to keep track of bugs whose fixes are slated to go into a particular product release. A tracking flag shows whether a bug is being investigated for possible resolution in the Firefox XX release. Bugs marked tracking-Firefox XX are bugs that must be resolved one way or another before a particular release ships. [Release drivers](/Firefox/Drivers "Firefox/Drivers") will track and shepherd the bug until it is determined the bug no longer impacts the release.

[![Tracking-flag-example.png](/images/thumb/4/4b/Tracking-flag-example.png/300px-Tracking-flag-example.png)](/File%3ATracking-flag-example.png)

Tracking flags have the values:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| --- | Default/Not nominated |
| ? | Bug is nominated for this release |
| + | Bug is tracked for this release |
| - | Bug will not be tracked for this release |
| blocking | Bug is considered a blocker for this release |

Most users will only be able to [nominate a bug for tracking](/Release_Management/Release_Process#All_about_Flags "Release Management/Release Process") by setting the tracking flag for a release to *?*. The Release Drivers group (which includes Release Management) will respond to the request for tracking.

For example, a [search for tracking Firefox Beta and "+"](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?f1=cf_tracking_firefox_beta&o1=equals&v1=%2B) would list the bugs which release managers decided to track for the Beta release of Firefox.

If you would like to suggest a bug and its fix be considered (by release managers) for a particular release, edit the bug and set the tracking flag for that release to *?*. This is often done for a bug that's been fixed in one release channel but needs to be uplifted to another.

Refer to [these guidelines](http://web.archive.org/web/20160417051846/https%3A//blog.mozilla.org/channels/2011/06/01/more-details-about-how-to-use-the-tracking-firefox-bugzilla-flag/) on setting the tracking flag.

### status-firefoxXX

A flag which represents the status of the bug with respect to Firefox XX.

status-firefoxXX

| --- | We don't know whether Firefox XX is affected |
| --- | --- |
| ? | We don't know whether Firefox XX is affected, but we want to find out |
| unaffected | This bug does not affect Firefox XX |
| affected | This bug affects Firefox XX |
| fix-optional | This bug affects Firefox XX, we would take a fix but don't consider it as release blocking |
| fixed | This bug is fixed in Firefox XX |
| verified | This bug is fixed and verified in Firefox XX |
| disabled | This feature is disabled in Firefox XX |
| verified disabled | Disabling the feature is verified in Firefox XX |
| wontfix | A fix for this bug will not be accepted in Firefox XX |

**Approval Flags**: Set on the attachment of a bug
All patches landing on *mozilla-beta/release/esr* branches must have these nominated by setting a ***?***  flag.
Please make sure to fill in the populated list of questions **[Approval Request Comment]** that come up on the attachment.
This helps Release Management understand the user impact & the risk/reward analysis before we grant or deny approval. If this form is left incomplete it will be sent back to you for completion.

[![ApprovalRequest.png](/images/thumb/e/e7/ApprovalRequest.png/750px-ApprovalRequest.png)](/File%3AApprovalRequest.png)
## Status Flags

Status flags detail, at the release level, if a bug is present or will be addressed in a particular version.

[![Thumb](/images/6/62/Status-flag-example.png)](/File%3AStatus-flag-example.png "Thumb")

## Project Flags

Project flags are used to supplement a bug's prioritization. These flags are defined at the product and component level and will not be present for all bugs. Most often they are used to establish when a bug is to be worked on during a multi-release spanning project.

Example project flags are:

* [a11y-review](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/processes/accessibility-review.html)
* [Webcompat Priority](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/WebCompat_Priority_Flags)
* [Performance Impact](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Bugzilla#Project_Flag)

## Needinfo Flag

In some bug tracking systems, to request information from someone about a bug, the bug is usually assigned to the person asked. In Bugzilla, we use *needinfo* flags.

The *needinfo* flag can be set at or after a bug's creation. When a *needinfo* flag is set, the person asked receives an email directing them to visit the bug, logging in if necessary, and answer the question.

To create a *needinfo*, you can specify the bug's assignee (if any,) the bug's triage owner (if one is defined,) the bug's reporter, or another user. Ask the question in a comment and set the *needinfo* flag before you save the bug.

Common uses of *needinfo* include:

* Asking a bug reporter for more information so that a bug can be triaged
* Asking a subject matter expert for direction or clarification

Please respond to *needinfo* requests quickly to keep others from being blocked.

To clear a needinfo, go to the bug's page, respond to the question and save your comment. By default the *clear this needinfo request* checkbox is ticked.

If you need to route the request to another person, leave the *clear this needinfo request* checkbox ticked, and set a new *needinfo* for the person to which you want to send the question to, then save the bug.

You can see the *needinfo* flags you have requested of others and the ones requested of you in [My Dashboard](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=mydashboard.html).

# Team to components mapping

All Bugzilla components are linked to a team.

The full list of teams is available at <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/config/component_teams>.

The full list of components linked to a specific team is available at <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/config/component_teams/TEAM_NAME> (replace TEAM\_NAME with an actual team name).

Use <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/rest/product?type=accessible&include_fields=name&include_fields=components.name&include_fields=components.team_name> if you want to find out what team is assigned to a specific component.

When creating a new component, make sure to link it to the right team. If you are not sure, use the team the triage owner of the new component belongs to.

## Adding a new team or changing an existing one

File a bug at <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration> asking to change component info.

Make sure :marco is CCed so they can adjust the quality weekly reports. Needinfo :dveditz to adjust the weekly security report

# Other Ways to use BMO and its Data

## Whining

*Bugzilla can automatically send you buglists (requires canconfirm).*

BMO can automatically send you buglists (or a group of people) at defined intervals. This requires that you have specific rights required to [create whines](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/editwhines.cgi).

## APIs

*I hear you want to integrate with BMO. Where to start, what to do next, and best practices which won't get you blocked.*

BMO has a REST API that can perform most common tasks and is great for allowing external systems to integrate with Bugzilla. More details on how to use the API can be found [here](http://bmo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html).

## Dashboards

*Trying to answer the "what should i do today" question? Go no further than the dashboards.*

[My Dashboard](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=mydashboard.html) has some nice options for viewing lists of bugs that may be of interest to you.

# Permissions and Groups

If you would like to be able to change the status of bugs from UNCONFIRMED to NEW, you will need the canconfirm permission. It also allows you to file a bug as NEW rather than as UNCONFIRMED, which is the default for bugs filed by new users to bugzilla.mozilla.org.

The editbugs permission gives you the ability to edit most fields of a bug. It's very useful for adding good information to a bug, and for making summaries more clear and descriptive.

## How to apply for upgraded permissions

If you want **canconfirm**, you can add it yourself using [triage request form](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=triage_request.html).

If you want **editbugs**, [file a new bug, including](https://mzl.la/2izLT4J):

* The URLs of two bugs to which you have attached patches or testcases.
* The URLs of the relevant comment on three bugs which you wanted to change, but couldn't, and so added a comment instead.

**Note:** **editbugs** implies **canconfirm** there's no need to apply for both.

There are many other groups, some team-specific, some for security reasons, and some that are for corporate confidential bugs or comments. By default, everyone is in the BMO group **everyone**. Your permissions affect which shared searches you can see. When you create a saved search of your own, you can choose to share it with any group that are in.

You can see your current [groups and permissions](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=permissions).

# BMO vs Bugzilla

Bugzilla is the name of the popular issue-tracking software application, used by many organizations and maintained by the Bugzilla project. Its home is at <http://www.bugzilla.org>. While the Bugzilla project was started by Mozilla, it is administered separately, having its own Project Lead, Assistant Project Leads, and other roles. Most of the roles are, at current, occupied by Mozilla contributors, but in the past core Bugzilla contributors have not had significant involvement in other Mozilla projects. Mozilla does provide resources, including employee time, to the Bugzilla project. The best description of Mozilla's involvement in Bugzilla is that of a steward.

BMO is an abbreviation of bugzilla.mozilla.org. It is Mozilla's site-specific Bugzilla installation, which is a slight fork of the standard Bugzilla source (or "upstream") with many extensions. At the moment, the fork is technically from Bugzilla 4.2, but many features have been backported from 4.4 and master—in fact, many features in those branches were written by the BMO developers, who added them to upstream but also backported them so they could be immediately available to BMO users. Since we've backported most fixes and features that are of particular use in BMO, we haven't been strict about keeping up with the latest official upstream release. Another difference is that the BMO devs have not prioritized deployability in BMO, since fixes and features are just pushed out each week to the BMO installation, although they have made significant progress in making BMO [more hackable](/BMO/Hacking "BMO/Hacking").

In sum, the main difference between Bugzilla and BMO is that the former is the name of the general-purpose software, and the latter Mozilla's site-specific installation. An analogue is [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) versus [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).
