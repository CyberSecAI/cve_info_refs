Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2009-1709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue that occurs during the garbage collection of JavaScript set elements within the WebCore component of Apple Safari.
- The specific problem arises when an SVG set object is appended to an SVG marker element that is subsequently dereferenced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Use-after-free:** The core vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of memory associated with SVG animation elements. After an object is freed, there is still a reference to it that causes a use-after-free condition.
- **Reference Counting Failure:** When the SVG set object is attached to a marker element which is then dereferenced the marker element is not properly reference counted and later when the set element is appended to another object, the targetElement attribute can access the freed memory

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the current user.
-   **Application Termination:** Exploitation could also lead to an unexpected application crash or termination.
-   **Heap Corruption:** Incorrect access to freed memory results in heap corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Remote Exploitation via Malicious Website:** The primary attack vector involves enticing a user to visit a specially crafted web page containing malicious JavaScript code.
-   **User Interaction Required:** The user must visit the malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote from the victim's system, as the attack is triggered by a malicious website.
-   **Crafted Webpage:** The attacker needs to create a web page that triggers the vulnerability in WebKit's SVG handling.
-   **Social Engineering:** The attacker relies on getting the victim to visit the malicious page.

**Additional Notes:**

- Apple addressed this issue in Safari 4.0 via improved handling of caches.
- The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '6569'.
