The provided content relates to CVE-2009-1404 and describes vulnerabilities found in pastelcms version 0.8.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the Local File Inclusion vulnerability is the insecure handling of the `set_lng` parameter. The SQL injection vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the login process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The `set_lng` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to LFI, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files.
- SQL Injection: The login process in `admin.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **LFI:** Allows an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, potentially gaining access to configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data.
- **SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to bypass the login process and gain administrative access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **LFI:** By manipulating the `set_lng` parameter in the URL, an attacker can include local files.
- **SQL Injection:** By injecting malicious SQL code into the username field during login, an attacker can bypass authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **LFI:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable web application.
- **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to access the login page of the vulnerable web application.
