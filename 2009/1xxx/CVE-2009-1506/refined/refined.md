Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `banner-details.php` script of the eLitius 1.0 application. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `banner-details.php` script, leading to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database.
- The example exploit uses `UNION SELECT` to retrieve database version, username, and the current database name.
- Depending on the database permissions and the application's logic, the attacker might be able to modify or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL with the `id` parameter in the `banner-details.php` script.
- The attacker sends a malicious SQL query through this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The application requires a user to be signed in as a member but default credentials (`username::demo password::demo`) are provided.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` injection with a negative `id` value.
- The attacker injects `UNION SELECT 1,2,3,concat(@@version,0x3a,user(),0x3a,database()),5,6,7,CHAR(83, 110, 97, 107, 101, 115, 84, 101, 97, 77)/*` to extract information such as the database version, user, and database name.
