Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2009-1336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a failure to correctly initialize the NFS filename limit within the `nfs_server` structure in the Linux kernel. This incorrect initialization occurs during the `nfs_probe_fsinfo()` and `nfs_init_server()` functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper filename limit enforcement in the NFS client. This leads to a situation where overly long filenames can be processed, triggering a kernel oops (crash) in the `encode_lookup()` function, which is responsible for handling filename lookups.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS). An attacker can trigger a kernel oops, causing a system crash, making the system unavailable. This could be triggered by a local, unprivileged user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can exploit this flaw by creating or using an NFS client and attempting to access a file with a filename exceeding the improperly initialized limit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to have an account on a client system that mounts an NFS share.
*  The attacker needs the ability to create or manipulate files with long names.
* An attacker does not require root or elevated privileges.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered in the `encode_lookup()` function of the NFS server subsystem.
*   The fix involves limiting the values set in `nfs_probe_fsinfo()` and `nfs_init_server()`, as well as ensuring that `readdirplus` and `nfs4_path_walk` respect file name limits.
*   The vulnerability affects both NFSv3 and NFSv4 clients, and potentially NFS servers (although the content focused on client-side issues).
