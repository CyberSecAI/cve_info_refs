Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1908:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue present in the SKIP software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS), specifically CWE-79. This means the application is not properly sanitizing user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Defacing the website.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the injection of malicious scripts into the vulnerable application's input fields or URLs.
- The attacker would typically craft a malicious URL or inject script through a form, which when rendered by a victim's browser, will execute the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious script into the application's input.
- The attacker can be remote (i.e., they do not require local access to the server).
- The attacker can be unauthenticated, as this is an XSS vulnerability. The JVN report mentions that self-registration may be required.
- Some level of user interaction is required, such as clicking on a malicious link.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** SKIP ver.1.0.2 and earlier, and SKIP ver.1.1RC2 and earlier.
