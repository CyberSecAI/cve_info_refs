How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**oCERT-2009-010 mimeTeX and mathTeX buffer overflows and command injection**

**Description**:

The [mimeTeX](http://www.forkosh.com/mimetex.html) and [mathTeX](http://www.forkosh.com/mathtex.html)
CGIs are widely used helper executables that allow mathematical equation
rendering in the form of images. Both applications suffer from several buffer
overflows as well as command injection which result in remote code
execution.

The mimeTeX application suffers from several stack-based buffer
overflows which can be remotely triggered by passing oversized TeX expressions.
Additionally the \environ, \input and \counter directives may not be
suitable for exposure to commands from the Internet.

Similarly the mathTeX application does not perform sufficient input
sanitization and allows untrusted input, passed via HTTP query strings, to be
used as command arguments allowing command injection. Additionally it suffers
from several stack-based overflows as well as insecure temporary file
handling.

**Affected version**:

Unfortunately mimeTeX and mathTex are provided without version numbers
by the maintainer, who releases version-less zip archives. It is therefore
impossible to provide affected version numbers.

**Fixed version**:

At the release time for this advisory both versions available on the
maintainer website fix the overflow and injection issues.

[mimeTeX](http://www.forkosh.com/mimetex.html), mimetex.zip (2009/07/13)

[mathTeX](http://www.forkosh.com/mathtex.html), mathtex.zip (2009/07/13)

**Credit**: vulnerability report received from Chris Evans <cevans
[at] google [dot] com> (mimetex) and Damien Miller <djm [at] google [dot]

Subject: [oCERT] mimetex and mathtex security vulnerabilities

Hi John,

oCERT received two vulnerability reports about mathex and mimetex. We can put
you in contact with reporters and provide you with more detail if needed.

We would like to know if you are willing to provide patches and coordinate
with us an advisory release as well as pre-notification to vendors and
possibly US-CERT considering the large amount of website which uses your
cgis.

IMPORTANT: Please let us know if you have any questions/concerns, we would
ask you not to disclose any of this information publicly until we have
confirmed an embargo date for these issues. (please let me know if you are
not familiar with this practice).

I'm ccing the reporters for further discussion.

Thanks a lot!

Report 1:

There appears to rampant strcpy() use, many usages of which seem vulnerable.
A simple example TeX expression that triggers one and therefore crashes, is:

\picture(12,34){(AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA$10,10){testing}}

The code flaw seems to be in rastpicture():

char pream[64];
...
 strcpy(pream,putexpr); } /\* copy leading preamble from put \*/

No bounds checking. Perhaps a wholesale conversion of strcpy() -> strncpy()
(remembering it does not null terminate) is in order?

Poking around on Google image search, some significant web sites would seem
to embed a copy of mimetex.cgi and therefore are at risk:
<http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=inurl%3Abin%2Fmimetex&btnG=Search+Images&gbv=2>
...
<http://physics.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi?f(x)=>
\int\_{-\infty}^xe^{-t^2}dt
<https://richarddawkins.net/cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi>?\int\_{10}^{13} x dx
<http://www.sciforums.com/cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi>?\int \limits\_a^b 4x^2~dx
<http://bioeng.washington.edu/cgi-bin/mimetex.cgi>? \huge r2\_o = r\_{io} +
h\_o

Report 2:

In MathTeX picking one of the several arguments that is supplied to
subprocesses:

920 if ( getdirective(expression,"\\density",1,1,density) /\*look for
\density\*/
 921 == NULL ) /\* no \density directive \*/
 922 getdirective(expression,"\\dpi",1,1,density); /\* so try \dpi
instead \*/
...
 1081 char convertargs[1024] = /\* args/switches for convert
\*/
 1082 " -density %%dpi%% -gamma %%gamma%%"
 1083 /\*" -border 0% -fuzz 2%"\*/
 1084 " -trim -transparent \"#FFFFFF\" ";
...
 1266 /\* --- replace %%dpi%% in convert arg template with actual density
--- \*/
 1267 strreplace(convertargs,"%%dpi%%",density,1,0);
...
 1277 strcat(command,convertargs); /\* add convert switches \*/
...
 1284 sys\_stat = system(command); /\* execute system(convert)
command \*/

The getdirective() function extracts a directive from the HTTP query string,
taking untrusted input with no filtering.

There are also stack-based overflows caused by operations on convertargs,
command and pretty much every other string.

Finally, and I haven't bothered to confirm this given the above, it looks
like its temp file handling is insecure too: it uses deterministic paths and
does not open with O\_CREAT|O\_EXCL (in fact, it just uses fopen).

someone in a cert team somewhere, presumably.

their business is finding vulnerabilities in software, that could
cause vulnerabilities if installed on a web server. unchecked
strcopy, iirc, was the ultimate source of the morris worm so it's the
sort of thing these people look for.

it's irrelevant whether it's difficult to "trip over the problem";
what's relevant is whether it's possible to use the problem to
construct an attack on the server that offers the program.

(we get personal service from our local cert team, because we know all
of the members well; if we get messages from any other -- even if it's
from the isp's team -- they tend to be pretty impersonal. if you run
a service of any sort, you're likely to attract messages from cert
teams all over the place. we do.)

Thanks, Robin. I agree that can be a useful community service,
and maybe I overreacted a little. But I get emails from people
with requests or pointing out errors all the time, none of whom
have felt the need to use words like "embargo" until now.

Anyway, I've looked over the remaining 91 occurrences of strcpy
in mimetex.c, which are all pretty benign, comprising statements
like
 strcpy(subexpr,"{"); /\* start off with opening { \*/
or like
 strcpy(expression,delim+1); /\* shift name= out of expression \*/
where delim is already a pointer into expression. Nevertheless,
although mimetex.c isn't large, with 15K lines of code you're almost
guaranteed that some errors remain somewheres.

As for mathtex.c, I've fixed the explicit vulnerability that was
pointed out. But anyone using it should realize it's essentially
a script written in C that just runs latex and friends. So it's
going to remain as exploitable as all the similar script cgi's
that are out there. I'm not sure there's much I can do about that.

So far (knock on wood), however, I haven't received any emails
from people who think their systems have been hacked into
through either mimetex or mathtex. Though more people use these
programs than I'd have originally guessed, it's still a vanishingly
small user base in web terms. And I'd guess that seriously
dangerous hackers/crackers might focus their efforts on jucier
targets.

cert teams embargo details of problems that have been reported to them
so that the supplier of the software has time to put it right.

why do you think m$ releases can be so precisely scheduled? -- because
the cert people have embargoed their information. once the patches
have propagated, cert will release the information.

any website that's capable of doing anything other than just serving
pages is a worthy target of attack by the slime who do these things.
(and sometimes they even have an agenda related to nothing more than
the pages that are served.)

Oops, looks like I misinterpreted their meaning. But it wasn't
too far-fetched a misinterpretation given their choice of vocabulary
and grammar (especially on the internet, routinely peppered with more
gratuitous obnoxiousness than one might hope for).

Okay, well, I've put current corrected copies of mimetex.zip and
mathtex.zip on [ftp.tex.ac.uk/incoming](http://ftp.tex.ac.uk/incoming), along with the requisite
emails to [ctan.dante.de](http://ctan.dante.de). Sorry for the extra work. (P.S. You're
welcome for the upload.:) And, to the extent that security remains
an ongoing issue, perhaps users of either program should be advised
that, while I am an experienced C programmer, I'm no security expert.
 And that leads to the open question of how much of one's time
should be spent trying to do good things, versus trying to stop
other people from doing bad things. (I'm not liking today's answer
to that question, which perhaps partly explains my initial bad
reaction to ocert's email.)

It is really a matter of \*whose\* time is spent. If no security measures
are taken someone else will -- inevitably -- have to clean up the mess
when some script kiddie had fun. No, I don't like it either, but then I
would also like to live in a world where I did not need to lock my car
either.
