Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-1383:

**CVE-2009-1383:**

*   **Vulnerable Software:** mathTeX CGI
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization in the mathTeX application allows untrusted input, passed via HTTP query strings, to be used as command arguments, leading to command injection. Additionally, there are multiple stack-based buffer overflows and insecure temporary file handling.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**:
    *   **Command Injection**:  The `getdirective()` function extracts directives from the HTTP query string without proper filtering, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the arguments of system calls.
    *   **Stack-based Buffer Overflows**: Multiple stack-based buffer overflows exist due to insufficient bounds checking when handling strings like `convertargs` and `command`.
    *   **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The application uses deterministic paths for temporary files and does not open them with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL`, leading to potential race conditions and unauthorized access.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Remote Code Execution**: By exploiting command injection vulnerabilities, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable application, potentially leading to a full compromise of the server.
    *   **Denial of Service**: Buffer overflows can cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Data Breaches**: Depending on the permissions of the exploited process and the commands used, sensitive data could be accessed and exfiltrated.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **HTTP Query Strings**: Attackers can inject malicious code and commands via specially crafted HTTP query strings targeting the vulnerable `getdirective()` function.
    *   **Oversized TeX Expressions**: Attackers can trigger stack-based overflows by providing oversized TeX expressions via HTTP parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server hosting the mathTeX CGI application.
    *   No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory notes that both mimeTeX (CVE-2009-1382) and mathTeX lacked version numbers, which made precise vulnerability identification harder initially.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported by the Google Security Team.
*   The issues were initially reported on May 22nd, 2009, and patched versions were available as of July 13, 2009, although initial fixes were found to be incomplete.
*   The author of mathTeX expresses concern about the attitude of the security researchers, but ultimately acknowledges the validity and severity of the vulnerabilities and releases patched versions.
