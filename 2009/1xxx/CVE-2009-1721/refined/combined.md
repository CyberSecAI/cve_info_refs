# USN-831-1: OpenEXR vulnerabilities

14 September 2009

OpenEXR vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 9.04](/security/notices?release=jaunty)
* [Ubuntu 8.10](/security/notices?release=intrepid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [openexr](/security/cves?package=openexr) -

## Details

Drew Yao discovered several flaws in the way OpenEXR handled certain

malformed EXR image files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted

EXR image file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application

crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1720](/security/CVE-2009-1720), [CVE-2009-1721](/security/CVE-2009-1721))

It was discovered that OpenEXR did not properly handle certain malformed

EXR image files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted EXR image

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or

possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2009-1722](/security/CVE-2009-1722))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 9.04

* [libopenexr6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openexr)
  -
  [1.6.1-3ubuntu1.9.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openexr/1.6.1-3ubuntu1.9.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.10

* [libopenexr6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openexr)
  -
  [1.6.1-3ubuntu1.8.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openexr/1.6.1-3ubuntu1.8.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [libopenexr2ldbl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openexr)
  -
  [1.2.2-4.4ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/openexr/1.2.2-4.4ubuntu1.1)

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1842-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff
July 28, 2009                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : openexr
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2009-1720 CVE-2009-1721 CVE-2009-1722

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the OpenEXR image
library, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-1720

   Drew Yao discovered integer overflows in the preview and
   compression code.

CVE-2009-1721

   Drew Yao discovered that an uninitialised pointer could be freed
   in the decompression code.

CVE-2009-1722

   A buffer overflow was discovered in the compression code.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.2-4.3+etch2.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.6.1-3+lenny3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- dnsmasq
New packages fix a buffer overflow and a NULL dereference in the TFTP
server code of dnsmasq.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

#### Security Update 2009-003 / Mac OS X v10.5.8

* **bzip2**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2008-1372

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.7

  Impact: Decompressing maliciously crafted data may lead to an unexpected application termination

  Description: An out-of-bounds memory access exists in bzip2. Opening a maliciously crafted compressed file may lead to an unexpected application termination. This update addresses the issue by updating bzip2 to version 1.0.5. Further information is available via the bzip2 web site at <http://bzip.org/>

* **CFNetwork**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1723

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.7

  Impact: A maliciously crafted website may control the displayed website URL in a certificate warning

  Description: When Safari reaches a website via a 302 redirection and a certificate warning is displayed, the warning will contain the original website URL instead of the current website URL. This may allow a maliciously crafted website that is reached via an open redirector on a user-trusted website to control the displayed website URL in a certificate warning. This issue was addressed by returning the correct URL in the underlying CFNetwork layer. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit to Kevin Day of Your.Org, and Jason Mueller of Indiana University for reporting this issue.

* **ColorSync**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1726

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.4.11, Mac OS X Server v10.4.11, Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.7

  Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted image with an embedded ColorSync profile may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow exists in the handling of images with an embedded ColorSync profile. Opening a maliciously crafted image with an embedded ColorSync profile may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue by performing additional validation of ColorSync profiles. Credit to Chris Evans of the Google Security Team for reporting this issue.

* **CoreTypes**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1727

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.7

  Impact: Users are not warned before opening certain potentially unsafe content types

  Description: This update extends the system's list of content types that will be flagged as potentially unsafe under certain circumstances, such as when they are downloaded from a web page. While these content types are not automatically launched, if manually opened they could lead to the execution of a malicious JavaScript payload. This update improves the system's ability to notify users before handling content types used by Safari. Credit to Brian Mastenbrook, and Clint Ruoho of Laconic Security for reporting this issue.

* **Dock**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0151

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.7

  Impact: A person with physical access to a locked system may use four-finger Multi-Touch gestures

  Description: The screen saver does not block four-finger Multi-Touch gestures, which may allow a person with physical access to a locked system to manage applications or use Expose. This update addresses the issue by properly blocking Multi-Touch gestures when the screen saver is running. This issue only affects systems with a Multi-Touch trackpad.

* **Image RAW**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1728

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5 through v10.5.7, Mac OS X Server v10.5 through v10.5.7

  Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted Canon RAW image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A stack buffer overflow exists in the handling of Canon RAW images. Viewing a maliciously crafted Canon RAW image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. This update addresses the issue through improved bounds checking. For Mac OS X v10.4 systems, this issue is already addressed with Digital Camera RAW Compatibility Update 2.6. Credit to Chris Ries of Carnegie Mellon University Computing Services for reporting this issue.

* **ImageIO**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-1722
