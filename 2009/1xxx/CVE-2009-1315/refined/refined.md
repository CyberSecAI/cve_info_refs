This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions on their behalf.\n*   **Attack Vectors:** A user posting a blog containing malicious script.\n*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create blogs on the platform.\n\n**Linked Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**\n\n*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of user-controlled parameters in `groups_profile.php` (`gid`) and `adv_cat.php` (`cat_id`, `razd_id`).\n*   **Vulnerabilities:** Reflected XSS.\n*  **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a user visits a crafted URL. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other actions on their behalf.\n*   **Attack Vectors:**  HTTP GET requests with crafted parameters in  `groups_profile.php` and `adv_cat.php`.\n*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests and manipulate URL parameters.",
