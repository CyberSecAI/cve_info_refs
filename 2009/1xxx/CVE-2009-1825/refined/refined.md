{
  "CVE-2009-1825": {
    "Root cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper input sanitization.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
	  "Authentication Bypass",
	  "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive information from the database, and perform cross-site scripting attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": {
      "SQL Injection": "By manipulating the 'Name' and 'password' parameters during login, or the 'ID' parameter in various modules.",
      "Authentication Bypass": "Using a crafted 'Name' parameter such as `' or 1=1#` during login.",
      "XSS": "By injecting malicious scripts into the 'month', 'year', 'Page', 'Kontext', or 'image' parameters of various modules."
    },
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. For the SQL injection, a registered user is required to exploit some of the injection points, but the authentication bypass requires no user registration. For XSS, the attacker needs the ability to inject malicious scripts through URL parameters."
