Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1464:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) flaw in the `index.aas` script of the Application Access Server (A-A-S). The `job` parameter in the URL is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **XSRF:** The primary vulnerability is XSRF, where an attacker can force a logged-in user's browser to make requests to the A-A-S server without the user's knowledge or consent.
    *   **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  Through the manipulated `job` parameter, attackers can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The `job`, `action`, and `select` parameters lack proper input validation allowing the injection of malicious commands.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can gain complete control over the system running the vulnerable A-A-S server.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute any OS command, install malware, or steal sensitive data.
    *   **Service Manipulation:** Attackers can stop services, kill processes, and manipulate the system's state.
    *   **Data exfiltration:** Attackers can upload malicious files to the server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript in a web page. When a logged-in A-A-S user visits this page, the JavaScript will automatically send requests to the A-A-S server, triggering the vulnerability.
    *   **Directly crafted URL:** Attackers can directly craft URLs to execute commands if the user has the application open.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Knowledge of Target A-A-S Instance:** The attacker needs to know the A-A-S server's IP or DynDNS address and port.
    *   **User Logged In:** The targeted user needs to be logged into the A-A-S web interface for the XSRF attack to be successful.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes example code that demonstrates how an attacker can chain together commands to download and execute a file on the victim's machine through the vulnerable application.
*   The advisory also notes that security features like the host access list and port modes of the A-A-S server will not protect against the XSRF vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects A-A-S version 2.0.48 and possibly earlier versions.
*   The vendor was notified and has provided workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability until a patch is released, such as disabling specific rights for users and avoiding browsing to other websites while logged into the application.

**Summary of CVE-2009-1464:**

The vulnerability is a critical XSRF flaw that allows for arbitrary command execution on vulnerable Application Access Server instances. An attacker could potentially gain complete control of affected systems. The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking an authenticated user into visiting a malicious website or by directly crafting malicious URL requests, making it very dangerous.
