        "rootCause": "The application has multiple vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices.",

        "attackVectors": [
          "HTTP GET requests with manipulated parameters in login forms and various modules.",
             "Manipulation of the 'Name' and 'password' parameters during the login process.",

        "attackerCapabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable application and should have knowledge of SQL injection and XSS techniques. For authentication bypass, magic quotes must be off. For SQL injection, the attacker needs a registered user account. For XSS, an attacker can inject JavaScript almost anywhere with user-controlled parameters."
