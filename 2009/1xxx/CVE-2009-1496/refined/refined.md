Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Joomla! component `com_cmimarketplace` is vulnerable to directory traversal. The `viewit` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to navigate the file system.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially accessing sensitive information like configuration files, source code, or database credentials.
*   **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable component, specifically through the `viewit` parameter in the URL.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! installation. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Technical Details**: The vulnerable component is `com_cmimarketplace`, and the vulnerable parameter is `viewit`. The exploit example provided is `/index.php?option=com_cmimarketplace&Itemid=70&viewit=/../../&cid=1`. This shows that by providing directory traversal sequences such as `/../` as a value to the parameter, an attacker can access directories outside of the intended path.
