Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2009-1244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A critical vulnerability exists in the virtual machine display function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Host code execution vulnerability from a guest operating system. This allows a guest OS to execute code on the host system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A guest operating system can run arbitrary code on the host system. This can lead to complete compromise of the host system.
- The vulnerability allows privilege escalation from the guest to the host.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through the virtual machine display functionality when a guest operating system interacts with the host's display capabilities.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious guest operating system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over a guest operating system running on a vulnerable VMware product.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute code within the guest OS.
- No user interaction on the host is required beyond starting a virtual machine running a malicious guest.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- VMware Workstation 6.5.1 and earlier
- VMware Player 2.5.1 and earlier
- VMware ACE 2.5.1 and earlier
- VMware Server 2.0
- VMware Server 1.0.8 and earlier
- VMware Fusion 2.0.3 and earlier
- VMware ESXi 3.5 without patch ESXe350-200904201-O-SG
- VMware ESX 3.5 without patch ESX350-200904201-SG
- VMware ESX 3.0.3 without patch ESX303-200904403-SG
- VMware ESX 3.0.2 without patch ESX-1008421

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to the patched versions or apply the patches provided by VMware.
- Gentoo recommends unmerging the vulnerable packages, as support has been discontinued.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2008-4916, which concerns a guest virtual device driver vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is considered "CRITICAL" in severity.
