Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2009-1317:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection present in two files of Aqua CMS: `/droplets/functions/base.php` and `/admin/index.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsanitized Input:** The code directly incorporates user-controlled data (from cookies and POST requests) into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.
    *   Specifically, the `userSID` cookie in `base.php` and the `username` and `password` POST parameters in `admin/index.php` are used in SQL queries.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The code uses `mysql_query` directly, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Magic Quotes Dependency:** The exploitability is dependent on `magic_quotes_gpc` being turned off. This implies the application relies on this setting instead of implementing its own sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** Attackers can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other data stored in the application. This is demonstrated by the provided proof-of-concept (PoC) that shows how to extract user credentials.
*  **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the login authentication by injecting SQL code into the `username` field, allowing them to log in as an administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The `userSID` cookie is used in the `base.php` file, so manipulating this cookie can lead to SQL injection.
*   **HTTP POST Request Manipulation:** The `username` and `password` parameters in a POST request to `/admin/index.php` can be manipulated to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to send cookies and POST requests.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL injection techniques to construct malicious queries.

**Additional Notes**
*   The exploit requires `magic_quotes_gpc` to be off. This setting is deprecated and removed from PHP 7.4.0, so the vulnerability is no longer as easily exploitable on modern PHP versions.
*   The provided exploit examples use MySQL specific syntax.
