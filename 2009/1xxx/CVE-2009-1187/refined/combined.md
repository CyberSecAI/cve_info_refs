How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

It seems that poppler-bindings virtual/poppler, virtual/poppler-utils all need to bump to -0.10.5, otherwise portage insists on downgrading poppler to -0.10.4 (things like cups want virtual/poppler-utils or virtual/poppler, and the versions of those are tied to the underlying poppler version.

## Xpdf and poppler contain multiple vulnerabilities in the processing of JBIG2 data

#### Vulnerability Note VU#196617

Original Release Date: 2009-04-16 | Last Revised: 2012-03-28

---

### Overview

Xpdf and poppler contain multiple vulnerabilities, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| [Xpdf](http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/) is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files. Several PDF viewing applications and libraries, such as poppler, are based on the Xpdf code. Xpdf contains multiple vulnerabilities related to the handling of PDF files that contain JBIG2 data. The vulnerabilities include, but are not limited to, a buffer overflow, an integer overflow, a null pointer dereference, and an infinite loop. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to open a malicious PDF file, an attacker may be able to execute code or cause a vulnerable PDF viewer to crash. The PDF could be emailed as an attachment or hosted on a website. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  These issues are addressed in Xpdf 3.02-pl3 and [poppler 0.10.6](http://poppler.freedesktop.org/poppler-0.10.6.tar.gz). Please check with your vendor for software updates. |
