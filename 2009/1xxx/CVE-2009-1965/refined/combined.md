### Overview

Oracle products and components are affected by multiple vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of service.

The [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2009](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpuoct2009.html) addresses 16 vulnerabilities in various Oracle products and components. The document provides information about affected components, access and authorization required for successful exploitation, and the impact from the vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Oracle has associated CVE identifiers with the vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update. If significant additional details about vulnerabilities and remediation techniques become available, we will update the [Vulnerability Notes Database](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/).

### Impact

The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product, component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database may be able to access sensitive information.

### Solution

Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the [Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2009](http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/cpuoct2009.html). Note that this document only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for previously known issues are not listed.
