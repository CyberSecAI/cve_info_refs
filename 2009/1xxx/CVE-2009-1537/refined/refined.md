{
  "related": true,
  "information": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists due to improper parsing of QuickTime media files by Microsoft DirectShow component, specifically related to NULL byte handling, pointer validation and size validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper parsing of QuickTime media files",
       "Lack of proper validation of pointer values",
      "Lack of proper validation of size fields within QuickTime media files"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain the same user rights as the local user, potentially leading to complete control of an affected system, enabling the installation of programs, data manipulation, and creation of new accounts with full user rights.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted QuickTime media file",
      "Receiving specially crafted streaming content from a website",
      "Receiving a file with embedded malicious QuickTime content via email." ,
       "Placing a malicious QuickTime file in a folder or network share, where hovering the mouse over the file can trigger the vulnerability."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious QuickTime media file. They also need to convince a user to open it (e.g., via social engineering or by hosting the file on a malicious website). Successful exploitation can be achieved by simply convincing a user to hover their mouse over the file."
