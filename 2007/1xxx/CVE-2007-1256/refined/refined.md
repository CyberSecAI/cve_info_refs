Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in how Firefox handles `onunload` events in conjunction with `document.location` and `document.write`. Specifically, when a page attempts to navigate away using a link, the `onunload` event handler redirects the user back to the same page before the new page fully loads. This creates a context where the browser is in a state of flux and handles subsequent requests, like "View Source", using the context of the new page, but not displaying the page content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Source Display:** The primary vulnerability is that when a user attempts to view the source code of a page manipulated by this technique, they are shown the source code of the target page from the link clicked, rather than the source of the current page (the one they are seeing).
*   **Page Spoofing:** The browser's URL bar and favicon may display the correct information for the page the user *intended* to navigate to, while the content displayed (or lack thereof) is still tied to the original page. This effectively spoofs the source of the new page.
*   **Potential for Malicious Content:** While the provided examples do not demonstrate an exploit, it is indicated that a malicious attacker could use this to conceal malicious code, by having the URL and favicon display one thing while the page source and page rendering is different and potentially hidden.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Source Code Concealment:** Attackers can hide malicious JavaScript or other content from users who attempt to view the page source. This makes it harder to identify malicious activity within a web page.
*   **User Confusion:** The discrepancy between the displayed URL, favicon, and the actual page source, and content can confuse the user and lead them to believe they are on a legitimate site.
*   **Potential for phishing/malware delivery:** A user may be tricked into believing they are on a different webpage than they actually are, potentially inputting sensitive data or downloading malicious payloads.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves using JavaScript code within a web page, using an `onunload` event handler to force a page redirect to itself. This can be triggered by:
    *   Clicking a link on the page.
    *   Submitting a form.
    *   Using javascript to navigate away from the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a web page and control the content, particularly the javascript.
*   The attacker requires the victim to open the manipulated page in a vulnerable browser.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content mentions that this vulnerability was reported to Bugzilla, but closed as a duplicate of a much older bug (253497), indicating a long-standing flaw in the browser.
*   The provided content references Firefox version 2.0.0.2. The exploit was tested on Firefox 2.0.0.1 where it caused crashes, but on 2.0.0.2, the code runs, but an exploit could not be produced.
*   The analysis demonstrates that the issue is more than just a crash.  It is a flaw that could be exploited to create a page that seems to be another website with a different source.
