How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

===============
1) Introduction
===============
Conquest is a multi-player game which can be defined the predecessor of
Netrek (http://www.netrek.org).
Note that on some distros (like Debian) the conquest's binaries are
marked setgid for the conquest group.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
-----------------------------------------
A] buffer-overflow in metaGetServerList()
-----------------------------------------
The Conquest client has an option (-m) for the querying of the
metaserver conquest.radscan.com on which are listed the servers
currently online but the program allows the usage of alternative
metaservers too.
The function which reads the data received from the metaserver is
affected by a stack based buffer-overflow which happens during the
storing of the line containing the server's entry in a buffer (buf) of
1024 bytes.
The best exploitation of this bug is for local users who want to
escalate their privileges gaining the conquest group.
At the same time exists also another buffer-overflow which affects the
static servers buffer limited to 1000 (META\_MAXSERVERS) max servers,
anyway doesn't seem possible to fully exploit this second bug for code
execution.
from meta.c:
int metaGetServerList(char \*remotehost, metaSRec\_t \*\*srvlist)
{
static metaSRec\_t servers[META\_MAXSERVERS];
...
char buf[1024]; /\* server buffer \*/
...
off = 0;
while (read(s, &c, 1) > 0)
{
if (c != '\n')
{
buf[off++] = c;
}
else
{ /\* we got one \*/
buf[off] = 0;
/\* convert to a metaSRec\_t \*/
if (str2srec(&servers[nums], buf))
nums++;
...
------------------------------------------
B] memory corruption through SP\_CLIENTSTAT
------------------------------------------
SP\_CLIENTSTAT is a type of packet used by the server for sending some
informations about the ships and the users.
In this packet are located two numbers which are not correctly
sanitized by the client:
- unum: 16 bit, used for the Users structure
- snum: 8 bit, used for the Ships structure
Both the structures are placed in the cBasePtr buffer allocated at
runtime with 262144 (SIZEOF\_COMMONBLOCK) bytes of memory: Users at
offset 388 where each element has a size of 264 bytes (total 132000)
and Ships at offset 141040 with 1124 bytes per element (total 23604).
In both the cases is possible to write one or more bytes in some zones
of the memory outside the original structures and the cBasePtr buffer,
but I think that code execution is practically impossible...
The following are the instructions used for handling the SP\_CLIENTSTAT
packet and where is easily visible the writing of the scstat->team
value sent by the server:
case SP\_CLIENTSTAT:
scstat = (spClientStat\_t \*)buf;
Context.snum = scstat->snum;
Context.unum = (int)ntohs(scstat->unum);
Ships[Context.snum].team = scstat->team;
clientFlags = scstat->flags;
break;
#######################################################################
===========
3) The Code
===========
A]
- launch a fake metaserver which sends more than 1024 chars:
perl -e 'print "a"x1200' | nc -l -p 1700 -v -v -n
- launch the client specifying the alternate metaserver:
conquest -m -M 127.0.0.1
- interrupt the fake metaserver, conquest should have been crashed
trying to executing the code at offset 0x61616161
B]
- get the source code of the server, modify the scstat.snum or
scstat.unum value in the sendClientStat function located in server.c
giving them values like 0xff (for snum) or htons(0xffff) (for unum)
depending by what of the two bugs you want to test:
scstat.type = SP\_CLIENTSTAT;
scstat.flags = flags;
- scstat.snum = snum;
+ scstat.snum = 0xff;
scstat.team = team;
scstat.unum = htons(unum);
scstat.esystem = esystem;
- compile the new server, launch it and join with a client which will
crash after the login

# conquest

Conquest is a top-down, real time space warfare game. It was
originally written in RATFOR for the VAX/VMS system in 1983 by Jef
Poskanzer and Craig Leres.

I spent incredible amounts of time playing this game with my friends
in the terminal labs at college, and when I actually had a multi-user
system running at home (Unixware) I decided to try and translate/port
the code to C in Unix. This was in the early to mid 1990's.

Of course, over the years many things have changed. Today, Conquest is
a true client/server game. The client uses freeglut, SDL 2.0 (for
sound) and OpenGL. It uses C++11 to build, though for now it's "C
software with some C++ containers and constructs".

The curses client is no longer provided.

## License

Conquest is released under the [MIT License](/jontrulson/conquest/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

## Playing the game

Conquest is a client that must connect over a network to a conquestd
server. By default, if all requirements are met, both the client and
server will be built. To start the client and connect to a server,
run:

`conquest`

By default, when running conquest without options, conquest will query
the meta-server at *conquest.radscan.com* to get a list of currently
available servers. Pick one, login, and play.

Alternatively, you can specify a specific server with the "-s" option:

`conquest -s localhost:1701`

The port number is optional, and will default to 1701.

You can get a list of the currently active servers via your web browser
by going to <https://radscan.com/cgi-bin/conqmeta.pl>

### The goal of the game

The goal of the game is to conquer the Universe by bombing planets,
placing your team's armies on them and fighting off any ships that
want to ruin your day. When all of the core planets have been taken
by your team, the game is reset to start the carnage all over again.

## Build Requirements

To build and run Conquest, you will need:

* automake/autoconf/libtool - The whole autoconf system.
* X11 development headers and libraries (all of them)
* OpenGL development headers and libraries. Conquest uses OpenGL
  version 1.x.
* glut/freeglut development headers and libraries
* SDL 2.0 and SDL\_mixer 2.0, if you want sound (you do).
* g++ 4.9 or better, or clang++ 3.4 or better

Conquest supports Linux systems and has also been tested on MAC OSX
with homebrew. I currently develop on Kubuntu 22.04.

In the past, other Unix systems were supported like the BSD's
(FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc) as will as Digital Unix for Alpha processors,
and Sun/Oracle Solaris.

These have not been tested in a while, so if there are problems,
please feel free to send patches. If they still work, I'd love to
know.

The last release of conquest in 2010 also supported the conquest
client (only) on MS Windows systems (XP and Windows 7) using MinGW.
This has also not been tested in a while, but I plan to support this
again later.

### Ubuntu

On an Ubuntu system (tested with Kubuntu 18.04), the following
should install the required packages to build the server and client:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libtool \
     libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev ncurses-dev bison flex \
     freeglut3-dev libxi-dev libxmu-dev

```

### MacOS (Sonoma)

conquest can be built on MacOS (only Sonoma was tried) using
homebrew. It will run under XQuartz, so have that installed.

```
brew install autoconf automake sdl2 sdl2_mixer pkg-config

```

### Add the *conquest* group

Conquest requires it's own group to prevent cheating or interference
with the game data.

#### Linux/Unix

First, create the conquest group (unix):

`sudo groupadd conquest`

#### MacOS

On MacOS, you must create the group using *Apple Menu->Users and
Groups*. Add the *conquest* group. Afterward, click on the Info (i)
icon for the group and add yourself to it.

### Building Conquest

Then:

```
sh ./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install

```

## Mailing List

There is a low volume mailing list for Conquest. You can subscribe
[here](https://radscan.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/conquest).

## IRC Channel

There is an IRC channel for Conquest on irc.libera.chat, channel: *#conquest*

## Further information

* The [Conquest Guide](/jontrulson/conquest/blob/master/docs/conquest-guide.md). This document gives
  you some more information on Conquest and explains how to play it
  (bomb planets, fight robot ships, etc). It also provides
  information on navigation and other things you might want to know.
* A Conquest player put up this
  [Strategy Guide](https://cataboligne.org/index.php?itemid=17) some
  years ago. While a little dated, it still has some good
  information for new players.
* The [HISTORY](/jontrulson/conquest/blob/master/docs/HISTORY.txt) file. This document gives
  an overview of changes between releases.
* The [Server Guide](/jontrulson/conquest/blob/master/docs/server-guide.md) has instructions for those
  wanting to run their own Conquest servers.
* Marisa Giancarla has setup a Conquest
  [Gameplayers Club Community Page](https://conquest.gameplayer.club/)
  for players and operators who wish to participate. Also available
  are tools to help potential server operators who are not familiar
  with the Linux/Unix command line.
* The [CQI Parser Documentation](/jontrulson/conquest/blob/master/docs/conqinit.txt) provides
  information on the format and types of files the Conquest server and
  client uses to configure itself. The Universe (planets, etc),
  textures, animations, and sound information are all handled by this
  parser. This is primarily of interest to those wanting to run a
  server with a modified Universe.

NOTE: Some of these were taken using the server recordings of actual
game play.
