Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2007-1371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability lies in the `metaGetServerList()` function of the Conquest client. This function reads data from a metaserver and stores the server's entry line in a fixed-size buffer. It doesn't check the length of the incoming data, leading to a buffer overflow if the server sends more data than the buffer can hold.
*   **Memory Corruption:** A secondary issue exists in the handling of `SP_CLIENTSTAT` packets sent by the server. The client doesn't properly sanitize the `unum` and `snum` fields in this packet. These fields are used as indexes to write into structures in memory, which can cause memory corruption if the provided values are out-of-bounds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A classic stack-based buffer overflow in the client's network handling logic.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Insufficient input validation when parsing data from both metaservers and game servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Exploiting the buffer overflow can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the client machine. This could lead to complete compromise of the client machine, allowing the attacker to steal data, install malware, or other malicious actions.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit the overflow to gain privileges of the "conquest" group which binaries are setgid for.
*   **Memory Corruption and Denial of Service:** The memory corruption vulnerabilities can lead to client crashes or unpredictable behavior, potentially causing denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Metaserver:** An attacker can set up a malicious metaserver that sends overly long server entries to trigger the buffer overflow in the client when the client queries the server list.
*   **Compromised Game Server:** A compromised game server can send crafted `SP_CLIENTSTAT` packets with out-of-bound `unum` and/or `snum` values to trigger the memory corruption vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Metaserver or Compromise Game Server:** An attacker needs to be able to operate a metaserver or game server to send malicious data.
*   **Local User (for privilege escalation):** A local user with access to the system can leverage the setgid configuration of the game for privilege escalation.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker must have network connectivity to the victim machine.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Luigi Auriemma.
*   The vulnerable versions are Conquest client versions <= 8.2a (svn 691).
*   The fix was implemented in SVN revision 693.
*   The `metaGetServerList()` function uses a fixed 1024-byte buffer.
*  The `cBasePtr` buffer is allocated with 262144 bytes of memory.
*  The `Users` struct is placed at offset 388 where each element has a size of 264 bytes for a total of 132000.
*  The `Ships` struct is placed at offset 141040 with 1124 bytes per element for a total of 23604.
*   The exploitability subscore of 3.4/10 suggests that it's not the easiest to exploit.
