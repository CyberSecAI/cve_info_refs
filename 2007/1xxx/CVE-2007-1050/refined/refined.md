Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1050:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the `index.php` file of AbleDesign MyCalendar. This allows malicious script injection through various parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Specifically, the following are vulnerable:
    *   `go` parameter in the URL
    *   `keyword` parameter when `go=search`
    *   `username` field during login
    *   `password` field during login

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary web scripts in the context of the user's browser.
    *   Potentially steal cookies, hijack user sessions, or deface the website.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vectors are the vulnerable parameters within the application, specifically:
    *   Crafting a malicious URL with script in the `go` parameter.
    *   Injecting script into the `keyword` parameter during a search.
    *   Injecting script into the `username` or `password` fields on the login page.
    *   These can all be delivered via crafted links or man-in-the-middle attacks

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, without needing any privileged access or direct interaction with the server.
*   **Medium attack complexity** The attacker needs to craft malicious links.
*  **No Authentication** No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in AbleDesign MyCalendar.
*   The vendor website is `http://abledesign.com/programs/MyCalendar/`
*   The vulnerability was reported by "sn0oPy."
*   Exploit examples include injecting JavaScript into the URL, search parameters, username and password fields.
