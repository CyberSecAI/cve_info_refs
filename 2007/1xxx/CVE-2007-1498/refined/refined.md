Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-1498:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the `SiteManager.dll` ActiveX control used by McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator and ProtectionPilot.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The `ExportSiteList`, and `VerifyPackageCatalog` functions within `SiteManager.dll` are vulnerable to buffer overflows when provided with excessively long string parameters. The `wcscpy` and `swprintf` functions are used to copy data into fixed-size buffers on the stack without proper bounds checking, leading to overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious content.
*   **Denial of Service:** The overflow can also cause Internet Explorer or other programs using the WebBrowser control to crash, leading to denial of service.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers can gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through specially crafted HTML documents.
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to convince a user to view the malicious HTML content (e.g., a web page, HTML email, or attachment).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and does not require prior authentication.
*   **Malicious HTML Content:** The attacker needs to create malicious HTML content that triggers the overflow when processed by a vulnerable system.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker needs a way to lure a user into opening the malicious content (e.g. through phishing or malicious websites).

**Additional Details:**

*   The `SiteManager.dll` ActiveX control is used by the management consoles of McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator and ProtectionPilot.
*   The vulnerabilities exist in the `ExportSiteList()`, and `VerifyPackageCatalog()` functions.
*   The issue arises from the use of functions like `wcscpy` and `swprintf` without proper bounds checking, leading to a copy of long strings to stack buffers.
*   The vulnerability is rated high risk, with a CVSS base score of 9.3/10.

**Affected Software Versions:**

*   McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 3.6.1
*   McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 3.5 patch 6

**Mitigation:**
*   McAfee released patches to address this issue.
*   Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) prevents the exploitation of the vulnerability.
