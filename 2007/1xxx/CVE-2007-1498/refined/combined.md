How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

hi full-disclosure,
McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator Multiple Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities
by cocoruder of FSRT(Fortinet Security Research Team)
hfli\_at\_fortinet.com
Summary:
Multiple remote buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the ActiveX Control named "SiteManager.Dll" of McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator. A remote attacker who successfully exploit these vulnerabilities can completely take control of the affected system.
Affected Software Versions:
McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 3.6.1
McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator 3.5 patch 6
Details:
1.Function "ExportSiteList()" educed by "SiteManager.dll" stack overflow.
InprocServer32: SiteManager.dll
ClassID : 4124FDF6-B540-44C5-96B4-A380CEE9826A
ProgID : SiteManager.SiteMgr.1
Function Name : ExportSiteList
When we set the parameter of "ExportSiteList" a long string, there will cause a stack base overflow. The following is the related code:
(SiteManager.dll,version=3.6.1.166)
.text:5262B1DE ; func\_ExportSiteList
.text:5262B1DE ; Attributes: bp-based frame
.text:5262B1DE
.text:5262B1DE ; int \_\_stdcall sub\_5262B1DE(int,wchar\_t \*,int)
.text:5262B1DE sub\_5262B1DE proc near ; DATA XREF: .rdata:5265B504o
.text:5262B1DE ; .rdata:5265B614o
.text:5262B1DE
.text:5262B1DE var\_414 = word ptr -414h
.text:5262B1DE var\_20E = word ptr -20Eh
.text:5262B1DE var\_20C = word ptr -20Ch
.text:5262B1DE var\_4 = dword ptr -4
.text:5262B1DE arg\_0 = dword ptr 8
.text:5262B1DE arg\_4 = dword ptr 0Ch
.text:5262B1DE arg\_8 = dword ptr 10h
.text:5262B1DE
.text:5262B1DE push ebp
.text:5262B1DF mov ebp, esp
.text:5262B1E1 sub esp, 414h
.text:5262B1E7 mov eax, dword\_52670218 ; set stack cookie
.text:5262B1EC push esi
.text:5262B1ED push [ebp+arg\_4] ; lpSrcBuff
.text:5262B1F0 mov [ebp+var\_4], eax
.text:5262B1F3 lea eax, [ebp+var\_20C]
.text:5262B1F9 push eax ; lpDestBuff
.text:5262B1FA call ds:wcscpy ; stack overflow
2.Moreover, we think that the following "swprintf" function also has carried out the copy action without attestation, as follows:
.text:5262B257 push ebx
.text:5262B258 push edi
.text:5262B259 mov edi, offset aSitelist\_xml ; "SiteList.xml"
.text:5262B25E push edi
.text:5262B25F lea eax, [ebp+var\_20C]
.text:5262B265 push eax
.text:5262B266 lea eax, [ebp+var\_414]
.text:5262B26C push offset aSS\_0 ; "%s\%s"
.text:5262B271 push eax ; lpSrcBuff
.text:5262B272 call ds:swprintf ; stack overflow
3.Function "VerifyPackageCatalog()" educed by "SiteManager.dll" stack overflow.
InprocServer32: SiteManager.dll
ClassID : 4124FDF6-B540-44C5-96B4-A380CEE9826A
ProgID : SiteManager.SiteMgr.1
Function Name : VerifyPackageCatalog
When we set the parameter of "VerifyPackageCatalog" a long string, there will cause a stack base overflow. The following is the related code:
(SiteManager.dll,version=3.6.1.166)
part1:
.text:5262CFAC func\_VerifyPackageCatalog proc near
.text:5262CFAC
.text:5262CFAC mov eax, offset loc\_52649F86
.text:5262CFB1 call \_\_EH\_prolog
...
.text:5262D00C lea eax, [ebp-28h]
.text:5262D00F push eax
.text:5262D010 push ebx
.text:5262D011 push esi
.text:5262D012 push offset loc\_5263AD1A
.text:5262D017 push ebx
.text:5262D018 push ebx
.text:5262D019 call ds:\_beginthreadex
part2:
.text:5263AD1A mov eax, offset loc\_5264B221
.text:5263AD1F call \_\_EH\_prolog
.text:52637229 push ecx
.text:5263722A mov eax, 1774h
.text:5263722F call \_\_alloca\_probe ; int
.text:52637234 mov eax, dword\_52670218
.text:52637239 mov [ebp-14h], eax ; set stack-cookie
...
.text:5263AD9A lea ecx, [ebp-23Ch]
.text:5263ADA0 push ecx
.text:5263ADA1 push eax
.text:5263ADA2 mov ecx, edi
.text:5263ADA4 call sub\_5263721F

## McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator and ProtectionPilot ActiveX control buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#714593

Original Release Date: 2007-03-22 | Last Revised: 2007-03-22

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in an ActiveX control provided with the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator and ProtectionPilot software could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.

### Description

| The McAfee [ePolicy Orchestrator](http://www.mcafee.com/us/enterprise/products/system_security_management/epolicy_orchestrator.html) and [ProtectionPilot](http://www.mcafee.com/us/smb/products/management_solutions/protection_pilot.html) are applications that are designed to allow centralized security management of multiple clients. Remote management of the ePolicy Orchestrator and ProtectionPilot servers are done through a management console.  The ActiveX control SiteManager.Dll that is shipped with the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator and ProtectionPilot contains two functions that are vulnerable to stack based buffer overflows.Note that SiteManager.Dll should only be installed on systems that have used the McAfee management console. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause Internet Explorer (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**McAfee has released an upgrade to address this issue. See the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) and ProtectionPilot (PRP) HotFixes fix multiple vulnerabilities [security bulletin](https://knowledge.mcafee.com/article/26/612496_f.SAL_Public.html) for details about obtaining updated software. |
| --- |

| **Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the "[Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer)" document. |

### [McAfee](#RGII-6ZHNCE) Affected

Updated:  March 22, 2007

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

On March 13, McAfee published a vulnerability announcement to its online knowledgebase and pro-actively contacted customers through various means to alert them of security patches posted which fix these non-critical security flaws. The security flaws in McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator and McAfee ProtectionPilot SiteManager.dll are only found on machines that have the management console installed on it and are only exploitable with the assistance of the end user. Very few machines in an organization should have this console installed on it, and it is not installed with any of McAfee's other products or the ePolicy Orchestrator and ProtectionPilot agent.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

See <https://knowledge.mcafee.com/article/26/612496_f.SAL_Public.html> for more details.
