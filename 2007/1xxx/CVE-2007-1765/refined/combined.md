 While there are many obvious threats like hacktivists, nation-state adversaries and ransomware operators, there also lies a constant ever-growing undercurrent that we call nuisance traffic.

It only materializes to the average user when its abrasive behavior erodes at our security, affecting our productivity and our ability to communicate through the connected world.

 Anonymous Sudan is a highly prolific threat actor conducting distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) to support their pro-Russian, anti-Western agenda. Although the attacks attributed to this adversary are of political and (ostensibly) religious motivation, this group also performs acts of retaliation against messaging platforms that restrict their communications.

The Power of Names
https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/the-power-of-names
 Typically, application-layer protocols such as HTTP/s, QUIC, SIP, and others receive the lion’s share of attention in most discussions of internet traffic. But it’s the Domain Name System (DNS), the control plane of the internet — that glue that holds it together and facilitates global end-to-end communications — that is often overlooked. And yet, without the functionality it provides, the network of networks which comprise the global internet would cease to function.

 The phrase Bulletproof hosting suggests technical sophistication, infrastructure resiliency, and a platform with elaborate redundancy.

 Adversaries weaponize STUN servers by incorporating the protocol into DDoS-for-Hire services. Approximately 75k abusable STUN servers give DDoS attackers ample opportunity to launch single-vector STUN attacks as large as 441 Gbps, or use the protocol in multi-vector attacks of a significantly greater size. Learn how to mitigate attacks leveraging STUN in our analysis.

Datagram Transport Layer Security (D/TLS) Reflection/Amplification DDoS Attack Mitigation Recommendations
https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/datagram-transport-layer-security-dtls-reflectionamplification
 Datagram Transport Layer Security (D/TLS) is a variant of the TLS encryption protocol implemented atop User Datagram Protocol (UDP), it is utilized to secure datagram-based applications to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. As a result of some misconfigured D/TLS implementations attackers can abuse the protocol to launch D/TLS reflection/amplification DDoS attacks.
