| [Description](#c0)  Vic Fryzel (shellsage) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-12-31 01:41:53 UTC  ``` lsat insecurely writes to files in /tmp, without first checking to see if those files could be symlinks, possibly allowing for the overwriting of arbitrary files upon installing lsat.  Additionally, Gentoo patches lsat before building it to again be insecure by pointing to the same file(s) in /tmp before checking to see if the file is a symlink.  Generally this file is /tmp/lsat1.lsat . ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Vic Fryzel (shellsage) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-12-31 01:43:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 105029](attachment.cgi?id=105029 "grep for insecure /tmp usage in lsat.")

There is no symlink attack vulnerability (at least in that respect) there.   As for the file opening on an existing file (symlink attack), please see this section, which will clarify the flags I have set in open so that particular situation does not occour.  <http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/open.html>  I ask that this bug be moved to INVALID.   Thank you.  ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-09 20:55:14 UTC  ``` Indeed i am unable to find any insecure open() calls.  - Several race conditions are possible between a successfull open(O_EXCL) and a following fopen() call. See for example checkfiles.c around line 87, the fopen(...,a) could lead to a symlink attack if an attacker manage to create the symlink between open(O_EXCL) and fopen(...,a).  - The informative examples provided in README.modules and modules.html are clearly unsecure since the O_EXCL flag is missing.   ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  number9    2007-04-10 02:55:28 UTC  ``` "Several race conditions are possible between a successfull open(O_EXCL) and a following fopen() call. See for example checkfiles.c around line 87, the fopen(...,a) could lead to a symlink attack if an attacker manage to create the symlink between open(O_EXCL) and fopen(...,a)."  Is this really a serious circumstance? I suppose I could write a script that would look for when lsat was running and then time my execution such that in between those two calls I would create a link from that file to my target, but I get the feeling an attacker clever enough to work out the timing envolved would already have control of the system through other means.   "The informative examples provided in README.modules and modules.html are clearly unsecure since the O_EXCL flag is missing."  Thanks for catching that. I started out without then realized a symlink attack was possible, updated the modules but forgot to update the readmes. I have added them in and will update the tarballs.   Again, and I am being serious, is a symlink attack in between those calls in the same module a serious issue? I am not one to blow off security, but I will have to think harder about this "insecurity" in the code.   ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Matt Drew (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-10 13:17:51 UTC  ``` The open() calls look ok to me as well, except for things like:  outfile=fopen(filename, "a");  in checkftpusers.c and checkrc.c.  Just because it's a user-specified file doesn't mean it doesn't need to be protected against symlink attacks - what if the user chose /tmp/outfile?  Regardless, it would probably be safer use your own directory in /tmp or put the temp files in some place only writable by the user running lsat, and keep all the safeguards in place just in case.  This stuff is ugly and still shows up on a regular basis ten years it was documented - there's no sense in putting files where one mistake could cause a compromise.  ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Matt Drew (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-10 13:35:51 UTC  ``` Ignore my last comment - I see the protection now (when opening out_file in lsatmain.c). ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  number9    2007-04-10 18:45:38 UTC  ``` I am open for comments on the condition example given in checkfiles.c in or around line 87. I see the possibility in theory, but I have a bit of a time seeing it as a normal user on the system. I note the following article, on the right hand column of page 6, where they speak of this  exact race, but have a hard time coming up with a solution.  <http://www.stanford.edu/~talg/papers/traps/traps-ndss03.pdf> My next question, which I will be STFW for shortly, is how does everyone else cope with this insecurity? I would like to resolve this problem  quickly but with precision. I am working now, but doing this on my breaks, so I may be slow, but I will keep on this. Any hints or pointers is much appreciated.     ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Vic Fryzel (shellsage) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-10 22:06:09 UTC  ``` ""Several race conditions are possible between a successfull open(O_EXCL) and a following fopen() call. See for example checkfiles.c around line 87, the fopen(...,a) could lead to a symlink attack if an attacker manage to create the symlink between open(O_EXCL) and fopen(...,a)."  Is this really a serious circumstance?"  Yes, it's a simple bash script to exploit that sort of race condition.  As a normal user I'd just write simple while loop that ran in wait.  It'd be barely detectable and once the conditions were met, take arbitrary actions on the system. ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  number9    2007-04-15 13:38:56 UTC  ``` This guide gives a few examples of secure writing to temp files, but I note that even here, I could cause a race condition (with say the GNOME example)... even creating a random filename in the do loop is not enough. Even if you could prove that the  do loop is the critical section, I could be running that instance of linux/LSAT in a VM and I could timeslice the critical section.  So I ask... does the gentoo security community have a solution to writing temp files? It seems that nothing I read is actually secure since I can always catch the name of the file and cause a race or perform a symlink attack.   <http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO.html#TEMPORARY-FILES>   ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  number9    2007-04-27 23:26:58 UTC  ``` New version released. I have taken care of the open problem. The file is only opened once, and then the file descirptor is turned into a pointer instead of opening the file again.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# LSAT: Insecure temporary file creation — GLSA **200703-20**

LSAT insecurely creates temporary files which can lead to symlink attacks
allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/lsat** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.9.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.9.5** |

### Background

The Linux Security Auditing Tool (LSAT) is a post install security
auditor which checks many system configurations and local network
settings on the system for common security or configuration errors and
for packages that are not needed.

### Description

LSAT insecurely writes in /tmp with a predictable filename.

### Impact

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
the LSAT script is executed, this would result in the file being
overwritten with the rights of the user running the software, which
could be the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All lsat users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/lsat-0.9.5"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Vic Fryzel (shellsage) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-12-31 01:41:53 UTC  ``` lsat insecurely writes to files in /tmp, without first checking to see if those files could be symlinks, possibly allowing for the overwriting of arbitrary files upon installing lsat.  Additionally, Gentoo patches lsat before building it to again be insecure by pointing to the same file(s) in /tmp before checking to see if the file is a symlink.  Generally this file is /tmp/lsat1.lsat . ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Vic Fryzel (shellsage) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2006-12-31 01:43:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 105029](attachment.cgi?id=105029 "grep for insecure /tmp usage in lsat.")

There is no symlink attack vulnerability (at least in that respect) there.   As for the file opening on an existing file (symlink attack), please see this section, which will clarify the flags I have set in open so that particular situation does not occour.  <http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/open.html>  I ask that this bug be moved to INVALID.   Thank you.  ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-09 20:55:14 UTC  ``` Indeed i am unable to find any insecure open() calls.  - Several race conditions are possible between a successfull open(O_EXCL) and a following fopen() call. See for example checkfiles.c around line 87, the fopen(...,a) could lead to a symlink attack if an attacker manage to create the symlink between open(O_EXCL) and fopen(...,a).  - The informative examples provided in README.modules and modules.html are clearly unsecure since the O_EXCL flag is missing.   ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  number9    2007-04-10 02:55:28 UTC  ``` "Several race conditions are possible between a successfull open(O_EXCL) and a following fopen() call. See for example checkfiles.c around line 87, the fopen(...,a) could lead to a symlink attack if an attacker manage to create the symlink between open(O_EXCL) and fopen(...,a)."  Is this really a serious circumstance? I suppose I could write a script that would look for when lsat was running and then time my execution such that in between those two calls I would create a link from that file to my target, but I get the feeling an attacker clever enough to work out the timing envolved would already have control of the system through other means.   "The informative examples provided in README.modules and modules.html are clearly unsecure since the O_EXCL flag is missing."  Thanks for catching that. I started out without then realized a symlink attack was possible, updated the modules but forgot to update the readmes. I have added them in and will update the tarballs.   Again, and I am being serious, is a symlink attack in between those calls in the same module a serious issue? I am not one to blow off security, but I will have to think harder about this "insecurity" in the code.   ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Matt Drew (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-10 13:17:51 UTC  ``` The open() calls look ok to me as well, except for things like:  outfile=fopen(filename, "a");  in checkftpusers.c and checkrc.c.  Just because it's a user-specified file doesn't mean it doesn't need to be protected against symlink attacks - what if the user chose /tmp/outfile?  Regardless, it would probably be safer use your own directory in /tmp or put the temp files in some place only writable by the user running lsat, and keep all the safeguards in place just in case.  This stuff is ugly and still shows up on a regular basis ten years it was documented - there's no sense in putting files where one mistake could cause a compromise.  ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Matt Drew (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-10 13:35:51 UTC  ``` Ignore my last comment - I see the protection now (when opening out_file in lsatmain.c). ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  number9    2007-04-10 18:45:38 UTC  ``` I am open for comments on the condition example given in checkfiles.c in or around line 87. I see the possibility in theory, but I have a bit of a time seeing it as a normal user on the system. I note the following article, on the right hand column of page 6, where they speak of this  exact race, but have a hard time coming up with a solution.  <http://www.stanford.edu/~talg/papers/traps/traps-ndss03.pdf> My next question, which I will be STFW for shortly, is how does everyone else cope with this insecurity? I would like to resolve this problem  quickly but with precision. I am working now, but doing this on my breaks, so I may be slow, but I will keep on this. Any hints or pointers is much appreciated.     ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Vic Fryzel (shellsage) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-10 22:06:09 UTC  ``` ""Several race conditions are possible between a successfull open(O_EXCL) and a following fopen() call. See for example checkfiles.c around line 87, the fopen(...,a) could lead to a symlink attack if an attacker manage to create the symlink between open(O_EXCL) and fopen(...,a)."  Is this really a serious circumstance?"  Yes, it's a simple bash script to exploit that sort of race condition.  As a normal user I'd just write simple while loop that ran in wait.  It'd be barely detectable and once the conditions were met, take arbitrary actions on the system. ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  number9    2007-04-15 13:38:56 UTC  ``` This guide gives a few examples of secure writing to temp files, but I note that even here, I could cause a race condition (with say the GNOME example)... even creating a random filename in the do loop is not enough. Even if you could prove that the  do loop is the critical section, I could be running that instance of linux/LSAT in a VM and I could timeslice the critical section.  So I ask... does the gentoo security community have a solution to writing temp files? It seems that nothing I read is actually secure since I can always catch the name of the file and cause a race or perform a symlink attack.   <http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO.html#TEMPORARY-FILES>   ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  number9    2007-04-27 23:26:58 UTC  ``` New version released.
