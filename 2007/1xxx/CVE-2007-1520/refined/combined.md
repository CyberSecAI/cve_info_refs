How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### [Php Nuke wild POST XSS](/2007/03/09/php-nuke-wild-post-xss/)

March 9, 2007 at 12:47 am - Filed under [Hacks](/category/hacks/), [Language EN](/category/language-en/) - 1530 words, reading time ~5 minutes - [Permalink](/2007/03/09/php-nuke-wild-post-xss/) - [Comments](http://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=http://www.ush.it/2007/03/09/php-nuke-wild-post-xss/&t=Php%20Nuke%20wild%20POST%20XSS)

To demonstrate the import\_request\_variables() bug i've exploited a XSS flaw in PHP NUKE 8.0 that has an anti-CSRF routine. The import\_request\_variables() vulnerability will permit you to exploit a wide range of vectors (XSS, remote file inclusion, remote code execution, SQL injections, etc.) on software that makes use of it.

```

Php Nuke POST XSS on steroids

 Name              Php Nuke POST XSS on steroids
 Systems Affected  PHP >=4.0.7 <=5.2.1, GLOBALS OFF, Php Nuke 8.0 and
                   others (partially verified)
 Severity          Medium
 Vendor            http://php nuke.org/
 Advisory          http://www_ush_it/2007/03/09/php-nuke-wild-post-xss/
 Authors           Francesco `ascii` Ongaro (ascii@ush.it)
                   Stefano `wisec` di Paola (stefano.dipaola@wisec.it)
 Date              20070307

I. BACKGROUND

Php Nuke is a CMS written in PHP. This advisory is just an example on
how to exploit an XSS on platforms that use anti CSRF techniques with
the import_request_variables() bypass.

II. DESCRIPTION

An XSS vulnerability exists in the handling of the query post variable
in the Search function of the Downloads module. This is exploitable in
special conditions; you need:

 - PHP >=4.0.7 <=5.2.1 to use the import_request_variables() trick
 - register_globals off (doesn\'t work with globals on)
 - Php Nuke 8 and others

III. ANALYSIS

Php Nuke 8.0 is vulnerable to an XSS on _POST, you can verify this using
the provided testsuite.

www.phpnuke.org [67.15.16.43] 80 (http) open
<form
action=\"modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=search&query=token<>toke

Infact the injection is in the form action:

<form
action=\"modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=search&query=token<>token\"
method=\"post\">

When you will try to apply CSRF to this bug (eg. you need a gateway page
to send the post query) you\'ll notice that Php Nuke has a generic piece
of code in mainfile.php that prevents posting with a \"wrong\" referrer.

Test this with the following two testsuites:

In the first case the attack will succeed cause the referrer matches, in
the second the anti-off-domain-post-check will block your attempt and
you\'ll get a message like: Posting from another server not allowed!

It seems that other versions have this check too.

The initial part of mainfile.php can be synthesized as following:

--- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- ------------ --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8

// get php version
$phpver = phpversion();

// convert superglobals if php is lower then 4.1.0
if ($phpver < \'4.1.0\') {
 [..cut..]
}

// override old superglobals if php is higher then 4.1.0
if($phpver >= \'4.1.0\') {
 [..cut..]
}

if (!ini_get(\'register_globals\')) {
 @import_request_variables(\"GPC\", \"\");
}

[..]

// Posting from other servers in not allowed
if ($_SERVER[\'REQUEST_METHOD\'] == \"POST\") {
 if (isset($_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\'])) {
  if (!stripos_clone($_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\'], $_SERVER[\'HTTP_HOST\']))
   die(\'Posting from another server not allowed!\');
 } else die($posttags);
}

--- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- ------------ --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8

So if globals are off using the import_request_variables() trick we can
overwrite the _SERVER array and bypass the check (yes, you can do a lot
of other things too, this is just an example).

Use this code to replicate the issue:

--- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- poc.sh --- >8 --- >8 --- >8 --- >8

#!/bin/bash
cat > testsuite.php << TOKEN
<?php
echo \'GLOBALS \'.(int)ini_get(\"register_globals\").\"\\\\n\";
if (!ini_get(\'register_globals\')) import_request_variables(\'GPC\');
// Posting from other servers in not allowed
if (\\$_SERVER[\'REQUEST_METHOD\'] == \"POST\") {
 if (isset(\\$_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\'])) {
  if (!stripos(\\$_SERVER[\'HTTP_REFERER\'], \\$_SERVER[\'HTTP_HOST\']))
   die(\'Posting from another server not allowed!\');
 } else die(\'No referer!\');
}

echo \'IM THE PAGE!\'.\"\\n\";

?>
TOKEN

Doesn\'t this seems cyclic to you? stripos will return TRUE if the
array element doesn\'t exists.
