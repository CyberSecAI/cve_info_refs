{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `categos.php` file within the XOOPS Module RM+Soft Gallery.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Blind SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (passwords).",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker sends crafted HTTP GET requests to the `categos.php` file, manipulating the `idcat` parameter to inject SQL code.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. The provided exploit script shows how to automate the blind SQL injection process by sending multiple requests and analyzing the responses. The attacker needs to know or guess the path to the vulnerable script."
