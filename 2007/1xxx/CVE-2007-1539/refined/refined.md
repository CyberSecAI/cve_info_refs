          "root_cause": "The application uses a require_once statement to include a configuration file based on user-supplied input ($module_name) without proper sanitization, leading to Local File Inclusion.",

            "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",

          "impact": "Allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files on the server, which can lead to sensitive information disclosure or arbitrary code execution if combined with other vulnerabilities (like log injection).",
          "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the module_name parameter in the request to map.func.php, an attacker can include files outside the intended modules directory.",
           "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, with the ability to control parameters in the URL."
