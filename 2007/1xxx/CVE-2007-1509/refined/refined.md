{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The enkrypt.php script in Rot 13 does not properly sanitize user-supplied input through the 'datei' parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Disclosure",
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information, such as system files (e.g., /etc/passwd).",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the enkrypt.php script with a 'datei' parameter that contains path traversal sequences (e.g., ../../).",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and requires no authentication."
  },
  "additional_information": {
     "exploit": "The provided exploit example demonstrates how to use the 'datei' parameter to access the /etc/passwd file: wWw.S!Te.cOm/[path]/enkrypt.php?datei=../../../../etc/passwd"
