Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1392:

**CVE-2007-1392** is a vulnerability found in netForo! 0.1, a web application.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `down.php` script, which uses `readfile($_GET['file_to_download']);`. This directly includes a file path taken from user input without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Disclosure (RFD):** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can specify arbitrary file paths through the `file_to_download` GET parameter.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user input, which allows for directory traversal using `../` sequences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read any file on the server that the webserver user has access to. This can include sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`, application configuration files, or database credentials.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** In certain scenarios, where more system files are read, and where write access is possible, an attacker can potentially take over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a URL with the `file_to_download` parameter pointing to the desired file.
    *   Example: `[Path_netForo]/down.php?file_to_download=../../../../etc/passwd`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   The attacker does not require any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

* The exploit-db entry confirms that the vulnerability exists in `netForo 0.1g` and is exploitable via the `file_to_download` parameter.
* The code snippet `readfile($_GET['file_to_download']);` is provided which highlights the vulnerability.
