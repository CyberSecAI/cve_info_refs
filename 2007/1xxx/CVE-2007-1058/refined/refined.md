Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-1058

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. Specifically, the 'art_id' parameter within the 'page.asp' script is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other potentially confidential information.
*   **Data Modification:** In some scenarios, an attacker could modify or delete data within the database if the database user context has write privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By accessing user credentials, an attacker could potentially gain higher privileges within the application or the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script 'page.asp'.
*   **Manipulated Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is 'art_id' in the URL. The attacker injects SQL code within this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the name of the vulnerable parameter ('art_id' in this case) and the structure of the query to properly perform SQL injection.
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** Ability to write SQL queries to extract data.

**Exploit Details:**
The exploit involves injecting a crafted SQL query into the 'art_id' parameter:
*   `page.asp?art_id=-1+union+select+0,Name,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9+from+Users+where+id=1`  (To retrieve username)
*   `page.asp?art_id=-1+union+select+0,PassWord,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9+from+Users+where+id=1` (To retrieve password)

The injected SQL query uses `UNION SELECT` to extract the username and password from the 'Users' table. The `-1` is added to bypass the original query and make the UNION work.
