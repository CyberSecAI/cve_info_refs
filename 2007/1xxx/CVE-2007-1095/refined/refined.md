Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-1095:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the `onUnload` event handler in Mozilla products (like Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird, and XULRunner)  accessed the address of the next page to be loaded, even when navigation was triggered externally (e.g., using bookmarks, back button, or typing in the location bar).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The `onUnload` handler had access to the URL of the new page being loaded, potentially revealing sensitive information present in the URL (e.g., passwords or session IDs in the URL parameters).
- Spoofing/Phishing: Malicious pages could redirect users to phishing sites by using `onUnload` handlers, potentially manipulating the URL bar to display a different address than the actual destination.
- Unsafe JavaScript execution: The combination of `onUnload` and other JavaScript actions like `document.write()` and manipulation of the location DOM hierarchy can allow malicious scripts to potentially take over browser functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure of the next page URL
- Redirection to malicious websites that spoof the intended destination
- Execution of arbitrary javascript leading to other potential attacks
- Privilege escalation on some systems by polluting XPCNativeWrappers
- Read arbitrary local files if Gnome-VFS is present and smb:// or sftp:// URI schemes are available

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious web pages with crafted `onUnload` handlers
- Phishing links that exploit the redirection vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a malicious web page or inject malicious code into a web page.
- Ability to trick users into loading the malicious web page either via a link or by other means.
- An understanding of JavaScript and its use with unload events

**Technical Details:**
- The core issue involves the `onUnload` event handler having access to the new page's address.
- Some implementations of the vulnerability also show the user a corrupted page rather than the intended page.
- The exploit involves javascript document.write() to inject the redirection, and manipulate the location dom hierarchy to hide the maliciousness

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability was discovered by Michal Zalewski and reported to Mozilla.
- The issue affects multiple Mozilla products.
- The vulnerability is rated as "low severity" because, while it can be used for phishing and information theft, it does not immediately give arbitrary code execution.
- Fixes for this CVE also addressed other vulnerabilities in the browser, such as issues related to digest authentication, file upload controls, XUL markup, and URI handling.
- The vulnerability may not be directly reproducible on current browser versions that contain mitigations.

The information provided also mentions that some specific browser settings, like setting `network.http.sendRefererHeader` to `0` can prevent the exploitation of the URL disclosure aspect.
