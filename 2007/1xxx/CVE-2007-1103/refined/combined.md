You're right about the ISPs. Again, I just skimmed the article and I
saw a lot of stuff that didn't look like plain English so I assumed it
was math. It's true a smaller ISP might not control both but when you
look as these huge communication companies like ATT it seems a little
more possible. If I'm not mistaken, ATT owns more than just a /16
subnet.

That's true and perhaps tor should have a country hopping system. If
we only allowed one-per-country-per-circuit then tor would defend
against everything except ECHELON and governments posing as
corporations/individuals running tor circuits.
