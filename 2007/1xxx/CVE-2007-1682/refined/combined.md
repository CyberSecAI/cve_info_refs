| |  | | | **XFile Version Differences** | | --- | |  | | **Differences Between V2.5.2 and V2.5.3** | | **Issues resolved:**  * ActiveX upgrades from older versions of XFile to versions 2.5.1 or 2.5.2 did not complete properly due to the addition of the non-administrative installation option  + The distributed XFile cab now only provides an administrative installation option. There is a separate per-user cab available by special request. | | **Differences Between V2.5.1 and V2.5.2** | | **New Features:**  * In Windows Vista and above clients with Internet Explorer 7 and above, implemented the ability to save files to any accessible directory while Internet Explorer is running in protected mode.  **Issues resolved:**  * Sending a regular GET request that doesn’t involve file download caused Internet Explorer to crash. * During downloads, turning on debug logging in the XFRequest object caused the “Unknown Error Occurred” error. In version 2.5.1, the same bug caused Internet Explorer to crash. * FileManager: FileManager’s "TextStream" object couldn’t properly read ANSI encoded text content and rendered it as question mark characters. | | **Differences Between V2.5.0 and V2.5.1** | | **New Features:**   * Fully supports **non-administrative** ActiveX installation in *Internet Explorer 8* on platforms running *Windows Vista and later* (for reference see MSDN article: [Non-Admin ActiveX Controls](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd433049%28VS.85%29.aspx)) * Significantly improved performance of XFile ASP.NET samples using custom HTML client-side progress indicator | | **Differences Between V2.4.2 and V2.5.0** | | **New Features:**   * New method AddEncryptedRequestHttpHeader in XFileEE's XFRequest object to be used with FileUpEE's new Encryption class (see KB article: [Session loss in ASP.NET 2.0 using XFileEE with FileUpEE](http://support.softartisans.com/kbview.aspx?ID=1320))   **Issues resolved:**   * Addressed the possible exposures to the security vulnerabilities in ATL described in [Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms09-035.mspx) * In downloads with "UseWinInet" property set to false, the temp file for the last downloaded file was not getting deleted after the download is complete * In requests with chunked transfer-encoding turned on or "UseWinInet" property set to false, adding a cookie created a separate Cookie header * "Response" property returned duplicated server response after uploads over 2 GB, or with "TransferEncoding" property set to 1 or "UseWinInet" property set to false * FileManager's "FileExists" method did not recognize files with certain unicode characters in their name * FileManager's "GetFile" method threw error "The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect" for files with unicode characters in their name | | **Differences Between V2.4.1 and V2.4.2** | | **Issue resolved:**   * Downloads over SSL failed when UseWinInet disabled * Visual Progress Indicator showed incorrect Estimated Time and Bytes Transferred * Extra temp file created in USERPROFILE location on client machine during downloads | | **Differences Between V2.4.0 and V2.4.1** | | **Issue resolved:**   * XFile version 2.4.0 did not send the custom X-Content-Length header   required by FileUpEE for chunked uploads * Browser crashed when accessing certain parts of the XFResume object * Downloads over 4 GB with the visual control terminated before completion | | **Differences Between V2.3.4 and V2.4.0** | | **Issue resolved:**   * Security fixes for buffer overflow vulnerabilities * Error: "Could not create RequestRecord" with resumable uploads   and downloads * IE crashed when calling AddFormElement * Visual control and client-side progress indicator displayed incorrect   size for files over 2 GB * Browser crashes during downloads * "Error: Source=null Description=null" masked true error * Large chunked 3-tier uploads failed * FileManager: Attributes property of File object was not working correctly * Filemanager: DeleteFolder method could not delete sub-folder | | **Differences Between V2.2.3 and V2.3.4** | |  | | **New Features:**  * Resumable uploads can now be done asynchronously. Previously, the   Start method had an asynchronous option, but the Resume method did not\** TopFolder property now creates directory structure for storing resume     info if the directories do not exist\** XFResume.IsOpen method was added to determine if the object is already       open to a location\*  \*Available only in XFile Enterprise Edition | | **Issue Resolved:**  * Errors downloading files with long URL using the visual download control* Because of 2 GB limit in ASP.NET's maxRequestLength setting, XFile's     threshold was lowered from 4 GB to 2 GB for automatically switching     uploads to chunked transfer encoding and the custom HTTP client. (equivalent     of setting oXFRequest.TransferEncoding = 1 and oXFRequest.UseWininet     = false)* Certain cases were causing an "Operation timed out" even though no       timeout occurred* TransferStatusChanged event did not return TransferCancelled status         when user aborted the transfer* TransferStatusChanged event did not return TransferTimedOut status           after client-side timeout* When SaveLocationPromptType set to 2, hitting cancel in the save dialog             caused browser crash* When SaveLocationPromptType set to 1, hitting cancel in the folder               dialog caused browser hang* If user cancelled uploads and TransferStatusChanged events were being                 handled, browser would sometimes crash* Chunked-encoded uploads caused erroneous timeout error* Files uploaded or downloaded with the visual objects did not appear                     "checked" if the upload completed through a resume operation* Calling RemoveAll on the visual upload and download controls did not                       remove files from the underlying file collection of the XFRequest object* Setting client-side timeout value to 0 caused browser freezing* Error thrown when xfclient.dll not registered referred to incorrect                           dll name* Buffer overrun in SSL transfers caused browser crash* Issue with XFResume.Close prevented the XFResume object from being                               reopened\** XFile returned non-JobId folders when checking ResumeInfo collection\*  \*XFile Enterprise Edition only | |  | | **Differences Between V2.1.7 and V2.2.3** | |  | | **New Features:**  * Added new methods to sync events when XFile is run in scripting or   VBA environments* New Event for the XFRequest object: OnStatusChange | | **Issue Resolved:**  * Changed the way cached headers were being added to the Resumed Request* When not using WinInet, sometimes Response headers were being lost* In some cases, chunked-transfer encoded downloads were not being correctly       interpreted as failures | |  | | **Differences Between V2.1.6 and V2.1.7** | |  | | **Issue Resolved:**  * Renamed WebClnt.Dll to XFClient.dll due to a naming conflict with   a Windows XP dll* Under certain circumstances, the Request Record for resumable downloads     would not be updated, resulting in the same file being concatenated     with itself* In some cases, a DNS or Unresolvable Host error would return a Response       Status of 0 and would not throw an exception | |  | | **Differences Between V2.1.5 and V2.1.6** | |  | | **Issue Resolved:**  * Under some circumstances, authentication did not work | |  | | **Differences Between V2.1.4 and V2.1.5** | |  | | **Issues Resolved:**  * On Windows 95/98/ME, using the Visual Upload Control (AXFFile) caused   IE to crash intermittently* The Add File Selector for the Visual Upload Control (AXFFile) on some     foreign versions of Windows did not render correctly* Some file view types (for the Add Files Selector) did not work on       Windows XP* When forcing a multipart/form-data request that does not contain files,         an extra CRLF appeared after the last form element* An error occurred when setting DiscardResponse to true when using           the Visual Download Control (AXFFileDownload) | |  | | **Differences Between V2.1.3 and V2.1.4** | |  | | **Issue Resolved:**  * The download folder selection dialog was missing the folder list view   when used asynchronously | |  | | **Differences Between V2.0.3 and V2.1.3** ||  | | **New Features:**  * Customize column headings for the upload and download visual controls.* New Property: FileNameColumnWidth = 0 - 100. This is the percentage     of the width of the list view. Also, setting AXFFileDownload.HideURL     to false now sets the width of the URL column to 0 or this property     to 100.* Ability to disable the animated gif image in the progress indicator.* OpenAfterDownload functionality is now customizable.* New Property OpenAfterDownloadIndex on the XFrequest object. Possible           values and their meaning:           + 0: Open all files until the first error occurs, default for backwards             compatibility+ -1: Open all files, unless an error occurs for that file+ i: Open only the specified index (1-based)* New method OpenInApplication() on the XFFile object. This can be used             in conjunction with the DownloadError object to open files after download.* Ability to use our visual progress indicator with a non-visual file               transfer: added the XFRequestStream property to the XFRequest object.* Added better control of File Selector (part of AXFFile). The following                 new properties and methods have been added:                 + FileViewType = SAFileViewType. The default is List.

To specify                         multiple FilterPatterns for a single display string, use a semicolon                         to separate the patterns (for example, "\*.TXT;\*.DOC;\*.BAK"). A pattern                         string can be a combination of valid file name characters and the                         asterisk (\*) wildcard character. Do not include spaces in the pattern                         string.+ ClearFileSelectorFilters Description: Clears all filters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## SoftArtisans XFile FileManager ActiveX control stack buffer overflows

#### Vulnerability Note VU#914785

Original Release Date: 2008-08-25 | Last Revised: 2008-08-25

---

### Overview

The SoftArtisans XFile FileManager ActiveX control contains several stack buffer overflows, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| SoftArtisans XFile is an ActiveX file transfer application. The XFile FileManager ActiveX control, which is included with XFile, contains multiple stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities. The XFile FileManager ActiveX control is provided by the file SAFmgPws.dll. Vulnerable methods include BuildPath(), GetDriveName(), DriveExists(), and DeleteFile(). |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause Internet Explorer (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This vulnerability addressed in SoftArtisans XFile 2.4.0. Please see the [release notes](http://support.softartisans.com/Support-114.aspx) for more details. |
| --- |

| **Disable the XFile FileManager ActiveX control in Internet Explorer**The vulnerable ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID:{E7B62F4E-82F4-11D2-BD41-00105A0A7E89}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{E7B62F4E-82F4-11D2-BD41-00105A0A7E89}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400**Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the "[Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer)" document. |
