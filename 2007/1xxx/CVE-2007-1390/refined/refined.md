Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2007-1390:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary root cause is the lack of proper authentication checks in the `admin` directory of the Dynaliens application. Certain files within this directory, specifically `validlien.php3`, `supprlien.php3`, `supprub.php3`, `validlien.php3`, `confsuppr.php3`, `modiflien.php3`, and `confmodif.php3`, can be accessed directly without requiring authentication.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious script or HTML injection via the `recherche.php3` and `ajouter.php3` files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability lies in the flawed authentication mechanism that can be bypassed by directly accessing specific PHP files.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS due to insufficient input sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the application's admin console, which allows performing privileged actions without valid credentials. This could lead to full control of the application.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker can inject arbitrary scripts, which may allow them to perform actions like stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The attacker can bypass authentication by directly requesting vulnerable PHP files like `validlien.php3`, located under the admin directory.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting:** The attacker can inject malicious scripts by supplying unsanitized parameters to the `recherche.php3` or `ajouter.php3` pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote access:** The attacker can be remote as these vulnerabilities are accessible through the web.
*   **No authentication needed for bypass:** For the authentication bypass, no prior authentication is required; the attacker directly accesses vulnerable files.
*   **User interaction for XSS:** While the XSS is remote, a victim needs to load the page with the injected script for it to be executed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified in Dynaliens versions 2.0 and 2.1.
*   The severity is rated as "Medium" overall, though the authentication bypass is a more serious issue than the XSS vulnerability.
*   The authentication bypass allows an attacker to perform privileged actions.
*   The XSS vulnerability is present on the `recherche.php3` and `ajouter.php3` pages.

The provided information gives specific technical details regarding how the authentication bypass works. By appending specific file names within the /admin directory an attacker gains access to the admin panel. The XSS vulnerability is mentioned to be exploitable via the `recherche.php3` and `ajouter.php3` files.
