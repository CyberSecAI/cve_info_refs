Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1622:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of the `PHP_SELF` variable in the `wp-admin/vars.php` file of WordPress. This variable, which contains the path of the currently executing script, is not properly sanitized before being used in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. An attacker can manipulate the `PHP_SELF` variable to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the web page, which will be executed by the victim's browser.
*   **Bypassing CSRF Protection:**  The improper handling of `PHP_SELF` allows bypassing the CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection mechanism used in the WordPress administration interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser session.
*   **Account Takeover:** If the victim is an administrator, the attacker could potentially gain full control of the WordPress site.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker could steal cookies, session information, or other sensitive data.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites or initiate drive-by downloads.
*   **Defacement:**  The attacker could modify or deface the content of the WordPress website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a specific URL with a manipulated `PATH_INFO` component that is then reflected in the output through the `PHP_SELF` variable.
*   The vulnerability is in the administrative interface (`wp-admin/`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with the "theme" privileges, which means they have the ability to modify theme files.
*   **Knowledge of Target Theme:** The attacker needs to know the currently active theme of the target WordPress site to craft a precise exploit that will inject malicious code where the vulnerable `PHP_SELF` variable is echoed.
*   **Theme Modification Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the theme files.
*   **Target Interaction**: An authenticated user with write access to theme files needs to visit the manipulated url, thereby triggering the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet in `wp-admin/vars.php` extracts the filename from the `PHP_SELF` variable using a regular expression:
    ```php
    if ( preg_match('#([^/]+\.php)$#', $PHP_SELF, $self_matches) ) {
        $pagenow = $self_matches[1];
    }
    ```
*   The issue is that the `$PHP_SELF` variable itself is not sanitized, and can contain characters that will lead to HTML injection.
*   The injected code is then used inside the `wp_nonce_ays()` function in `wp-admin/functions.php`, which directly includes the unsanitized `$PHP_SELF` output into the HTML.
    ```php
    $html .= "\t\n";
    ```
*   An example provided shows how an attacker could inject code by setting  `$PHP_SELF` to:  `index.php/'>![](a)<.php`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in WordPress versions 2.0.10 RC2 and 2.1.3 RC2.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Alexander Concha, and independently reported on sla.ckers.org by Jungsonn.
*   The vulnerability can be used to bypass WordPress's CSRF protection.
