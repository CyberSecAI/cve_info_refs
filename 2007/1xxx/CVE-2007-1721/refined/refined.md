Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1721:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an insecure file inclusion in `lib/Richtxt_functions.inc.php` and other files within C-Arbre. The `root_path` parameter, used in `include_once("$root_path/include/Wikitxt_functions.inc.php");`, is not properly sanitized before being used in the include function, which enables remote file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include remote files via the `root_path` parameter, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to validate the `root_path` parameter before using it in an include statement.
- **Reliance on `register_globals`:** The exploit relies on the `register_globals` PHP setting being enabled, which is a deprecated and insecure practice.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain system access by including and executing malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to vulnerable scripts such as `lib/Richtxt_functions.inc.php`, `lib/adddocfile.php`, and others, appending a malicious URL to the `root_path` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **PHP `register_globals` Enabled:** The target server must have the `register_globals` PHP setting enabled for the exploit to work.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is present in C-Arbre versions <= 0.6PR7.
- Multiple files are affected.
- The vulnerability is documented in the advisory `http://advisories.echo.or.id/adv/adv78-K-159-2007.txt`.
-  A list of vulnerable files is provided
- Proof of concept exploit URLs are provided, showing how to inject remote files via the `root_path` parameter.
- Mitigation steps are provided: sanitize input, disable `register_globals`.
