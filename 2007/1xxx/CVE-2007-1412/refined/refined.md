{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `cpdf_open()` function in PHP 4.4.6 improperly handles long strings provided as the second parameter, leading to a source code disclosure vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Source code disclosure. The vulnerability arises from the `cpdf_open()` function not properly sanitizing or handling a long string, causing it to be included in an error message, thus revealing potentially sensitive source code.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information, such as passwords and other variables, by triggering the vulnerability. This information can then be used for further attacks or unauthorized access.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local exploitation. The attacker must be able to execute PHP code on the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to execute PHP code on the target server and the `cpdf` extension needs to be loaded."
