Package        : wordpress
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-1622 CVE-2007-1893 CVE-2007-1894 CVE-2007-1897

CVE-2007-1622
    Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in wp-admin/vars.php in
    WordPress before 2.0.10 RC2, and before 2.1.3 RC2 in the 2.1 series,
    allows remote authenticated users with theme privileges to inject
    arbitrary web script or HTML via the PATH_INFO in the administration
    interface, related to loose regular expression processing of PHP_SELF.

CVE-2007-1893
    WordPress 2.1.2, and probably earlier, allows remote authenticated
    users with the contributor role to bypass intended access restrictions
    and invoke the publish_posts functionality, which can be used to
    "publish a previously saved post."

CVE-2007-1894
    Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
    wp-includes/general-template.php in WordPress before 20070309 allows
    remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the year
    parameter in the wp_title function.

CVE-2007-1897
    SQL injection vulnerability in xmlrpc.php in WordPress 2.1.2, and
    probably earlier, allows remote authenticated users to execute
    arbitrary SQL commands via a string parameter value in an XML RPC
    mt.setPostCategories method call, related to the post_id variable.

For the stable distribution (etch) these issues have been fixed in
version 2.0.10-1.

For the testing and unstable distributions (lenny and etch,
respectively), these issues have been fixed in version 2.1.3-1

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian (stable)
- ---------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

Source archives:

  <http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/w/wordpress/wordpress_2.0.10-1.diff.gz>
    Size/MD5 checksum:     8967 a9975366a65611eb333557603ca18b00
  <http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/w/wordpress/wordpress_2.0.10.orig.tar.gz>
    Size/MD5 checksum:   520314 e9d5373b3c6413791f864d56b473dd54
  <http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/w/wordpress/wordpress_2.0.10-1.dsc>
    Size/MD5 checksum:      561 baaa9fd3c5e532e30043b8a2a11be6aa

Architecture independent packages:

  <http://security.debian.org/pool/updates/main/w/wordpress/wordpress_2.0.10-1_all.deb>
    Size/MD5 checksum:   529582 369bb4778790a5b3aa79584bcc7ea8ec

  These files will probably be moved into the stable distribution on
  its next update.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
