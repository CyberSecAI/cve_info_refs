```
>From a BUGTRAQ posting last month,
  PHP Point Of Sale for osCommerce <= (index.php) Remote File Include
Vuln
  <http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=117399405001938&w=2>

In index.php:
> <?php
>  session_start();
>  include ("settings.php");
>  include ("language/$cfg_language");

>From the download, settings.php exists, but is empty.
According to the readme.txt file, the user is suppose to install
the application via install/index.php. Here, the user is prompted
to select their language, which is passed to install/installer.php.

In installer.php:
> <?php
> $language=$_POST['language'];
>
> $info="
> <?php
>    \$cfg_language=\"$language\";
>
> ?>";
>        $open = fopen( "../settings.php", "w+" ) or die ( "Operation
Failed!" );
>        fputs( $open, "$info" );
>        fclose( $open );
>
>
> include("../settings.php");
> include("../language/$cfg_language");

So, this is no issue if the user follows the installation instructions.
