Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the PHP Point Of Sale for osCommerce application handles language settings during installation. Specifically, the `installer.php` script takes user-supplied input for the language and writes it to `settings.php` file. Subsequently, both `index.php` and `installer.php` include the language file based on the `$cfg_language` variable which was previously written to the settings file. If the user does not follow the installation procedure, the `$cfg_language` variable will be uninitialized, causing a Local File Inclusion (LFI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The vulnerability lies in the ability to control the `$cfg_language` variable through the installation process. If the user does not complete the installation steps and provides a malicious path for language, the application will include this file.

*   **Uninitialized Variable:** When the installation procedure is not followed, the `$cfg_language` variable within `settings.php` is left uninitialized (empty or missing). This variable is then directly used to construct the path for the language file to be included by `index.php` and `installer.php` in the form of `include("language/$cfg_language");`. This can lead to the inclusion of local files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage this LFI vulnerability to include and potentially read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that the web server user has access to. This could expose sensitive information like database credentials, configuration files, or even source code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Request to `index.php` without installation:** An attacker can access the `index.php` file without going through the proper installation steps, causing `$cfg_language` to be uninitialized and potentially be controllable.
*  **Malicious language parameter**: If the attacker can manipulate the language variable, or if the install script is left open, this will set the `$cfg_language` to be a malicious file path, which is then included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable application and the `index.php` script.
*   They do not need any specific privileges on the server, access to a web browser is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability by directly accessing the file, and manipulating the `language` parameter if install script is accessible.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The original post classifies this as "FALSE" vulnerability. This classification is related to the fact that the described vulnerability occurs only if the installation is not followed, which would lead to the described LFI.

*   The vulnerability is present in PHP Point of Sale for osCommerce <= index.php.
