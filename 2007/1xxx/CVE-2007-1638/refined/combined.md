Overview:
Quoting http://www.phprojekt.com/features.php?&newlang=eng
"PHProjekt is a modular application for the coordination of group
activities and to share informations and document via the web.
Components of PHProjekt: Group calendar, project management, time card
system, file management, contact manager, mail client and many other
modules.
PHProjekt supports many protocols like ldap, xml/soap and webdav and
is available for 38 languages and 9 databases."
Description:
In detail, the following flaws were determined during a quick source
code review for the modules Projects, Contacts, Helpdesk, Notes, Search
and Mail.
During the validation the php.ini setting "magic\_quotes\_gpc" was
deactivated.
PHProjekt using an internal a CSRF protection (see function
check\_csrftoken() in lib/lib.inc.php).
By calling this function the return value is always true. Due to incorrect
output validation in many modules, such as Mail or Filemanager,
Cross Site Request Forgery is possible.
Finally, the Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability also affect the
summary page, which is PHProjekt's index page.
Remarks
-------
There may be other modules which are affected, but they have not been
subject to review at this point.
Solution:
The vulnerabilities were reported on Dec 31 2006 and an update has
been released on Mar 14 2007.

# PHProjekt: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200706-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHProjekt, allowing for
the execution of arbitrary PHP and SQL code, and cross-site scripting
attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/phprojekt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.2.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.2.1** |

### Background

PHProjekt is a project management and coordination tool written in PHP.

### Description

Alexios Fakos from n.runs AG has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in
PHProjekt, including the execution of arbitrary SQL commands using
unknown vectors (CVE-2007-1575), the execution of arbitrary PHP code
using an unrestricted file upload (CVE-2007-1639), cross-site request
forgeries using different modules (CVE-2007-1638), and a cross-site
scripting attack using unkown vectors (CVE-2007-1576).

### Impact

An authenticated user could elevate their privileges by exploiting the
vulnerabilities described above. Note that the magic\_quotes\_gpc PHP
configuration setting must be set to "off" to exploit these
vulnerabilities.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PHProjekt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/phprojekt-5.2.1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
