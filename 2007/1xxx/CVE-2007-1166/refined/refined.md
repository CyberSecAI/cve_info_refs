Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1166:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `result.php` script in Nabopoll does not properly sanitize the `surv` parameter before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the script directly incorporates the `$survey` variable, derived from the `surv` GET parameter, into a SQL query without any filtering or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the unsanitized `surv` parameter. This is a blind SQL injection, as the attacker cannot directly see the results of their query, but can infer them by observing changes in the application's behavior, particularly the response content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by crafting specific SQL queries. The provided exploit demonstrates extracting the MySQL user by iteratively checking each character. This could be expanded to extract other database information such as user credentials, site configurations, or survey results.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `result.php` script, specifically the `surv` GET parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Nabopoll application. They do not need any prior authentication. They just need knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and the structure of the SQL query to perform blind SQL injection.
