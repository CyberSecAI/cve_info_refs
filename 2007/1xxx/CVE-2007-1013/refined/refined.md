Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1013:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled inclusion of a file specified by the `ht_pfad` parameter in the `generate.php` script of the "Htaccess Passwort Generator 1.1" application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes the content of a file path provided by the user via the `ht_pfad` parameter without sufficient sanitization or validation. This allows for the injection of malicious code by specifying a URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** By crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `generate.php` script and setting the `ht_pfad` parameter to a remote URL containing malicious PHP code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable application is hosted.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `ht_pfad` parameter is used to include files.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit-db entry provides the following vulnerable code snippet:
```php
include ($ht_pfad."/tpl/ok.html");
```
and the following exploit example:
```
http://target/[path]/generate.php?ht_pfad=3vil script?
```

This confirms that the application directly includes the path given in the 'ht_pfad' parameter, without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to include a remote file, such as one hosted on an attacker-controlled server, and thus execute arbitrary code.
