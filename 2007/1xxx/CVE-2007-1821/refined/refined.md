The provided content describes a vulnerability in certain voice mail systems that rely on Caller ID (CNID) for authenticating administrative access.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the voice mail systems trusting Calling Number Identification (CNID, Caller ID) for administrative access authentication. Caller ID can be easily spoofed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Authentication:** Using Caller ID alone for authentication is insecure as it can be easily spoofed.
- **Lack of Password/PIN Authentication:** The vulnerability is present in systems that do not require a password or PIN for administrative access to voice mail accounts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain administrative access to a voice mailbox.
- Depending on the system, the attacker could listen to and delete messages, change the greeting message, or make other modifications.
- By changing the greeting message, an attacker may be able to charge calls to an account with a vulnerable voice mail system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Spoofing Caller ID using freely available PBX software and a H.323/VOIP gateway service, or possibly via other methods.
- Calling the voice mail system using the spoofed caller ID matching the phone number associated with the target voice mailbox.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to spoof Caller ID (e.g., using readily available PBX software and H.323/VOIP gateway).
- Knowledge of the target phone number associated with the voice mail account.
