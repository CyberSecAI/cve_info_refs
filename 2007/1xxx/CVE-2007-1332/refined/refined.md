Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-1332:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The ePortfolio application relies entirely on client-side JavaScript for input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The lack of server-side validation allows attackers to bypass client-side checks by manipulating requests. This is a classical vulnerability due to insecure implementation relying on client side security.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the application.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) / Session Riding:** Attackers can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of legitimate users.
*   **General Input Validation Issues:**  The lack of server-side input validation allows for many types of attacks. The advisory explicitly mentions that "an attacker may realize nearly every attack that relies on lacking input-validation".

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Proxy Manipulation:**  Attackers can use tools like BURPproxy or WebScarab to intercept and modify requests before they reach the server, thus bypassing client-side validation. This is a common way for attackers to send unvalidated input.
*   **Remote exploitation**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify web requests.
*   **Web Proxy Usage:** The attacker needs the ability to use a web proxy to manipulate the data sent to the web server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects ePortfolio version 1.0 Java and possibly earlier versions.
*   The advisory indicates that the application uses "heavy amounts of javascript code", which is a cause of the problem.
*   The advisory mentions that the vendor is aware of the issue and plans to address it in the next release.
*   No PoC code is provided in the advisory.
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a Medium risk.
*   The issue was discovered by Stefan Friedli from scip AG.

**Summary of Findings**

The identified vulnerability stems from the complete reliance on client-side JavaScript for input validation within the ePortfolio application. This allows attackers to bypass these checks by manipulating web requests using proxy tools. The exploitation can lead to XSS and CSRF attacks.
