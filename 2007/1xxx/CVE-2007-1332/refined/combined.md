-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
ePortfolio version 1.0 Java Multiple Input Validation Vulnerabilities
scip AG Vulnerability ID 2893 (12/22/2006)
http://www.scip.ch/cgi-bin/smss/showadvf.pl?id=2893
I. INTRODUCTION
ePortfolio is a e-banking application by TKS Banking Solutions.
More information is available on the vendors web site at the following URL:
http://www.tksbankingsolutions.com/
II. DESCRIPTION
Stefan Friedli found several web-based vulnerabilities that were
identified in ePortfolio version 1.0 Java and may affect earlier
versions as well.
The application uses heavy amounts of javascript code for operation. As
this is not generally a bad thing, it causes massive problems when it
comes to data validation. As we recognized, the entire validation of
input is realized by client-side javascript which can easily be bypassed
using a Proxy BURPproxy or WebScarab to modify original requests sent
(and validated) by the browser.
We assume this vulnerability to exist in nearly every form offered by
the application. Due to the limited functionality of the account used
for testing, we're not able to definitely confirm or deny this fact.
PoC Code is not being published.
IV. IMPACT
As there is a serious lack of server-side measured to protect the
application from malicious input, an attacker may realize nearly every
attack that relies on lacking input-validation which includes Cross Site
Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery (Session Riding) .
V. DETECTION
Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or
intrusion detection system. Patterns for detection of basic attacks are
available and easy to implement, though they may possibly fail on more
sophisticated attacks.
VI. SOLUTION
Server-side input validation should be provied by the application vendor
as soon as possible.
VII. VENDOR RESPONSE
The problems were recognized and will, according to the vendor, be
adressed with the next release by the end of this week. Further, the
vendor claims to be able to change the faulty behaviour remotely or by
editing a non-specified file for existing customers.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |
