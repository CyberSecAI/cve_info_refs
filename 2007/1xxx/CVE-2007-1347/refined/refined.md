{
  "CVE-2007-1347": {
    "Root cause": "A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the ole32.dll library when parsing OLE document summary information, specifically due to malformed pointers in the document.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption vulnerability in ole32.dll when processing malformed OLE document summary information",
      "Improper handling of arbitrary values when parsing OLE documents."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (at minimum), potential for arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption. Explorer.exe can crash.",
    "Attack vectors": "Accessing a specially crafted OLE document (e.g., .doc) file, which could be delivered via website or email attachments, or even by accessing a directory containing the file. The vulnerability is triggered when Windows attempts to parse the OLE document summary information. Malformed pointers within the document can cause the crash.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to create a specially crafted OLE document with malformed pointers. The attacker does not need specific privileges on the target system. The victim needs to access the crafted file, for example, by opening it, or even just by having it appear in a directory view."
