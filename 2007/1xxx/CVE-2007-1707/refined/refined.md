```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application improperly includes files based on user-controlled input from the 'cms' GET parameter without sufficient sanitization.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability due to the use of user-supplied input in the `include` statement.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is accessed through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file, specifically using the `cms` parameter to specify a remote URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
