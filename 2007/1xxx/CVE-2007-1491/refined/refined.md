{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Apache Tomcat port 8009 is unnecessarily exposed to external interfaces.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unnecessary open port on external interfaces.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "While the built-in firewall filters port 8009 by default, the unnecessary external exposure could potentially be exploited if firewall rules are misconfigured or circumvented.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network access to port 8009 on external interfaces.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have network access to the exposed port 8009 on the affected system."
