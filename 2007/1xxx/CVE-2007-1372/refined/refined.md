Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1372:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content indicates that CVE-2007-1372 is associated with a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the "PostGuestbook" module for PHP-Nuke.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure inclusion of files within the `header.php` script of the PostGuestbook module. Specifically, the `$tpl_pgb_moddir` variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL into this variable through the query string. This is then used in an `include` statement, leading to the inclusion of an attacker-controlled remote file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include a remote file by manipulating the `tpl_pgb_moddir` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The module fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the value of the `tpl_pgb_moddir` parameter, before using it in a file inclusion function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This could lead to complete server compromise, data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `header.php` script of the PostGuestbook module. The attacker provides a malicious URL as the value of the `tpl_pgb_moddir` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP GET request with a specific parameter.

**Exploit Code Example:**
The provided exploit code is:
`[VicTim]/modules/postguestbook/styles/internal/header.php?tpl_pgb_moddir=Shell.php?`
This demonstrates how an attacker would inject a remote file named 'Shell.php' through the `tpl_pgb_moddir` parameter to include and potentially execute it.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected version is PostGuestbook 0.6.1.
- The exploit was discovered by GoLd\_M.
