Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1470:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in multiple buffer overflows within the LIBFtp library, specifically in the `sprintf()` and `strcpy()` functions when handling input strings. The library uses a fixed-size buffer (`FtpString`, which is a typedef for `char[256]`) for storing data. When the data to be copied or formatted using `sprintf` or `strcpy` exceeds this buffer size, a buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Multiple Buffer Overflows:** The vulnerability exists in several functions including `FtpChmod`, `FtpArchie`, `FtpDebugDebug`, `FtpOpenDir`, and `FtpSize`.
- **Unsafe String Handling:** The usage of `sprintf` and `strcpy` without proper bounds checking leads to the buffer overflows.
- **Fixed-Size Buffer:** The use of a fixed-size buffer (`FtpString`) creates a limitation that can easily be exceeded by attacker-controlled input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A successful buffer overflow could allow an attacker to overwrite parts of the process's memory including the stack or heap and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server or client machine.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflows could also cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Data Corruption:** Overwriting memory could corrupt data, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or application failure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Manipulated FTP Commands:** By sending specially crafted arguments in FTP commands such as `CHMOD`, `NLST`, `SIZE`, attackers can trigger overflows in the associated functions.
- **Long Filenames:** Providing excessively long filenames to `FtpSize`, `FtpOpenDir`, or any function that uses them.
- **Long `what` string in `FtpArchie`**: The `what` parameter to `FtpArchie` is formatted into a command line which can overflow the `cmd` variable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to communicate with an application using the vulnerable LIBFtp library, usually through the FTP protocol.
- **Control Over FTP Client:** The attacker needs to have some level of control over the input being sent to the FTP client or server that is using the library.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Functions:** Knowledge of how to trigger the vulnerable functions and craft the overflow.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code demonstrates how an attacker can overflow the buffer in the `FtpSize` function by providing a long string as a filename.
- The vulnerability is described as remote, meaning it can be exploited over a network.
- The vulnerability has a high-risk rating with a base CVSS score of 6.8/10, indicating the severity of the impact.
- The `strcpy` in `FtpDebugDebug` can be triggered with an overly long `Message`
