Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue caused by the insecure use of the `include()` function in the `include/default_header.php` file of CyBoards PHP Lite version 1.21. Specifically, the `$script_path` variable is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to control the path of the included file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include a remote file into the application via the unsanitized `$script_path` variable. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server hosting the vulnerable CyBoards installation. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, defacement, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `include/default_header.php` file, where the `script_path` parameter can be manipulated.
- The exploit provided demonstrates how to inject a URL into `script_path` parameter pointing to a file containing PHP code, effectively executing it when the header file is processed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable CyBoards instance.
- The attacker needs access to a web server where they can host the malicious PHP file they intend to include.
- No authentication or prior knowledge of the application structure is required for successful exploitation.
- The attacker can be a remote user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information indicates that this vulnerability was fixed in version 1.25 of CyBoards by changing the `include()` statement to a static link to the css file, thus removing the remote file inclusion vulnerability.
- The exploit code also shows that the attacker can specify a variable to send commands.
