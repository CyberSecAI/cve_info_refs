# Apache HTTP Server 2.2 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.2. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.2 is End-of-Life since December 2017 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before the End-of-Life. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.2 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.35-never

### low: Use-after-free when using <Limit > with an unrecognized method in .htaccess ("OptionsBleed") ([CVE-2017-9798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9798))

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Hanno Böck for reporting this issue.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### important: mod\_ssl Null Pointer Dereference ([CVE-2017-3169](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3169))

mod\_ssl may dereference a NULL pointer when third-party modules call ap\_hook\_process\_connection() during an HTTP request to an HTTPS port.

### important: ap\_find\_token() Buffer Overread ([CVE-2017-7668](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-7668))

The HTTP strict parsing changes added in 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a bug in token list parsing, which allows ap\_find\_token() to search past the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap\_find\_token() to return an incorrect value.

### important: Uninitialized memory reflection in mod\_auth\_digest ([CVE-2017-9788](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9788))

The value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments. by mod\_auth\_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a segfault.

### moderate: mod\_userdir CRLF injection ([CVE-2016-4975](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-4975))

Possible CRLF injection allowing HTTP response splitting attacks for sites which use mod\_userdir. This issue was mitigated by changes made in 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 which prohibit CR or LF injection into the "Location" or other outbound header key or value.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Dominic Scheirlinck and Scott Geary of Vend for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### moderate: mod\_dav crash ([CVE-2013-6438](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-6438))

XML parsing code in mod\_dav incorrectly calculates the end of the string when removing leading spaces and places a NUL character outside the buffer, causing random crashes. This XML parsing code is only used with DAV provider modules that support DeltaV, of which the only publicly released provider is mod\_dav\_svn.

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### important: Timeout detection flaw (mod\_proxy\_http) ([CVE-2010-2068](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2068))

An information disclosure flaw was found in mod\_proxy\_http in versions 2.2.9 through 2.2.15, 2.3.4-alpha and 2.3.5-alpha. Under certain timeout conditions, the server could return a response intended for another user. Only Windows, Netware and OS2 operating systems are affected. Only those configurations which trigger the use of proxy worker pools are affected. There was no vulnerability on earlier versions, as proxy pools were not yet introduced.

The simplest workaround is to globally configure;

SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### moderate: mod\_proxy crash ([CVE-2007-3847](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3847))

A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod\_proxy module. On sites where a reverse proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker could cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a malicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded Multi-Processing Module.

# Apache: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache, possibly resulting
in a Denial of Service or the disclosure of sensitive information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.6** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.0.59-r5**>= **2.2.6** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

### Description

Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
mod\_status and mod\_autoindex (CVE-2006-5752, CVE-2007-4465). An error
has been discovered in the recall\_headers() function in mod\_mem\_cache
(CVE-2007-1862). The mod\_cache module does not properly sanitize
requests before processing them (CVE-2007-1863). The Prefork module
does not properly check PID values before sending signals
(CVE-2007-3304). The mod\_proxy module does not correctly check headers
before processing them (CVE-2007-3847).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit one of these vulnerabilities to inject
arbitrary script or HTML content, obtain sensitive information or cause
a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.59-r5"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=41551#c0)  Xuekun Hu    2007-02-06 23:22:42 UTC  ``` Hi,  I'm using Apache2.2.4 (worker+mod_mem_cache). I just used mod_mem_cache to  cache some little files. However after run severl minutes, I found the file  content sent by mod_mem_cache are incorrect!!   I captured the response package. And I found those error packages are sending   the wrong http headers, like including several headers, wrong ETag value. Seems  like memory overflow!! For example, one response are: -----------------------------------------------------------------------  HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Thu, 25 Jan 2007 11:30:51 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.4 (Unix) mod_jk/1.2.15 Last-Modified: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT ETag: 2<uwJU@x@)IzNFELwphctT&^r^MvqY kP\k'gZ@Zrs3a-_S+"A@z%49o[9nyUX^-eR9j1*(lp9B4A3)R]J2?yi:sbVxZJV ?('9e@tFn$>.cokt;ao/V|^tXj\UIo-|Xz6YX(nXE9:y/OcK5Yl7]%D3`#s=+;o cZci>tNQ+|UUp5RETf>f72<{b*0ICP*gz0>'|2UAY'4VeIfL;?4S>*0t9:V9B|B hML1)p?]grrJ/ku4`h/'N(H63PEi@$qfiP<;f,$7a<Ogy7<[rR]!TMZf{c1($]M -a_Sb,W`09|)D|NnaD`jHrd*h4ck6]W&xy?sv)]uVZ#u?d!^q/TBM1sD\&."SM/ Ad.W1[2)(2RgwQO.2^wQ|/s?^9np7MiN:9/A|V.xki1C8u164bo6pD,#>Jl2IX, ZdOG;b4>ET>|%2[6Sv;vE_eLhtFhj\jlyA@QQKj`k3/ONE="7j'Ty.73`w&a-DE l%@X&H:T*,x\@BbVPST!)Tbfjh0RS+yUI@',{sMP\I'z:M?_"dQadTN;"ob&_w` EE[)\wj{'r:&]J|H%%j#W8>)0bZrJzlHH4:vLw[xyrtC]IY9%_pH-R8l(3?V#-N fqo,?$R"<aE6aa1N7iU,,(>,Bv2zk<Z+Gqg'"O\nFxV/Zpz3I(_Z|hYi26f!n'X tp`fyb!iqrBV7e6(h?6'zKL@PGc$bJsgc1$ZkrHL<tYJ1OFb,_h'5]!$XrMB^]! 94/>=OObnMgS33U'bg+Uf26dC:!4`8h_n>'w>U0/!mqc6-9yD#gN%.pV3DeJHsE KNfI+wCCH]BPin<sChB21XKr1+pgDuWLzHGOkg>Jg0F'q,_I|M^$cnVbi7cU-T$ =eFc;h(8jov[Adbcy#>-n7G3l!DU!>f!zDx.#q42T1i-Z)H"4e*M6.`jhLnj0P" +.H[yP'n?b7=KmoTwGCg,@rbV1Qf5n[4rRn\$7yB^/`zu?='@v3h$RdG7wJQY)K 1e/&zO5y-w5q("?NQmuPa"PAi.;-Os0NN>Nx/8Qk(kEb/0pILMbRd!Dd>3s80D/ o1s3@"#iSV0!"CJlDuDKlkmh41_s+>$*K?F{-i@Uz(+16t#xlqF""\SZ!-)miPG U[PkYIO!Yfuz'tlGNb|`6[983jtwyB?F?A8Xmr*[@+^F|AuW!/o9k:50d)T)Twq `f"n(?ou;(*ZBL-3=9Ue)\]Y[p1nNEI'lf2lNF3KS4BI()6smg1?q(bc'.0[b&O F;=?q=V'&Lyq+_VGke@H*`$32\d[@3W<DS"[bV0^-c/wVX"+F(@#)r*/{5"LAxH IJI#(SXmlmak6+]4n+p-F;]5V&00er+JQ[;hU]GR4+eXJ_]T;Cx*LS!|:m$#3G8 |vgF]TA_/d!G#Z,5-sTV,^J4UurZ['?,v$5\IDRcV(]`dN?.H`1@5ll1n7pq7([ '\eoDI1&R0#R*`VS8Mjy[q&{q&h<h=1x{CD[w'(5]SQ*)`uty*|(41&:n3%*dRq RD9s:61RDRK3XO?n/TIF-dmK]1c0#Vgo@#0XLM1{x4s/w;M':j#GU=.ubloj@N# Y=fI-2c{{^_?/tOIr$5jq&xpAaT_hc0XqE.Hbge6{76^h@ek/GH@Hi>TBob(;c+ i,8OS2aTS_dv5j*e^VCE`+UIU&y@S7huO!Xj?mTmz#Z,Ca0W-z2X%HysN[NxO{g TDSvcaFVVz_3ms5*uV)bdA^K52p`UKO[HZ<WzVFUUECIcJjD2cIKxxW?{a?Sa/M P;kma`)4q#*?'xjO1L-*BUuUjwDOHcUEFE1;oGwzQl!lzko2x5]@62$P{aRY*"3 o.m"1oT/q93&{(#M<g)!c^h$F--,Nnk|<.#Q:7L+$e(*@S3xJiFTJuYZ@Wf^\Q( s4GQ#arbPmAg5T{70$KnVbbTsyc4fe'_*xf6W?$ExHU6_;>b4;$oKOX`4j*aApl K#?s[/PwP6DkqxZB`Z:j?:Kdt;'^{wCLh|662k_k<pbm|&QbVBlt/LWjeBLKDVS {kHTiH@w(1TIxwp"T2*5u){aMWoOsif4J5?lT"@C,vAKX!>^,wl`I58FBY3#e@& +%1t&m@m4.m6L>q^5l3V',J?FPhC-_$:X,>t#yB"0!UgEHG.>eVJIzu)K|gJh"? hmXf%bz3pHTzGHQ'A[9:vW-y_Fkunqalva%pu0vo8RBZE*{G1e=c(c-.`N,<J_T D'$7I2XJpxgxT&h4mH-t+yr`DGK.8N]_=?ZB)V-84U(L7XrA+'MC|;,k*][XY0L !::f@Zm]xAlQo`?FFJ)=>3Sp5Y,FDJLfp;(WST{U]MK$'Z0PbfrE&gk1grzC.l* 27<X%nau9%&]<IYA+.sA`9C|KLf@o^S2FAgB+]U8MkG_]G5?eg4&{2P#iLKenxT fq(1LM,rn1@33.9]xp6;@FJPPFQYD"@>ED'D%nfkj;-qEK1[d^wV:i,"NLuylTN /E(82(nsb,a`8')I=$jP6?8Z.4IH7NE@@$4l:79J/dCU@`=37bT(Opd"`n;(dk& p6*F-#x!W<no$;Di2%s_]SmXlYgfhEiyTcv`0'PB`[[SP@cl:HM5B*[jvAkUvra ff=fCE0?P2DqySbc{W5E@[-Bj3-S3,TT_o&=ek:sY(8a_HubaCTX+,,3PFL5.Ap wWU%^Ohf!9WnizXy|sd.t[qftGmF(.&_fEF6\s`dvRfAg+R8q(Hv"9</pre> </body> </html>  Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 2170 Expires: Fri, 26 Jan 2007 11:27:58 GMT Age: 107 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1  Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 90 Expires: Fri, 26 Jan 2007 11:27:11 GMT Age: 158 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 ... ---------------------------------------------------------------------  While I also tested Apache2.2.3+mod_mem_cache, Apache2.2.4 without  mod_mem_cache, Apache2.2.4+mod_disk_cache, all work fine.  So, there must something wrong in mod_mem_cache itself.  I compared with mod_mem_cache in 2.2.3 vs. 2.2.4, the big change is using APR  memory pool to cache http header, instead of malloc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CVE-2006-5752  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mod_status.c in the mod_status module in Apache HTTP Server (httpd), when ExtendedStatus is enabled and a public server-status page is used, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors involving charsets with browsers that perform "charset detection" when the content-type is not specified.  CVE-2007-1863  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mod_status.c in the mod_status module in Apache HTTP Server (httpd), when ExtendedStatus is enabled and a public server-status page is used, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors involving charsets with browsers that perform "charset detection" when the content-type is not specified. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Rajiv Aaron Manglani (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-05 04:11:42 UTC  ``` moderate: mod_status cross-site scripting CVE-2006-5752 Affects: 2.0.59, 2.0.58, 2.0.55, 2.0.54, 2.0.53, 2.0.52, 2.0.51, 2.0.50, 2.0.49, 2.0.48, 2.0.47, 2.0.46, 2.0.45, 2.0.44, 2.0.43, 2.0.42, 2.0.40, 2.0.39, 2.0.37, 2.0.36, 2.0.35 Fixed in Apache httpd 2.0.61-dev patched in apache-2.2.4-r12 or earlier   moderate: mod_cache proxy DoS CVE-2007-1863 Affects: 2.2.4, 2.2.3, 2.2.2, 2.2.0 Fixed in Apache httpd 2.2.6-dev patched in apache-2.2.4-r12 or earlier   didn't check the 2.0.x branch.    however apache-2.2.4-r12 need a patch for  moderate: mod_proxy crash CVE-2007-3847 A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy module. On sites where a reverse proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker could cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a malicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded Multi-Processing Module.  <http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_22.html>   ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-07 14:58:39 UTC  ``` there's also [bug 191603](show_bug.cgi?id=191603 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - www-servers/apache: Security-relevant updates"), and I have to admit I'm a bit lost with all this issues and versions. Apache, please advise on what needs to be done to fix this, and maybe close the other bug if it's not necessary. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Benedikt Böhm (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-07 21:47:56 UTC  ``` all CVEs have been backported to 2.0.59-r5/2.2.4-r12, except 2007-3847 is missing in 2.2.4-r12, but fixed with 2.2.6, which is now in cvs, see also #187258 ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-08 11:37:16 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 191603](show_bug.cgi?id=191603 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - www-servers/apache: Security-relevant updates") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-08 11:45:07 UTC  ``` ok thanks for the info. So in the end, how do you want to proceed with stabilization? In any case seems that we'll have to call arches for 2.2.6 as a fix is missing with 2.2.4-r12, but should we call all arches for 2.0.61 or just the ones that don't have 2.0.59-r5? please advise. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Benedikt Böhm (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-08 15:29:52 UTC  ``` 2.0.59-r5 is ok, but 2.2.6 should be stabilized asap for CVE-2007-3847 ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-08 15:39:15 UTC  ``` ok.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2013

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2013

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 128 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2013 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1525152.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=444414586251302&id=1525152.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=443859889660551&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

Oracle CVE-2013-2380 refers to the advisories that are applicable to JRockit from the Java SE Critical Patch Update. The CVSS score of this vulnerability CVE# reflects the highest among those fixed in JRockit. The complete list of all vulnerabilities addressed in JRockit under CVE-2013-2380 is as follows: CVE-2013-1537 and CVE-2013-2415.
2. Fixed in all supported releases and patchsets.
3. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). It does not have any particular associated protocol. If the hosting software passes data received over the network to Outside In Technology code, the CVSS Base Score would increase to 6.8.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
