Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-1733

**Vulnerable Software:** InterVetions' NaviCopa HTTP server 2.01

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a **buffer overflow** that occurs in the processing of HTTP GET requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The server does not properly validate the length of the input provided in the GET request, leading to a buffer overflow when excessively long strings are supplied.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the NaviCopa HTTP server. This could lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted GET request to the server. Specifically, the request can be targeted at /cgi-bin/ or /cgi/ paths, followed by a long string of characters (e.g., "A" repeated).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **No authentication required:** No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to send crafted HTTP GET requests.

**Technical Details:**
* The buffer overflow occurs when processing the path of the GET request.
* The location of the server's installation folder affects the overflow offset. For a default English Windows installation (Program Files/NaviCOPA), the EIP register is overwritten with characters 271-274 in the crafted request.
* Metasploit module available for exploitation, with target offsets for English and German Windows versions.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vendor was informed and released a patch with a very fast response time (2 hours).
*   The vulnerability is present in NaviCopa HTTP server version 2.01 (or earlier).
*   The vulnerability is not the same as the one described in BID 20250.
*  ASLR does not prevent reliable code execution
