# WordPress: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200703-23**

Wordpress contains several cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery
and information leak vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/wordpress** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.1.2** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

WordPress is a popular personal publishing platform with a web
interface.

### Description

WordPress contains cross-site scripting or cross-site scripting forgery
vulnerabilities reported by:

* g30rg3\_x in the "year"
  parameter of the wp\_title() function
* Alexander Concha in the
  "demo" parameter of wp-admin/admin.php
* Samenspender and Stefan
  Friedli in the "post" parameter of wp-admin/post.php and
  wp-admin/page.php, in the "cat\_ID" parameter of wp-admin/categories.php
  and in the "c" parameter of wp-admin/comment.php
* PsychoGun in
  the "file" parameter of wp-admin/templates.php

Additionally, WordPress prints the full PHP script paths in some error
messages.

### Impact

The cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be triggered to steal
browser session data or cookies. A remote attacker can entice a user to
browse to a specially crafted web page that can trigger the cross-site
request forgery vulnerability and perform arbitrary WordPress actions
with the permissions of the user. Additionally, the path disclosure
vulnerability could help an attacker to perform other attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all these
vulnerabilities.

### Resolution

Due to the numerous recently discovered vulnerabilities in WordPress,
this package has been masked in the portage tree. All WordPress users
are advised to unmerge it.

```

 # emerge --unmerge "www-apps/wordpress"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
