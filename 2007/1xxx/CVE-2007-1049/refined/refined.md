Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2007-1049:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the output of the `wp_explain_nonce()` function in WordPress. This function is used to display a confirmation message when performing certain actions that require a nonce (a security token). The output, which could include user-supplied input, was not being properly escaped before being included in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  By injecting malicious code into the input that gets passed into `wp_explain_nonce()`, an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript into the page. This could happen in the AYS (Are You Sure?) confirmation pages that use `wp_explain_nonce()`.
   - The code snippet from the changeset shows that the fix involved applying the `wp_specialchars` function to the output of `wp_explain_nonce()` before it is displayed in the HTML, which prevents the execution of injected code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Session Hijacking/Cookie Theft:** A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to steal a user's session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the user's WordPress account and performing actions on their behalf.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript to redirect users, deface the website, or perform other actions that could compromise the security of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through the `wp_explain_nonce()` function which is used in confirmation messages of actions.
- An attacker would need to find ways to inject malicious input into the data that is passed to `wp_explain_nonce()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious input into the arguments of the `wp_explain_nonce()` function. This could involve manipulating parameters in the URL or other input methods.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in WordPress user to visit the malicious link or perform an action that trigger the vulnerable code.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200703-23) confirms that this CVE is related to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in WordPress.
- The WordPress Trac tickets ([#3781](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3781), [changeset 4876](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4876), and [changeset 4877](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4877)) describe the vulnerability and the fix.
- The fix was to apply `wp_specialchars` to the output of `wp_explain_nonce()` to prevent the execution of injected code.
- The vulnerability was fixed in WordPress versions 2.0.9 and 2.1.1.
- The Secunia advisory linked in the Gentoo advisory (SA 24430) confirms that the `wp_explain_nonce` output needs to be escaped using `htmlspecialchars` to prevent XSS attacks.

In summary, CVE-2007-1049 refers to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in WordPress where the output of `wp_explain_nonce()` was not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious code via manipulated parameters. This vulnerability could lead to session hijacking and other malicious activity. The vulnerability was resolved by applying `wp_specialchars` to sanitize the output of the function.
