Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `SwDir.dll` ActiveX control (version 10.1.4.20) when handling overly large strings passed to several of its properties.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: Multiple methods in the `SwDir.dll` ActiveX control are vulnerable to stack overflows when processing excessively long string arguments. Specifically the properties `BGCOLOR`, `SRC`, `AutoStart`, `Sound`, `DrawLogo` and `DrawProgress`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The provided exploit code demonstrates a crash of the Internet Explorer process due to the stack overflow, leading to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious webpage containing embedded VBScript code that manipulates the `SwDir.dll` ActiveX control. The attacker could host this page on a website and entice users to visit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website.
- The attacker needs to trick users into visiting the website with the malicious code via Internet Explorer.
- The target system needs to have the vulnerable `SwDir.dll` ActiveX control installed.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit targets various properties of the Shockwave ActiveX control (`SwDir.dll`), demonstrating that multiple properties are vulnerable to the same buffer overflow.
- The provided code uses `String(1000000, "A")` to generate a very long string, triggering the overflow.
- The exploit was tested on Windows XP Professional SP2 with Internet Explorer 7.
