Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2007-1870:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A NULL pointer dereference occurs when lighttpd attempts to serve files with a modification time (mtime) of 0. The rendered string for mtime is cached, and the cache key defaults to 0. If a file has an mtime of 0, the pointer to the string is still NULL, and accessing it causes a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference
- Improper handling of file metadata (mtime specifically)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The server crashes due to the NULL pointer dereference.
- Remote attackers can cause the crash by uploading or manipulating the mtime of files.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: Attackers can trigger the vulnerability by requesting files with an mtime of 0.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to either upload files to the server or manipulate the modification time (mtime) of files on the server.
- The attacker needs to be able to make a request to the server for a file with a modification time of 0.
