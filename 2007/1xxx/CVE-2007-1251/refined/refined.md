Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-1251

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A format string vulnerability exists in the `new_warning()` function of the Netrek server.
- The vulnerability occurs because the `pmessage2()` function is called with user-controlled input (`temp`) as the format string, without proper sanitization or use of the format specifier.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:** The `vsprintf` function in `new_warning` uses user-controlled data as part of the format string. This enables an attacker to read from and possibly write to arbitrary memory locations on the server by embedding format specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%n`) within a crafted nickname.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploiting this format string vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to a full compromise of the Netrek server and connected clients.
- **Server Crash:** Malformed format strings could also lead to a crash of the server.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive memory regions of the server through format string reads.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote, In-game:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any player in the game by using a specially crafted nickname containing format specifiers.
- **Nickname Manipulation:** The attacker must set a malicious format string in their nickname which triggers `new_warning()` and `pmessage2()`.
- **Event logging enabled:**  The `EVENTLOG` switch must be enabled on the server to trigger the vulnerable code path. This is mentioned as non-default.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs to be a player in a Netrek game hosted by a vulnerable server.
-   The attacker needs to have the ability to set their nickname.
-   The server needs to have the `EVENTLOG` option enabled.

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerable function is `new_warning()` in `ntserv/warning.c`.
- The specific function call that leads to the vulnerability is `pmessage2(0, 0, from_str, me->p_no, temp);`
- A proof-of-concept exploit is available at http://aluigi.org/poc/netrekfs.zip.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Netrek server version 2.12.1.
