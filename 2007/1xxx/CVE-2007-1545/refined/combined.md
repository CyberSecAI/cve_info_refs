NAS History
Version 1.9.5 (stable) 1/29/2022
This is a maintenence release of NAS. There have been a few patches
submitted over the years (since 2013 - the relase of NAS 1.9.4)
fixing various compile issues and a buffer overflow in auphone. The
shortlog is below.
Anthony G. Basile (1):
On a uClibc system, the macro definitions of abs() and fabs()
cause the build to fail. Since these are specified by POSIX,
it is safe to just drop their definition. This has been
tested on uClibc, glibc and musl.
Jon Trulson (7):
Fix up some license issues.
Remove mention of title.ps from doc/README
Add a .gitignore file
AuErrDes.c: fclose file on return, fixes bug #6
dia: fix up some compiler warnings
auphone: use snprintf to avoid potential buffer overflow
Petr Písař (2):
Fix building with GCC 10
Unset LDFLAGS for config/configure
Pino Toscano (1):
Build the voxware server on Hurd
Version 1.9.4 (stable) 10/07/2013
- auerswald
- Fix several potential security issues in the NAS server reported
by Hamid Zamani  to the NAS mailing list.
See http://radscan.com/pipermail/nas/2013-August/001270.html for
a description. In addition, CVE numbers have been defined for
these issues:
CVE-2013-4256
CVE-2013-4257
CVE-2013-4258
- Fixed some warnings while building some of the clients.
- narrow a possible race condition in
auvoxware.c:disableProcessFlow() reported by Paul Fox.
- steve\_mcintyre
- add a format string to aulog.c (found using -Wformat-security
warnings)
- Don't preprocess man pages
- Add proper includes in server/os/connection.c to prevent some
compile warnings and a possible server coredump under the right
conditions on x86\_64 Linux systems.
Version 1.9.3 (stable) 05/13/2011
- overdue 1.9.3 maint release
- Older X11 systems used to define SharedLibX and friends if the
installed X11 system was built with shared lib support. Newer
X11's use SharedLibX11 instead. Same for
{Normal|Debug|Profile}LibX. So check for these and set
appropriately in NetAudio.tmpl.
Shared lib installations should deal with libXau dependancies
correctly now.
- auerswald:
Added MacOS X aka Darwin to list of systems that need to
explicitely link libaudio.so against libXau. This enables building
of the shared library libaudio.so on MacOS X.
There is currently no NAS server for MacOS X.
Version 1.9.2 (stable) 03/07/2009
- overdue 1.9.2 release.
- patch from Aleksey Cheusov:
"fix for "libpthread: Unlocking unlocked mutex" seen on NetBSD-4"
libaudio: OpenSvr.c: The server mutex was being unlocked, even
though it was never locked in the first place.
- Hugo Vanwoerkom reported thousands of diagnostics in his syslog:
"doSetup: elementRate == 0! Forcing to 5000". Fix doSetup to only
warn about this when the debug level is above 10.
- auerswald:
document syslog usage
use syslog if running as a daemon, stderr otherwise
add syslog-usage-change to HISTORY file
- steve\_mcintyre:
Minor man page fix ported from the Debian packages.
Multiple minor portability changes ported over from the Debian
packages. Cope with Hurd and GNU/KFreeBSD and other systems using
glibc
- apply patch from sourceforge user moinakg:
Libaudio is built with missing linker flags on OpenSolaris like
missing lXt, so it results in symbol not found errors at runtime.
I am including an Imakefile patch below that fixed this.
Version 1.9.1 (stable) 11/10/2007
- per a request from Frank Büttner (fedora maintainer), and in the
interest of providing the 'least surprise' for a user, nasd will
no longer initialize the mixer settings at start up, by default.
The default value of 'InitMixer' is now set to 'NO' in the
/etc/nasd/conf file.
See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=247468 for the
bug report.
- based on patch from Frank Büttner, nasd will create it's local
socket, and libaudio will look for it, in /var/run/nasd/audio\*.
on Linux systems. In reality, this should probably apply to all
'modern' unix systems (Solaris, \*BSD, etc), but only Linux is
affected by this change now.
See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=250453 for the bug
report.
The downside is that /var/run is not writable by normal users, so
if a user is trying to run the nasd server, s/he will get an error
about being unable to bind to the socket, and nasd will not start.
The workaround is to run nasd with the '-pn' (partial network)
option. This way, nasd will bind to a local TCP transport and
start successfully even if the local socket transport cannot be
initialized (though you will still see the error when nasd
starts).
Additionally, users on the local host trying to play sounds
through a server started this way may need to set their
AUDIOSERVER environment variable to 'localhost:0' for example,
rather than the default ':0' in order to play sounds.
Of course if nasd is started as root at system startup time, then
this is not a problem.
Version 1.9a (devel) 10/27/2007
- this is a possible 1.9.1 (stable) release in a couple weeks.
- modify intervalProc to stop/start the timer around AuProcessData()
calls, rather than simply disable the signal handler. This should
ensure that we never lose a timer signal, and seems to fix the
reported nasd hangs under newer linux kernels (2.6.21+).
The \*BSD folks should make sure everything still works, it
should...
- rework signal handling in the voxware (OSS) server. This also
allows DIA to block/unblock interrupts at he appropriate times
now.
- apply patch from Yarda that corrects a problem with blocking and
unblocking signals in IntervalProc() (auvoxware). [jet - this
patch was removed in the patches further up]
- remove mention of the auvoxware manpage from the filelist (for src
packaging), and remove the doc/html/auvoxware.1.html file.
- Apply patches from Erik Auerswald:
- the recent bug report from a fedora 7 user showed a small bug
with the input mixer code: If the input mixer cannot control the
input channels a wrong error message is printed. The attached
patch fixes this.
- remove auvoxware.man from the voxware Imakefile
- aupanel: add option -interval to synopsis section of man page
- add automatic querying of device attributes to aupanel with a
default query interval of 10 seconds
- make the nasd.conf man page formatting more consistent
- more cleanup and removal of old/useless files.
- remove useless nas.lsm file.
- sync up for copying repository to sourceforge.
- Patch from Stefan Huehner:
- remove SleepQueue functionality which is apparently not being
used anywhere.
- remove useless 'register' declarations
- convert Swap32Write for K&R to ANSI. Also, define it's buffer
pointer as AuUint32 rather than 'long', which was wrong, but
worked accidentally.
Version 1.9 (stable) 04/07/2007
- stable 1.9 release. No code changes (other than RELEASE) since
1.8b devel release.
- In short: Fixes to several DOS attacks that could be carried out
aginst a nasd server, ANSI'fication of most of the server and
client code, and significant rework of input and output mixer
handling in the voxware (OSS) server.
Read below for more detail on the changes since the last stable
release (1.8).
Version 1.8b (devel) 03/25/2007
- 1.8b devel release. Final 1.9 in about 2 weeks, barring any
catastrophes.
- fix a variety of problems that could result in a denial of
service by crashing the nasd server. These attacks were
researched by Luigi Auriemma, who also provided a description of
the attacks and an exploit program, 'nasbugs'.
I have added his emailed report and the test attack code to the
nas repository in contrib/nasbugs if you are interested. Thanks
to Luigi for finding these problems. It sucked fixing them :)
Here is a list of the bugs tested as output by the nasbugs
program:
1 = accept\_att\_local buffer overflow through USL connection
2 = server termination through unexistent ID in AddResource
3 = bcopy crash caused by integer overflow in ProcAuWriteElement
4 = invalid memory pointer caused by big num\_actions in ProcAuSetElements
5 = another invalid memory pointer caused by big num\_actions in
ProcAuSetElements
6 = invalid memory pointer in compileInputs
7 = exploits bug 3 in read mode (requires something playing on
the server)
8 = NULL pointer caused by too much connections
Note on bug #2, X11 display servers should be vulnerable to a
DOS of this type as well (causing fatal 'client not in use'
errors in AddResource()).
Note on bug #8, the nasd server will not be able to accept
further client connections when the client table is full, until
the rejected clients disconnect their end of the socket and the
neccessary fd's are freed up. It's better than coring though.
- set the default open modes for the output audio device to
write-only, and for the input device, use read-only (already the
default).
These can still be changed in the nasd.conf file, if needed.
Previously, the default was to open the output device
read-write, causing various issues with different
hardware/driver configurations. There is no need to open this
device read-write anyway.
- apply patch from Paul Fox, correcting a typo in auvoxware.c
- apply patch from Erik Auerswald
"With the attached patch the output and input device can be
disabled by specifying an empty string as device name. Yes, when
using an empty string for both devices there will be a NAS
server that can neither play nor record anything."
Version 1.8a (devel) 11/27/2006
- Updated the Amd.h (machine definition file) with modern X11
(X11R6.8) contents so it can build with Qt and other X11
software that makes use of X11's Xmd.h header file. Problem
reported by Bernard Leak.
- ANSI'fication of DeleteTypes (dia/resource.c) and NoopDDA.
Add proper header #includes where needed.
- patch from Petr Salinge (via Steve McIntyre) adding GNU/kFreeBSD
support.
- Patches from Paul Fox:
- allow the specification of a scaling factor to apply to the
output gain
- add a proper return value in auvoxware.c:initMixer()
- mondo indentification of server/\*
- Applied patches from Stefan Huehner:
- marks some read-only string and function parameters as 'const
char\*' instead of 'char \*'. In addition an unused buffer
'errfile' from aulog.c was removed. As the two release.h
files are generated the NetAudio.tmpl was modified to emit the
'const char \*' declaration.
- part two of the \_.\*Const removal patch. Some more defines of
\_.\*Const were removed which have been missed by the last patch
and the interval usage of \_.\*Const has been simplified to just
use const.
- removes more unused defines and functions in server/ .
Additionally a k&r style function was convertd to ansi c in
swaprep.c
- converts more function declarations and their prototypes
without parameters from () to the (void) form
- attached patch changes all of the conditional i.e. \_AuConst
definitions to only list const in the externally visible
header files. This is to preserve compatibility if someone
uses these definitions while using the libaudio library.
[JET] The use of AuConst is deprecated (and is probably not
being used by anyone anyway).
- removes the defined VENDOR\_STRING and VENDOR\_RELEASE from
server/include/site.h as they aren't used in the 3 files
including site.h. Additionally the inclusions of site.h was
removed from server/dia/main.c as none of its defines is used
in main.c
- removes the 2 unused functions:
- server/dia/dispatch.c: void UpdateCurrentTime()
- server/dia/dixutils.c: TimeStamp ClientTimeToServerTime
and it changes one more occurence of () to (void).
- corrects some function declarations by changing () to (void)
- removes some unsued variables in lib/audio/nameaddr.c and
and unused function in server/os/utils.c
- removed some old (and stupid) debug code for AIX: in
server/os/utils.c there is some code to redirect error logging
from stderr to and file in tmp on AIXV3. As OpenDebug isn't
called anywhere this is broken when AIXV3 is
defined. Additionally this logfile is fixed in /tmp which
permissions 00777
- removed the declaration of FreeResource from the opaque.h
header file. All files which include opaque.h don't use this
function and this declaration is copied from resource.h
- corrects several prototypes in resource.[ch] to match the
actual function definitions inside resource.c
- patch that modifies the two users of ostruct.h to directly
include os.h (which includes misc.h) and removes the
osstruct.h line in config/filelist. If an additional "svn
remove server/include/osstruct.h" is used we can get rid of
osstruct.h completely.
- removes servermd.h. removes the inclusion of servermd.h in 3
files and its reference in 'config/filelist'.
- clean up several of the client programs. Mostly adding const
to parameter/variable declarations. Additionally an unsused
variable was removed and some prototype in audemo.c were
fixed.
- remove some unused variables
- remove server/include/miscstruct.h
- various include file cleanups - removing unused
variables/structures, etc left over from X11.
- removing old 'const' determination, correcting some proper
uses of const. 'const' is expected to be supported by your
compiler.
- ANSIfication of various NAS components.
- remove unused portion of X11 server components (fonts, GC's,
etc).
- applied patches from Erik Auerswald:
- Add patch adding a proper 'reset' action to contrib/rc/nasd.
- a patch that:
Adds support for a different mixer for the input device to the
voxware server. Without this patch the mixer device specified
in the input section of the config file is not used.
To use the same mixer for input and output just specify the
same device in the input- and output-section of the config
file. The empty string "" can be used to specify no mixer
device for the input- or output-section. This is documented
in the nasd.conf man page.
The outputsection keyword is added to the nasd.conf man page.
fixed a bug in the support of two devices: If two devices are
used, and the sample rate of the input device can be changed,
the wrong sample size would be set by openDevice().
remove the unused "stereodevs" variable.
NOTE: Prior to this patch, the mixer device parameter for the
input section was completely ignored. The default value
for this ignored parameter was "/dev/mixer1".
With this patch, this parameter is honored. If your
configuration depends on the input mixer being the same
as the output mixer, you will need to edit your
/etc/nas/nasd.conf and set the mixer parameter in the
inputsection to '/dev/mixer', or to whatever mixer
device your outputsection is using.
If your system contains a /dev/mixer1 device (the
default input mixer device), nasd will now use it. This
is a good thing. :)
- preserve configuration of input device in the voxware server
when ReleaseDevice is on, and no flow is active.
- document nasd '-V' option in the man page
- opening the mixer device should be allowed to fail according
to http://radscan.com/nas/nas-ml/msg01121.html. But right now
it may only fail on startup, not when re-opening the audio
device. The attached patch corrects this issue.
- adding an option to aupanel to specify the initially
controlled device.
- keeping gain and input mode changes consistent between voxware
server and mixer if possible.
- changing recording level controls of the voxware server to use
IGain or RecLev when available and select only the specified
recording source.
- fixing MixerInit option of the voxware server.
- Adding a KeepMixer option (on by default) that causes NAS to
always keep the mixer device open so it can track external
changes to mixer settings.
- patch adding ReInitMixer option that init's the mixer to
defaults every time nasd re-opens the audio device.
- patches ANSI'fying the nas clients
- extending the gainScale functionality to apply to the input
gain as well.
Version 1.8 (stable) 06/03/2006
- time for another stable release.
- Correct problem in auvoxware, where if MixerInit is set to
false, remote volume (mixer) requests are ignored.
Reported by Paul Fox, with a fix determined by Steve
McIntyre and Erik Auerswald.
- Applied patch from Nicolas Escuder correcting a Cygwin
issue in auvoxware.c
- applied patch from Erik Auerswald adding a Mute button and
functionality to aupanel.
- applied patch from Nicolas Franois (via Steve McIntyre)
correcting some typos in the AuSetBucketAttributes and
AuSoundCreateFileFromBucket man pages.
- applied patch from 'Inma', correcting a connection hang in
Solaris 9. This reworks some of the very old and primitive
fd\_set stuff in Aulibint.c .
- updated config/config.sub and config.guess to properly
detect DragonFly systems.
- Applied patch from Mark Davies and Joerg Sonnenberger
correcting some BSD issues and adding DragonFly support.
The nasd.conf man page is always installed in
$FILEMANDIR for all systems.
- applied patch from Mark Davies correcting audio/Imakefile
to properly define BSD44SOCKETS on NetBSD systems.
- Applied patch from Steve McIntyre correcting CYWIN -> CYGWIN
typo in server/dda/voxware/auvoxware.c
- applied patch from Steve McIntyre Correcting some Gcc 4.0
and AMD64 issues.
Version 1.7 (stable) 11/14/2004
- 1.7 release :)
- fixed config/Imakefile so 'configure' command would work
under cygwin. Tested clients/server under cygwin.
10/06/2004
- 1.7 release candidate
- corrected a possible race condition in auvoxware that could
cause the server to hang under certain conditions. I do not
know why I haven't seen this problem before, but I could
recreate it easily by killing auplay while playing a long
tune.
If the system restarts syscalls after a signal handler has
run, a situation could arise where the previous timer was
never disabled. This could cause a previous ioctl(DSP\_SYNC)
called from setSampleRate() to be constantly interrupted and
restarted, causing an apparent hang.
Now we just turn off the timer as the first thing in
setSampleRate() so DSP\_SYNC can actually finish.
We also turn off the timer when openDevice is called, so the
'wait for device to become available' code can work too.
- Patch from Tobias Diedrich that allows mixer init to
fail in the voxware server.
Quote:
With this patch "aoss nasd" works, without it would fail
(aoss is the alsa oss wrapper script, which simply preloads
libaoss.so, a wrapper library similar to libaudiooss).
Combining this with the alsa dmix feature should allow nas
to coexist with other daemons like artsd.
See http://radscan.com/nas/nas-ml/msg01121.html for more
details.
- redid the FAQ in an attempt to make it more useful. I'll
try to keep it up to date.
- updated libtool due to a problem(s) reported by Steve
McIntyre.
08/20/2004
- clear CFLAGS before building config/config.h
- emit the release string to the log and stdout when
verbose is enabled.
- if '-V' specified, emit release string and stdout and exit.
- add a limit of 5 retries on failure to open input device.
- barring major problems, this is a release candidate.
06/20/2004
- add autoconf/configure support for config/. Now, during the
'includes' phase of the nas build, configure will try to
figure out some things about your system and build a
config.h file that the rest of nas can use. Prompted by
John Wehle's patch below.
NOTE: you still build nas like always with the imake
facility. configure in this case is only concerned with
locating various header files, functions, and the like.
- added FreeBSD 5.x patches from John Wehle correcting
malloc.h/stdlib.h use and other issues.
- remove ioctl(devAudio, AUDIO\_DRAIN, 0) call from
disableProcessFlow() in dda/sun/ausuni.c that seems to cause
problems (server hangs) with certain sun audio
hardware/kernel drivers.
- applied patch from James Lee correcting a coredump in
audemo.
- corrected problem with dia/auprocess.c that caused SIGFPE's
in nasd when an element with a samplerate of 0 was
processed. Thanks to Tobias Diedrich for a test case.
- removed some pre-R5 cruft from lib/audio/ConnSvr.c that
caused build problems on some solaris systems.
02/14/2004
- Fixed up some Cygwin issues... All of the clients and the
server seem to compile and work fine now. I tested both
local and remote, to and from unix and cygwin.
- Added patch from Steve McIntyre, adding a new '-config'
option to nasd. This allows you to start nasd with
alternate configuration files rather than the default of
/etc/nas/nasd.conf. Useful if you have multiple sound
devices.
- Added 64bit fixes from Per Oyvind Karlsen
12/31/2003
- corrected a coredump with the clients in 1.6a when using a
non-zero display number. GetAuthorization() was a bit
confused about the order of it's arguements...
12/24/2003
- preparing a long overdue development release
- ANSI'ification of libaudio.
There seemed to be some confusion with the order of
arguments to the AuSoundRecordToFile\*() functions.
The function declarations were made to match the prototype
definition and the man page.
- Modified Scott Presnell's patch to not enable BSD44SOCKETS
on Linux or SVR4 systems. There are some structure members
used that are not present on these (and perhaps other)
systems.
If you run into compilarion problems with ConnSvr.c relating
to invalid structure members, look at the define of
BSD44SOCKETS in Imakefile and correct for your system as
needed. Oh, send me the patch as well? :)
- auvoxware
- added some more useful debugging info. If you get the old
'cannot create audio block connection info" try running
nasd with '-v -d 99' and see what the real error is.
- certain ioctl() requests are no longer fatal (like
SOUND\_MIXER\_WRITE\_RECSRC and SOUND\_MIXER\_READ\_RECSRC).
Recording may not work properly if these fail though.
9/14/2003
- added patch from Marty Leisner cleaning up a couple of error
messages in server/os/connection.c
3/15/2003
- added a patch to the contrib section by Laurent Vivier - this
patch adds NAS support to the esound daemon on AIX systems.
Should be reasonably portable to other platforms as well.
Rumor has it that the Ximian folks are adding this support
officially into esound.
3/15/03
- set timer in auvoxware.c to trigger when 50% of the samples
are predicted to be consumed... This hopefully will help
with underruns on some systems/OS's... I'm not sure why
this is happening on those systems (it's not happened on any
of the systems I've used NAS on), so this should probably
be considered a harmless workaround.
3/4/03
- Patch from Scott Presnell to set BSD44SOCKETS properly for
libaudio.
12/11/2002
- patch from Steve McIntyre correcting a typo in Xtutil.h
Version 1.6 10/23/2002
- Release!
## 1.5h 10/12/2002
- Added SoundFileGetProc() to get access to the toSound and
fromSound procs in \_SoundFileInfo[]. Needed for xemacs.
- Added AudioLibraryVersionMajor, AudioLibraryVersionMinor,
and AudioLibraryVersionTeeny to audiolib.h. Somewhat more
informative than just the old AudioLibraryVersion which was
set at '2'.
The old AudioLibraryVersion define is still there however,
and is defined to be equal to AudioLibraryVersionMajor.
## 1.5g 10/7/2002
- changed inputsection defaults in nasd.conf.eg to 44.1Khz, 2
channel 16b sound.
outputsection also defaults to 44.1Khz now, instead of 33Khz.
- began some CC ANSI'fication of libaudio. So far only a
couple of files have been 'upgraded' just to see what the
implications are. It's going to be a bitch ;-) And there is
the likelyhood of introducing errors, so I'll get a stable
release out first before finishing this task. The result
however should be worth it. I've a feeling a few obscure
bugs will be found and fixed doing this.
- some cleanup in server/os/utils.c and server/include/os.h.
removing K&R style prototype decls, #including unistd.h, and
setting Xalloc() et. al. to use proper void \* rather than
unsigned longs.
- changed hardcoded '-L/usr/X11R6/lib' for REQUIRED libs in
lib/audio/Imakefile to '-L$(USRLIBDIR)'
- it doesn't have the HPUX 11 build fixes - I think I will
really need access to a machine, or someone who does have
access to one and wants to fix the build, in order to solve
this... The bcopy problem seems to be in the HPUX X11
config/ stuff.
- We really should release this one unless there are big
problems. ;-)
8/26/2002
- time for another development update. Should probably go
final with a 1.5.1 version soon...
7/23/2002
- removed fdset.h stuff for cygwin - no longer needed.
- auvoxware - added \_\_CYGWIN\_\_ checks (equal to linux)
- added \_\_CYGWIN\_\_ to dia/auservertype.h
- changed server imake to build nasd.exe on cygwin rather than nasd.
7/20/2002
- added cygwinArchitecture to the server Imakefile so
auvoxware will be built on cygwin systems.
- Removed the SoundFileInfo[] array in sound.h so cygwin would
be happy. Apps should not have been accessing that array
directly anyways.
Added the following new functions to sound.c (that used to
be macros in sound.h):
SoundFileFormatString, SoundValidDataFormat,
SoundFileFormatToString, SoundFileFormatToAbbrev,
SoundFileFormatToSuffixes
Assuming your code did not attempt to directly access
SoundFileInfo[], no changes should be required.
libaudio.so revision bumped to 2.3
7/15/2002
- patch from Nicholas Wourms.
- fixed FIONREAD in Alibint.c for cygwin
- fixed Imake for libaudio on cygwin
7/9/2002
- rename dia/nasconfig.\* to dia/nasconf.\* to avoid name
collision with NasConfig.h on windows systems.
## 1.5e 7/7/2002
- added patch from Nicolas Escuder that adds support for
Windows operating systems using Cygwin. Even the NAS server
is now supported. There are still issues with the clients.
I will provide a link on the nas-links page to precompiled
windows binaries for libaudio.dll, nasd, and some clients -
provided by Nicolas.
- based on idea from Nicolas, added background (-b) mode to
nasd, to force it to run in the background. Actually, he
supplied a patch, but I just redid it to work properly with unix
systems.
If you want to see error messages from nasd while starting
up, do not run it in daemon mode or you won't see the error
messages as stdout/stderr are closed. Someday, I'll track
down all of these and have them use osLogMsg(), which would
work regardless.
- added NAS\_AUDIOMSGFILE in config/NasConfig.h to specify
where audio messages are stored (ADMPATH in os/osinit.c).
- Yes, we are at 1.5e now. Sorry I didn't release 1.5b-d. Was
a little busy with the day job ;-)
## 1.5d 6/1/2002
- added .ps -> .pdf conversions in doc/pdf/
- added html versions of man pages in doc/html/
## 1.5b 3/16/2002
- added patch from Marco Molteni to add a '-local' option to
nasd. Specifying this option allows only local clients to
connect.
- fix nasd.man to describe this and other supported options.
- moved allow\_any\_host into the NasConfig struct. Along with
the new '-local' option.
## 1.5a 2/23/2002
- more STARTSERVER fixes - there was still one case where when
STARTSERVER was defined, nasd could be called with the wrong
display number due to a bug in \_AuConnectServer.
- changed LEX/YACC DEBUG token to CDEBUG to avoid conflicts
when building nas with '-DDEBUG'
- DEFAULT\_AUSERVER is now ":0" rather than
"tcp/localhost:8000". A local socket connection will startup
faster than a tcp connection.
- mutex.h
- corrected unixware 7.x build problem
(XMUTEX\_INITIALIZER) in mutex.h
- added same check for sun/solaris boxes
- got rid of XUSE\_MTSAFE\_API - now controlled by
NAS\_USEMTSAFEAPI defined in config/NasConfig.h
If you think you are having mutex problems, you can
edit config/NasConfig.h and '#undef'
NAS\_USEMTSAFEAPI, then rebuild everthing. This will
turn off threadsafety in libaudio.
- added patch from Tobias Diedrich to fix deadlock in
AuNextEvent().
- added new mutex in audio/Alibint.c to protect
\_AuReadEvents() since it can no longer rely on the server
lock as a result of Tobias's patch above.
- added new option, 'gain', to config file in the input/output
sections. This sets the default gains when nasd starts up
(if MixerInit is enabled). Only in voxware for now.
1/5/2002
added -lXt and -lXau to the lib dependancy for libaudio.so on
Linux systems per a request from Lorenzo Delana.
1/20/2002
- fixed bug in ConnSvr.c that could cause the wrong server
number to passed to nasd when STARTSERVER is defined.
Version 1.5 12/26/2001
## 12/1/2001
- Corrected manpage html generation issue with the nasd.conf
manpage via patch from Erik Inge Bolso
## 1.4.2d 11/25/2001
- implemented locking in libaudio via Xthread mutexes.
This is kind of a big change, but the result should be a
threadsafe libaudio. I used Xthreads, because then
theoretically I shouldn't have to care about the system's
actual thread implementation. Right?? I've tested so far on
Linux (uses pthread\_\*) and Unixware 2.03 (uses thr\_\*). So
far so good.
- bumped up the libaudio rev to 2.2
## 1.4.2c 11/4/2001
- turned off streams support on SVR4 systems for libaudio.
UNIX and TCPCONN work just fine. The nasd server hasn't
used streams support since the 1.3 timeframe anyway. This
will work around local connection issues on UnixWare and
probably Intel Solaris as well.
- added patches from Steve McIntyre to work around an XFree86
issue, and prevent the HPUX server from being built on HPPA
systems running Linux.
- add change to AuServerName() in libaudio to default to
'tcp/localhost:8000' if neither AUDIOSERVER or DISPLAY are
set as per a suggestion by Erik Inge Bolso.
## 1.4.2b 10/6/2001
- Added patches from Peter Berg Larsen to the Sun server that
adds support for $AUDIODEV on Sun Ray platforms.
- Added patches from Peter Berg Larsen that corrects some
issues dealing with dead clients, and improper server resets
when persistent flows are still active. Also, some
uninitialized variables are now properly initialized.
## 1.4.2a 4/21/2001
- patch from Steve McIntyre to resolve man page issues, and
add a libm dependancy to libaudio for linux platforms.
- patches from Philippe Jouguet
new options in nasd.conf for the voxware server:
- add 'mixer' device option to secify the mixer.
- add 'forcerate' option to force the sample rate
to the current rate at all times
- add 'autoOpen' option to specify whether the audio
devices are opened at init time.
- add 'readwrite' option to specify whether devices
are opened read/write (default) or
readonly/writeonly for the input and output devices,
respectivly.
- added patch from Nick Ing-Simmons to pass the correct port
offset when starting nasd within libaudio (if START\_SERVER
is defined at build time).
- always output verbose/debugging info to stderr if debugging
is enabled (even if you normally use syslog). stderr is not
closed when debugging is turned on.
Version 1.4.2 4/8/2001:
## 1.4.1b 3/9/2001
- added patch from Paul Fox allowing auctl to set gains based
in an increment
- added a patch to lib/audio/wave.c from Philippe Jouguet that
corrects an infinite loop that can occur when auplay is fed
a corrupted wave file.
- added patches to auplay from Paul Fox. auplay will now stop
the flow when a signal is caught. Also a new option '-l'
allows auplay to play filenames specified on stdin.
- set libaudio's SO revision to 2.1 from 1.4 to avoid
confusion with older apps built when the older libaudio
was at 2.0 (debian).
## 1.4.1a 12/10/2000
- autool - fixed -volume option
- added cast from a patch by Sun Ireland for their OpenOffice
(StarOffice) project.
- fixed libaudio to start up 'nasd' instead of 'au' when
START\_SERVER is defined.
- applied Erik Inge Bolso's patch for properly opening 2
channels instead of 3 for stereo output devices.
- added HPUX 10.20.x patches from Klaus Dittrich
- fixed problem in lib/audio/Alibint.c regarding ambiguous
casts with void pointers in the buffer padding code, and to
make it more portable with other operating systems/compilers
(HPUX 10.20, UW7).
- lib/audio/soundlib.c - fixed cases where a client (like
auplay) would hang if the element Import size matched the
complete datasize of a flow. An EOF would never be sent.
Thanks to Shigeharu Takeno for providing a reproducible test
case.
- added Unixware 7.1 patches from Robert Roselius.
- added patch to sun/ausuni.c from John Wehle correcting a
problem on some solaris machines that don't allow sbpro
devices to be open for both reading and writing.
- add patches from Steve McIntyre for creating sticky socket
directories, and to close stdin, stdout, and stderr.
Version 1.4.1 9/4/2000:
- this release is really only neccessary if you are using the
NAS server on a Sun, and have frequent dropouts.
- fix to the sun server from Charles Levert correcting a Sun
problem with 'late SIGPOLLS'.
- minor documentation fixes - new mailing list archive
location, etc.
Version 1.4 2/27/2000:
- Release of 1.4
- Removes USE\_BSD\* dependancies on Linux builds.
## 1.3e 02/12/2000:
- This is a pre-release 1.4 candidate.
- corrected a problem in the voxware server where when
ReleaseDevice was enabled, the device would be held
open when nasd was first started until the first
connection was made.
- added config/NetAudio.def to set various configurables like
NasConfigSearchPath.
- changed documentation regarding the new location of the web
site (http://radscan.com/nas.html)
## 1.3d 01/05/2000:
- corrected some build problems on Sparc Solaris 2.6 with native
compiler/X11 env
- corrected build problems on native Unixware compiler and X11R5
Note, to get this to work, you need 3 corrected
/usr/X/lib/config/ files from me...
- integrated config handling in all servers, based on a
lex/yacc parser from Stephen Hocking that was in the
voxware server.
- config file is /etc/nas/nasd.conf
an example config file (/etc/nas/nasd.conf.eg)
is installed.
- parser errors are a bit more informative ;-)
- no more parser in voxware server... moved into dia/
for general purpose use.
- each server now has a config.c and config.h file that
provides the ddaSetConfig() functionality required
of each server by dia/. In the SGI case,
it's just a stub. ddaSetConfig() ignores options
it doesn't understand (required behavior).
- server cmdline options '-v' (verbose) and '-d '
(debug messages) added. These override
nasd.conf settings.
- hooks added to all servers in config.c - ddaProcessArg()
and ddaUseMsg() for integrated arg handling.
- voxware server:
- release device functionality now controlled by
nasd.conf
- mixer init policy now controlled by nasd.conf
- sun server:
- added integrated sun (ausuni) module (now built by
default) into the distribution.
- release device functionality now controlled by
nasd.conf
- hpux server:
- added device release (ReleaseDevice) capability to hpux
server. All servers except for sgi now
support this functionality.
- fixed sample rate change problem in hpux server
- separated hardware init code for ReleaseDevice
functionality
- added new option in nasd.conf to select either the
EXT (external - headphones/speakers) or INT
(internal speaker) output device by default
- renamed generated server binary from au\* to nasd for all
servers
- man pages updated (auserver.man and
AUVoxConfig.man respectively).
## 1.3c 10/24/99:
- Added patches from Mark Davies for NetBSD.
- changed BIG\_ENDIAN ->NAS\_BIG\_ENDIAN and LITTLE\_ENDIAN to
NAS\_LITTLE\_ENDIAN per Mark's suggestion globally
- Added global NasConfig struct for configurables global to all
servers.
- More prep work for unified arg/config handling
- Some bug fixed related to the 'mondo' patch.
- Replacement of PRMSG() macros with a varargs logging function:
osLogMsg(...). If your working on a server and want to
use these, #include "aulog.h" (in 1.3c+) and go for it.
- I've added a NasConfig.h file to config/ that defines (or will)
a few things (like whether you want to use syslog,
etc). Initially you will need to tweak this manually
for your site...
- Changes made to the way various include files are generated
during a build... Basically any module that contains
header files needed by other modules have the
appropriate header files exported into TOPLEV/include
during the includes phase of the build using the imake
BuildIncludes() macros.
## 1.3b 9/4/1999:
- Addition of Steve McIntyre's Mondo patch.
## 1.3a 8/1/1999:
- First test version incorporating many patches from around
the planet, based on original 1.2p5 sources.

o fixed some HP server compilation problems.
o fix a potential problem when reading from a client. under
some circumstances the read pointer could be left on
a non-sample size boundry resulting in white noise.
o add a bit to the component use field to indicate that using
that component will override the use of other components. This
bit is used on input devices when the audio hardware does not support recording and playing simultaneously.
o fix a problem with limiting samples on waveform devices. if you
used anything other than AuUnlimitedSamples, bad things would
happen.
Library
o fixed a problem reading some wave files.
Clients
o auphone - check for the exclusive use bit.
o auscope - display the exclusive use bit.
Misc
o support library and client compilation under Windows NT with
X11R6.1.

Bill Sebok)
o added AuSoundRecordToDataLength() which can be used to find the
length of data recorded when recording to memory.
(Thanks to Jonathan Thompson)

\*\* 1.2 - PATCH 02 \*\*
Server
o caused the server to return to the lowest sampling rate when a
flow terminates while playing multiple flows simultaneously.
o improved voxware dda driver.
(Thanks to Stephen Hocking and Shawn M.)
o experimental HP dda driver. (Thanks to William J. Hunter)
o add a -timeout option to the server to allow the server to
terminate after a period of time with no clients.
(Thanks to William L. Sebok)
To enable this, you must build the NAS tree using the following:
make WORLDOPTS='-k CDEBUGFLAGS="$(CDEBUGFLAGS) -DSTARTSERVER"' World
Library
o fixed a bug in the wave file reader.
o fixed a bug in the aiff file reader.
o new soundlib/sound functions AuSoundPlay(), AuSoundRecord(),
and SoundTellFile() with man pages. (Thanks to Yoav Eilat)

cannot initially connect to a local server.
(Thanks to William L. Sebok)
To enable this, you must build the NAS tree using the following:
make WORLDOPTS='-k CDEBUGFLAGS="$(CDEBUGFLAGS) -DSTARTSERVER"' World
Clients
o add \*input resources to all X clients to correct a problem
with some window managers not giving focus.
o fixed bug in auscope when displaying actions or parameters.
o fixed typo in auscope that caused it not to work with Perl 5.
o added playRaw example client.
\*\* 1.2 - PATCH 01 \*\*
Server
o added output mode control (Speaker/Headphone/Line-Out) to the server
and the Sun dda drivers. (thanks to Ian Donaldson)
o fix for multiple bundle elements in a flow. (thanks to Steven King)
o improved voxware dda driver.
(thanks to Christian Schlichtherle and Stephen Hocking)
o the server now does a range check on the output data and
clips correctly. Due to the possible performance impact,
this can be disabled by commenting out the #define
OUTPUT\_RANGE\_CHECK in server/dia/auprocess.c. \*\* ATTENTION
DDA DEVELOPERS \*\* this fix required a change to all of the
dda drivers. The output minibufs must be twice as large as
they were previously. (thanks to Steven King)
o voxware dda driver - Fix problem (apparently from
SoundPlayFromBucket) where tail of data was not flushed
through card until start of next operation. (Thanks to Paul
F. Werkowski)
o only call dda set sample rate callback if the rate has changed.
Library
o SVR3.2 with STREAMSCONN wouldn't work with XDMCP due to a
bug in nameserver.c. (required XDMCP to be disabled; this
won't affect users of stock NAS 1.2 but would affect those
audio servers that implement XDMCP authorization checking)
(thanks to Ian Donaldson)
o fatal errors now lookup AuErrorDB for more detail.
(like Xlib does with XErrorDB) (thanks to Ian Donaldson)
o Implementation of user callable error catching functions:
AuSetErrorHandler()
AuSetIOErrorHandler()
(thanks to Ian Donaldson)
o added default error handler variables so you can catch errors
during the initial server open. (Thanks to Richard Caley)
o added some setjmp gunkus to Xtutil.c for use by error handlers.
(Thanks to Richard Caley)
o C++ compatibility. (Thanks to Yoav Eilat)
o New SoundSeekFile() and SoundFlushFile() functions.
(Thanks to Yoav Eilat)
o SoundNumSamples() value is now updated in SoundWriteFile().
(Thanks to Yoav Eilat)
Clients
o added re-written auscope.
o modified aupanel to support output mode controls.
General
o made all the Imakefiles use an explicit path for NetAudio.tmpl
to fix possible includes of the wrong NetAudio.tmpl.
o some notes on building under SunOS 4.1.3 OpenWindows from
Ian Donaldson.
o new API man pages from Steven King. (Thanks!)
o made man page installation use standard InstallManPage macro.
o use AuInstallScript macro to install scripts.
o fixed some build and install problems under FreeBSD 1.1.5.1.
(Thanks to Paul F. Werkowski)
\*\* Release 1.2 \*\*
General
o A few cosmetic changes.
\*\* PATCH 02 \*\*
Server
o fixed a bug with monitor elements not returning the correct
data. This caused the meters in audemo to be broken.
o patches from Steven King
- In server/os/connections.c, EstablishNewConnections
probably ought to check that newconn is less than
lastfdesc before it is used in the BITSET macro (this in
the mit X11r5 source, havent looked at r6 yet), tho
you'd need lots and lots of connections to tickle
this. Also in connections.c, CheckConnections should
probably check for EINTR if select returns an error, I
dont know if any implementation of select would actually
EINTR for if it got a SIGPOLL or SIGALRM if the timeout
is zero, but better safe than sorry.
- FallbackDefineSelf exists and is only referenced in
os/access.c. Its part of the localconn patch which
obviously isnt handling non 386 svr4's correctly.
Library
o fixed a bug in AuSoundRecordToData(). The flow wasn't getting
stopped when the recording was finished.
o fixed compile problem in ConnSvr.c under Dell 2.2 Xfree86-2.1.1.
o fixed compile problems under some X11R4s that don't define \_Xconst.
Clients
o fixed problem with audial -recognize messing with line mode and
gain attributes without checking to see if the device was capable.
o fixed range/clipping problem in effectsAmplitude in auedit.
General
o changed occurances of the name "NetAudio" to "Network Audio System"
or "NAS" due to a name conflict.
o patches from Ian Donaldson
- Solaris 2 server failed to link because of undefined
symbol FallbackDefineSelf().
- Shared library compilation broke completely due to
changes in NetAudio.tmpl and because the include of
 was moved too high up in
lib/audio/Imakefile, and missed out on the
DoSharedLib/DoNormalLib flags etc.
\*\* PATCH 01 \*\*
Server
o fixed a couple of problems with speed changes in the
SVR4 VOXware driver.
\*\* Release 1.2b BETA \*\*
Library
o fixed possible bogus free in sound.c.
Clients
o fixed auwave dropping core (due to bugs in the slider widget).
General
o lots of stuff from Steven King. See CHANGES.sk below for details.
o The file server/PATCHES.sk contains patches from Steven King to
improve the handling of audio clipping in the server. I've
not applied them to the standard distribution yet because
I'm concerned about their possible performance impact.
o added some documentation about actions.
\*\* PATCH 01 \*\*
Server
o fixed a bug with looping flows.
Library
o fixed problem with X11R4 build.
\*\* Release 1.2a ALPHA \*\*
Server
o fixed a bug in ReadElement that would occasionally cause
protocol errors during recording.
o wake up the server when there are events to send out.
o fixed a bug in readBucket() that caused noise at the end of
a bucket.
o get rid of minibuf padding to eliminate clicks.
o optimized sample rate conversion.
o added FreeBSD/Linux VOXware driver (thanks to Amancio Hasty).
o added SVR4 VOXware driver (thanks to Stephen Hocking).
o added line mode control to Sun dbri driver.
Library
o add AuXtAppRemoveAudioHandler().
o fixed memory leaks and other problems with the bucket attribute
cache.
o fix some nits with waveform durations.
Clients
o new auphone sample app.
o added some simple examples.
General
o much cleaning and various OS support fixes from
Ian M. Donaldson. See CHANGES.labtam below for details.
\*\* Release ?.? ALPHA (Feburary 11, 1994) \*\*
Server
o fixed a bug where the last little bit of audio data would be
lost.
o fixed a bug in readClient where the buffer was being incorrectly
padded, possibly resulting in static at the end of the audio data.
o fixed two track monitor elements.
o Sun driver
- fixed a bug that could cause the output to get jumbled.
- wait for audio to drain after flows finish.
- Sparc 10 dbri driver.
Library
o added API for set and get close down mode.
o added Amiga IFF/8SVX sound file support.
o close the sound file before the callback is called for
AuSoundRecordToFile().

\*\* Release 1.1 \*\*
Server
o Protected malloc/free from audio signals.
o Fixed setting parameters of waveforms and buckets.
o New dia/dda interface.
o Fixed a bug where the flow was re-compiled after
an event was requested even if that event didn't change
the state of the flow.
o Fixed possible memory trashing in readClient.
o Sun driver
- Don't initialize output gain or internal/external speaker
mode.
- Get rid of some 'clicks'.
- Deal with the situation when there are no physical outputs
in a flow. This fixes the core dumps when you record before
having played anything.
- Fixed erroneous calling of AuProcessData() after changing
gain values.
- Fixed various bugs in recording (how did it ever work?!)
o New SGI driver (thanks to Reiner Ernst)
Library

Many thanks to Ian M. Donaldson at Labtam for the following:
- Now compiles cleanly on all these without any compiler warnings
whatsoever (well the odd one or two under X11R4).
- Solaris 2.3 on SS1000 under Sun provided Open Windows 3.2
Server untested.
(We only have a SS1000 running 2.3 which has no audio device)
Porting required because Sun changed the audio interface
slightly in Solaris 2 versus SunOS 4.
Clients tested reasonably.
- AIX 3.2 on a RS6000/220 under IBM provided X11R4
No server port done. Don't have access to any IBM audio hardware.
Clients tested reasonably.
- SunOS 4.1.2 on a Sun IPX under MIT provided X11R5.
(no porting required specific to this platform)
Both clients and server tested reasonably.
- SVR4.0/486 on one of our own computers under MIT provided X11R5.
(as a guess comparable to Dell SVR4.0 or ESIX SVR4.0)
We used native STREAMSCONN TLI TCP/IP transport.
No server port done. This computer never had audio hardware.
Clients tested reasonably.
- SVR3.2/486 on one of our own computers under MIT provided X11R4.
This O/S uses Lachman provided TCP/IP, and we used
STREAMSCONN TLI TCP/IP transport.
No server port done. This computer never had audio hardware.
Clients tested reasonably.
Unfortuantely every SVR3.2 system has some different
quirk since TCP was non-standard then. No guarantees
it will compile better on other types.
- Bugfixes
- server had byte swapping error that crashed playbucket(1)
when client run from opposite endian host
- autool crashed on little endian host when volume slider was
used when stopped (hung on big endian host)
- various signal mis-use. Background processes from non-job
control shells don't die when ^C hit anymore.
- "SVR4" is not a reliable symbol for use in Imakefiles; use SystemV4
instead. (broke audial).
- in Netaudio.tmpl, don't redefine MKDIRHIER or BINDIR by
default as this breaks the bootstrap in subtle ways on
certain systems. Audio clients now get installed in the
same directory that X clients do rather than /usr/local/bin.
On Solaris 2.3 with OpenWindows, this means /usr/openwin/bin,
otherwise it usually means /usr/bin/X11.
Similarly for header files, app-defaults and libraries.
- build will not fail on systems that don't have servers ported
to them. This allows the clients and libraries to be built
on all platforms and servers on a subset.
- libaudio is built as a shared library (currently rev 2.0) on systems
where libX11 is built shared. In the list above that means
Solaris 2.3, SunOS 4.1, SVR4.0.
I used rev 1.0 for the September 93 netaudio release but changes
between then and netaudio 1.1 looked somewhat incompatable so I bumped
the revision number then.
- X11R4 compatability re-added in so compiliation in those
environments is now possible.
- STREAMSCONN support for SVR3.2 and SVR4.0 for libaudio.
This is a direct port from MIT X11R5 with the odd fix-tracker applied.
NB: Not done for auscope(1). sockets used in that case.
(this is ok but if people want binary compatability from SVR3.2
to SVR4 sockets won't work because SVR3.2 has no standard socket ABI)
- Better System-V and SVR4 support
- Use System-V reliable signals. (ie: sigset(2)).
signal(2) is unreliable on System-V systems.
Didn't bother with SVR4/POSIX signals; SVR3 signals work
fine on SVR4 and are easier to understand and code.
- don't use libucb at all on SVR4. This library is bad news
on most SVR4 systems and should be avoided like the plague!
- Better ANSI support (SVR4 + Solaris)
- use ANSI memcpy/memset exclusively on ANSI systems instead
of bcopy/bzero
- eliminated all SVR4.0/486 cc's reported warnings of callback
function type declaration mismatches. (this is the bulk
of the changes). Solaris 2 cc doesn't report half these things
unfortunately.
- auscope(1) now has a '-n' flag so it can be run in background reliably.
- 'make install' now fully installs correctly. Even app-defaults!
- 'make clean' now properly cleans

Thanks to Steven King for the following:
- building on ISC
I had a few problems building 1.2a on my system running ISC SVR3.2r4.0
with the imake enviroment provided by XFree86 (It looks to be more
work than its worth to get netaudio to build with the vendor supplied
X11R4).
In server/dia/au.h, ISC doesnt have memmove, however bcopy and friends
are in the normal library search path.
In lib/audio/Alibnet.h, the omission of the #define for \_AuWriteV
resulted in link errors for all clients.
In lib/audio/Imakefile, the SYSV\_DEFINES macro causes major grief if
one has installed XFree, I would expect this to be true for any SVR32
that has XFree. Also, I found it usefull to include NetAudio.tmpl
after Library.tmp so that I could redefine things like CDEBUGFLAGS and
such in NetAudio.tmpl
In clients/audio/audemo/audemo.c, ISC needed sys/time.h included, I
suspect most SYSV's will as well.
In clients/audio/audial/audial.c, the compile breaks on the inclusion
of sys/file.h, I think this is a ISC 4.0 specific problem.
- localconn patches
These patches are derived from the XFree86 2.0 release. I pretty much
just merged the XFree patches into netaudio. My principle interest
was in the streams localconn code for ISC; besides greatly improving
the performance for local clients, they allow the server to run with
the system at run level 2, or on systems where full networking isnt
availible (an extra $$$ option on ISC and lots of other PC sysVs).
In addition to the ISC code, theres also support for other systems, SVR4,
SCO, linux and net/free bsd, which may or may not be usefull depending
on the system (ie, is anyone doing an independent SCO port?). There
is also alot of code for a minix and amoeba port. I can pretty much
guarantee that this will not work, but I left it in as it doesnt affect
the other systems and might give a leg up to anyone attempting a minix
or amoeba port.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

1) Introduction
2) Bugs
3) The Code
4) Fix
#######################################################################
===============
1) Introduction
===============
Network Audio System (NAS), as suggested by the name, is a network
transparent audio system which works very similarly to the X server.
The server daemon runs as root and listens on both Unix and TCP
sockets.
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
----------------------------------------------------------
A] accept\_att\_local buffer overflow through USL connection
----------------------------------------------------------
A stack based buffer-overflow is located in the function which receives
the connection over the USL socket allowing the writing of 255 bytes in
the path buffer of 64.
Note that this socket is not enabled by default and I don't know in
what occasions or on what platforms it runs.
from server/os/connection.c:
static int
accept\_att\_local(void)
{
int newconn;
int read\_in;
char length;
char path[64];
/\*
\* first get device-name
\*/
if ((read\_in = read(ptsFd, &length, 1)) <= 0) {
Error("audio server: Can't read slave name length from USL client connection");
return (-1);
}
if ((read\_in = read(ptsFd, path, length)) <= 0) {
Error("audio server: Can't read slave name from USL client connection");
return (-1);
}
path[length] = '\0';
...
----------------------------------------------------------
B] server termination through unexistent ID in AddResource
----------------------------------------------------------
An unexistent client ID forces the termination of the server.
from server/dia/resource.c:
Bool
AddResource(AuID id, RESTYPE type, pointer value)
{
int client;
register ClientResourceRec \*rrec;
register ResourcePtr res, \*head;
client = CLIENT\_ID(id);
rrec = &clientTable[client];
if (!rrec->buckets) {
ErrorF("AddResource(%x, %x, %x), client=%d \n",
id, type, (unsigned long) value, client);
FatalError("client not in use\n");
}
...
---------------------------------------------------------------
C] bcopy crash caused by integer overflow in ProcAuWriteElement
---------------------------------------------------------------
An integer overflow in ProcAuWriteElement allows the crash of the NAS
server through a too long max\_samples value set by the client during
the connection and the subsequent writing of too much bytes in the
destination buffer.
In my tests wasn't possible to cause damages worst than a crash since
it's not possible to control the amount of bytes to write.
from server/dia/audispatch.c:
int
ProcAuWriteElement(ClientPtr client)
{
...
if (stuff->num\_bytes > c->dataSize - currentSize)
AU\_ERROR(AuBadValue, stuff->num\_bytes);
if (stuff->num\_bytes) {
s = (AuUint8 \*) & stuff[1];
d = c->write;
n = aumin(stuff->num\_bytes, c->dataEnd - d);
bcopy(s, d, n);
/\* wrap if necessary \*/
if (n != stuff->num\_bytes)
bcopy(s + n, c->data, stuff->num\_bytes - n);
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
D] invalid memory pointer through big num\_actions in ProcAuSetElements
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In ProcAuSetElements num\_actions is used for incrementing the pointer
of the el structure which is located in the stuff buffer (the buffer
containing the data of the client).
If a client sends one or more big num\_action values will force the
server to use (through el) the data outside the stuff buffer causing a
crash.
from server/dia/audispatch.c:
#define ADD\_VAR(n) \
{ \
AuUint8 \*\_t = (AuUint8 \*) el; \
\
varLen += (n); \
\_t += (n); \
el = (auElement \*) \_t; \
}
#define COMP\_ACTIONS(num) \
{ \
numActions += (num) ? (num) : numDefaultActions[el->type]; \
ADD\_VAR((num) \* sizeof(auElementAction)); \
}
...
int
ProcAuSetElements(ClientPtr client)
{
fprintf(stderr, "XXX ProcAuSetElements\n");
REQUEST(auSetElementsReq);
FlowPtr flow;
int len, i, varLen, numActions, status;
auElement \*el;
...
el = (auElement \*) & stuff[1];
/\* compute length of variable data and do some error checking \*/
for (i = varLen = numActions = 0; i < stuff->numElements; i++, el++)
switch (el->type) {
case AuElementTypeImportClient:
COMP\_ACTIONS(el->importclient.actions.num\_actions);
...
------------------------------------------
E] invalid memory pointer in compileInputs
------------------------------------------
Another crash is possible through an invalid memory pointer caused by
the AuCompileFlow function using a too big input value (then passed to
compileInputs as inputNum).
from server/dia/auutil.c:
static int
compileInputs(ClientPtr client, FlowElementPtr elements,
CompiledFlowOutputPtr output, AuUint32 inputNum,
AuFixedPoint multiplyConstant, AuFixedPoint addConstant,
AuUint8 numTracks, AuUint8 \* inTracks, AuUint8 firstOutTrack,
AuBool recompile, AuUint32 \* inputCnt)
{
auElement \*el = elements[inputNum].raw;
int status = AuSuccess;
AuBool compiled = elements[inputNum].compiled, compileInput = AuFalse;
AuUint32 nextInput;
AuUint8 inputTracks[auMaxTracks];
/\* XXX - need to check for loops \*/
/\* indicate that we've compiled this element \*/
elements[inputNum].compiled = AuTrue;
...
----------------------------------------------
F] NULL pointer caused by too much connections
----------------------------------------------
A NULL pointer crash can be exploited very easily and without any type
of authentication from both local and remote sockets through many
simultaneous connections (at least 120).
from server/os/io.c:
int
ReadRequestFromClient(client)
ClientPtr client;
{
OsCommPtr oc = (OsCommPtr) client->osPrivate;
register ConnectionInputPtr oci = oc->input;
...

# NAS: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200704-20**

The Network Audio System is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could
result in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/nas** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.8b** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.8b** |

### Background

NAS is a network transparent, client/server audio transport system.

### Description

Luigi Auriemma has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in NAS, some of
which include a buffer overflow in the function accept\_att\_local(), an
integer overflow in the function ProcAuWriteElement(), and a null
pointer error in the function ReadRequestFromClient().

### Impact

An attacker having access to the NAS daemon could send an overly long
slave name to the server, leading to the execution of arbitrary code
with root privileges. A remote attacker could also send a specially
crafted packet containing an invalid client ID, which would crash the
server and result in a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All NAS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/nas-1.8b"
```

BugTraq ID     : 23017
Debian Bug     : 416038

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in nas, the Network Audio
System.

CVE-2007-1543

A stack-based buffer overflow in the accept_att_local function in
server/os/connection.c in nas allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a long path slave name in a USL socket connection.

CVE-2007-1544

Integer overflow in the ProcAuWriteElement function in
server/dia/audispatch.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a large
max_samples value.

CVE-2007-1545

The AddResource function in server/dia/resource.c allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (server crash) via a
nonexistent client ID.

CVE-2007-1546

Array index error allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(crash) via (1) large num_action values in the ProcAuSetElements
function in server/dia/audispatch.c or (2) a large inputNum parameter
to the compileInputs function in server/dia/auutil.c.

CVE-2007-1547

The ReadRequestFromClient function in server/os/io.c allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via multiple
simultaneous connections, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.

For the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7-2sarge1

For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) and the unstable
distribution (sid) these packages have been fixed in version 1.8-4.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
