Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-1112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the presence of unsafe methods within the ActiveX controls of Kaspersky Anti-Virus. Specifically, the `AXKLPROD60Lib.KAV60Info` and `AXKLSYSINFOLib.SysInfo` ActiveX controls, found in `AxKLProd60.dll` and `AxKLSysInfo.dll` respectively, expose methods that can be abused.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The following methods of the ActiveX controls are vulnerable:
*   `DeleteFile(ByVal strFileName As String)`: Allows arbitrary file deletion.
*   `StartBatchUploading(ByVal arrFiles As Variant , ByVal strFTPAddress As String , ByVal strFTPUploadPath As String)`: Allows uploading of arbitrary files to an attacker-controlled FTP server.
*   `StartStrBatchUploading(ByVal strFiles As String , ByVal strFTPAddress As String , ByVal strFTPUploadPath As String)`: Allows uploading of arbitrary files to an attacker-controlled FTP server.
*   `StartUploading(ByVal strFilePath As String , ByVal strFTPAddress As String , ByVal strFTPUploadPath As String)`: Allows uploading of an arbitrary file to an attacker-controlled FTP server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote attackers to:
*   **Delete arbitrary files** on the vulnerable system.
*   **Upload arbitrary files** from the vulnerable system to a remote FTP server controlled by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through a malicious web page.  A user must visit this malicious web page, which leverages the vulnerable ActiveX controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to host a malicious web page.
*   The attacker needs to convince the user to visit this page (social engineering).
*   The attacker needs to have access to a server where files can be uploaded using FTP.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability requires user interaction.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection against this vulnerability via Digital Vaccine filters (IDs '5061', '5062').
*   The vulnerability was reported to Kaspersky on 2007-01-08, and a coordinated public release of the advisory happened on 2007-04-05.
