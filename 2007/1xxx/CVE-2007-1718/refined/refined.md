  "CVE-2007-1718": {
    "description": "A flaw was discovered in the way PHP's mail() function processed header data. If a script sent mail using a Subject header containing a string from an untrusted source, a remote attacker could send bulk e-mail to unintended recipients.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The mail() function in PHP does not correctly escape control characters in multi-line email headers.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "CRLF injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary email headers, potentially leading to the sending of bulk e-mail to unintended recipients.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote",
        "HTTP request header",
        "Unsanitized user-supplied input via a script's mail() function"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the subject field of the mail being sent by the vulnerable php script. This could happen if the php application did not properly sanitize the input before including it in the mail subject."

       "affected_packages": [
        "php5", "php4"
