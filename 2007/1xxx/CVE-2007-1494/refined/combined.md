### [Baby Formula: HiPP Brand History](baby-formula-hipp-brand-history.html)

The history of the Hipp brand dates back to 1898, when Josef the hippy confectioner from Güntsburg had a daughter and then twins a year later. And all would be well, but Joseph's wife began to have problems with breast milk, the woman was clearly not able to feed all their children. So Josef decided to make the formula himself. He baked dry cookies, ground them up and prepared a special mixture based on cow's milk. To his delight, the children were satisfied with its taste. Even today, Hipp is one of the most famous baby food brands in the world. It sells a wide range of various products for the nutrition of children of different age categories.

### [Maybe He Just Likes You by Barbara Dee ~ #MeToo](2019/06/maybe-he-just-likes-you-by-barbara-dee.html)

Introducing a new title for middle
graders that I thought might be of interest to most of my readers

***Maybe He Just Likes You***by
Barbara Dee

Barbara Dee explores the subject of #MeToo for the middle grade
audience in this heart-wrenching—and ultimately uplifting—novel about
experiencing harassment and unwanted attention from classmates.

For seventh-grader Mila, it starts with some boys giving her an
unwanted hug on the school blacktop. A few days later, at recess, one of the
boys (and fellow trumpet player) Callum tells Mila it’s his birthday, and asks
her for a “birthday hug.” He’s just being friendly, isn’t he? And how can she
say no? But Callum’s hug lasts a few seconds too long, and feels…weird.
According to her friend, Zara, Mila is being immature and overreacting. Doesn’t
she know what flirting looks like?

But the boys don’t leave Mila alone. On the bus. In the halls.
During band practice—the one place Mila could always escape.

It doesn’t feel like flirting—so what is it? Thanks to a chance
meeting, Mila begins to find

### [Hailee by Penny Zeller ~ another amazing review](2019/05/hailee-by-penny-zeller-another-amazing.html)

**Hailee by Penny Zeller**

**Montanna Skies Series #3**

[![](https://www.nukescripts.net/3bp/-uFw2w2s-Tfg/UDvlHzeYylI/AAAAAAAAC3Y/8hIOkf-X4t0/s320/hailee+penny+zeller.jpg)](https://www.nukescripts.net/3bp/-uFw2w2s-Tfg/UDvlHzeYylI/AAAAAAAAC3Y/8hIOkf-X4t0/s1600/hailee%2Bpenny%2Bzeller.jpg)

At twenty years of age, Nathaniel Maxwell Adams Jr., better known as Nate, fulfills a prophecy he made eleven years prior by moving to Pine Haven. What he hadn't planned in his youth, though, was to become a pastor, especially since his parents adamantly oppose the idea. So, as he shepherds a flock in the growing Montana town, he feels called to another smaller yet no less significant mission field: his mother and father.

For years, orphan Hailee Annigan was just a ragamuffin, roaming the Cincinnati streets trying to keep food in the mouths of her two younger brothers and herself. This often meant thieving, which landed her in the Sanctuary of Hope, a home for delinquent youngsters. There, her life changed, thanks to her patient, loving teachers. Now, at eighteen, she pursues a dream to become a teacher herself and bravely accepts a position in Montana. She still has faith that she'll find her brothers again someday, but for now, she's ready to put the past behind her.

When their paths converge in Pine Haven, their lives begin to overlap in ways they can't ignore. And they must discover if God intends for their destinies to converge, as well.

**(spoilers ahead. . . . )**

I was  drawn to the main character Hailee from the beginning of the book.  Her story of love and sacrifice for her younger brothers endeared her to me right away.  I was captivated

**I found this post that I had put on my blog a few years ago.  Summer Break is coming fast and I have only a few outings planned for the kiddos.  I want to keep them busy, yet still give them time for carefree fun.**

**I am interested in ideas!  What do you do with your kiddos during breaks from school when you are not gone on vacation?  I do have some chores for them but also want some fun ideas that are low-cost to entertain them and also stimulate their minds.   Here is what happened in the previous post . . . . . .**

**The Bride Wore Blue**

**Headed toward a fresh start but tethered by her past, Vivian longs to break free, to find forgiveness and love.**

At last, the sisters are reunited! The youngest Sinclair, the family“ baby”, is moving from Maine to Cripple Creek, Colorado and joining Kat, Nell, and Ida. But Vivian is a young woman with a will of her own, and made some decisions back in Portland that have begun to haunt her. Will she be able to live up to the expectations of her three perfect and now happily-settled sisters?

The sisters warmly welcome Vivian to the mountain west, but the wild-and-woolly mining town isn’t ripe with opportunities for a respectable young woman. The youngest Sinclair sister is determined to make her own way, so when she’s offered a job as a
