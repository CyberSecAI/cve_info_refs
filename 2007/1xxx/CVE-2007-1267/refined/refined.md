      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to how GnuPG handles signed messages in streaming mode, specifically when additional data is inserted before or after the signed content, which is not correctly identified by naive usage of gpg.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper handling of concatenated data with signed messages",
          "Lack of proper status interface usage to verify signed messages"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can forge a signed message by prefixing it with arbitrary material, potentially misleading users into believing that the additional text is also covered by the signature.",
        "attackVectors": [
          "Manipulating a pipeline or redirected input and output of gpg.",
          "Inserting additional data before or after a signed OpenPGP message."
        ],
        "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input data to gpg or gpg2, for example, through a pipeline or file concatenation, and must be able to create a valid OpenPGP signature or have access to one."
      },
      "additionalNotes": "This advisory provides significant detail about the vulnerability, including how to exploit it and how GnuPG 1.4.7 and GPGME 1.1.4 address it, and provides patches for older versions."
