Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1687:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to buffer overflows in the Internet Pictures Corporation iPIX Image Well ActiveX controls. These controls are provided by the `iPIX-ImageWell-ipix.dll` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflows:** Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist within the iPIX Image Well ActiveX controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit these buffer overflows to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious content.
*   **Application Crash:** Exploitation can also cause the application using the ActiveX control (e.g., Internet Explorer or the WebBrowser control) to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTML Document:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML document, which could be a web page, an HTML email message, or an email attachment.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to view the specially crafted HTML document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely and without needing to authenticate to the system.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious HTML document to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor, Internet Pictures Corporation, appears to be out of business, and no patch is available.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the affected ActiveX controls by setting the kill bit in Internet Explorer.
*   Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone can also prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities.
