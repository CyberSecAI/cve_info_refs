RELATED: CVE-2007-1510
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the 'post.php' script. Specifically, the 'postid' parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
SQL Injection vulnerability exists. The 'postid' parameter in 'post.php' is vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of proper sanitization.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information like usernames and passwords from the 'pbl_users' table, or other database manipulation.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is via HTTP GET request to the 'post.php' script, by manipulating the 'postid' parameter. For example, by providing a crafted SQL injection payload.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable 'post.php' script. No authentication or special privileges are needed.
