Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-1899:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization when handling user-supplied data within the myBloggie application. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries into the application's database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where specially crafted inputs are used to modify database queries.
* **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** In one of the provided examples, the SQL injection is combined with XSS to further impact the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially obtain sensitive data stored in the database, including usernames and passwords.
* **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify data within the database.
* **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker could potentially gain administrator privileges by exploiting the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Direct SQL Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL or form input that, when processed by the vulnerable application, results in execution of attacker-controlled SQL code.
    - This is demonstrated in the first example where a crafted `user_id` parameter is used.
* **Indirect SQL Injection via XSS:** The attacker creates a malicious HTML page that, when viewed by an administrator, automatically submits a form containing malicious SQL code to the application, exploiting both SQL Injection and XSS.
    - This is shown in the second example, where the malicious page automatically submits a form containing the SQL injection code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable myBloggie instance.
* **PHP Configuration:** Successful exploitation requires specific PHP configurations: `magic_quotes_gpc` must be set to `Off` and `register_globals` must be set to `On`.
* **User Interaction (for combined XSS attack):** The combined SQL injection and XSS attack requires an administrator to visit a malicious webpage.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability affects myBloggie version 2.1.6.
* The vendor was notified but did not respond.
* A workaround is provided to disable `register_globals` or enable `magic_quotes_gpc` in php.ini.
