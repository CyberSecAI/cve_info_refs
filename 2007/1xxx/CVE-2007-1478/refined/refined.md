```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The McGallery 0.5b application's `download.php` script is vulnerable to arbitrary file download.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unvalidated user input in the filename parameter of the `download.php` script allows for arbitrary file retrieval from the server.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can access sensitive files on the server by manipulating the filename parameter.
- Attack vectors:  A malicious user can craft a URL with a specific filename parameter to download any file accessible by the web server.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the affected server.
