{
  "CVE-2007-1215": {
    "Description": "A local elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Graphics Device Interface due to the way it processes color-related parameters. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to take complete control of the system.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way GDI processes color-related parameters, specifically when an application passes these parameters to an unchecked memory buffer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of color parameters in GDI.",
      "Lack of proper bounds checking on the memory buffer within GDI."
     ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to log on to the system.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to execute code locally on the target system. The vulnerability is exploited by running a specially crafted program that renders affected image types."
