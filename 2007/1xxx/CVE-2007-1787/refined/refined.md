Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-1787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an insecure file inclusion in the `lib/timesheet.class.php` file of Softerra Time-Assistant. The script uses the `include()` function with parameters `inc_dir` and `lib_dir` without properly sanitizing the input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary remote files. The lack of input validation on the `inc_dir` parameter allows an attacker to specify a URL pointing to a malicious script, which is then executed by the vulnerable application.
- **`register_globals` dependency:** The exploit relies on `register_globals` being enabled on the PHP server. If this setting is disabled, the vulnerability would not be exploitable in the same manner, though other attack vectors might exist.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Access:** Successful exploitation could lead to system access, as the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file. This can lead to complete compromise of the server and the data it hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attack is triggered via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `lib/timesheet.class.php`, with a malicious URL provided in the `inc_dir` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be a remote user on the network.
- **Basic web request knowledge:**  The attacker needs to be able to construct HTTP GET requests and host a malicious PHP file on a publicly accessible webserver.

**Summary of vulnerability details:**
The vulnerability is in the `lib/timesheet.class.php` file where the application uses the `include()` function with unsanitized `inc_dir` and `lib_dir` parameters. This allows a remote attacker to include arbitrary remote files by manipulating the `inc_dir` parameter. Successful exploitation gives the attacker system access by executing malicious code on the server. This requires `register_globals` to be enabled for this specific exploit vector.
