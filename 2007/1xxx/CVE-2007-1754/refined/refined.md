  "CVE-2007-1754": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Publisher does not adequately clear out memory resources when writing application data from disk to memory. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Publisher (.pub) page. When a user views the .pub page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.",
    "Root cause": "Publisher does not correctly validate memory values read from a malformed file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory management"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote Code Execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could make changes to the system with the permissions of the logged-on user. If a user is logged in with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "E-mail: sending a specially crafted .pub file to the user.",
      "Web-based: hosting a webpage that contains a specially crafted .pub file. Attackers would need to convince the user to visit the website."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create a specially crafted Microsoft Publisher file (.pub) and deliver it to a user."
