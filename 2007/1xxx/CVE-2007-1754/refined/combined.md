### Vulnerability Information

## Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers

| Affected Software | Publisher Invalid Memory Reference Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1754 | Aggregate Severity Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Office Publisher 2007 | **Important**Remote Code Execution | **Important** |

## Publisher Invalid Memory Reference Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1754

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Publisher does not adequately clear out memory resources when writing application data from disk to memory. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Publisher (.pub) page. When a user views the .pub page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-1754](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-1754).

#### Mitigating Factors for Publisher Invalid Memory Reference Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1754

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability In addition, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content, or compromised Web sites and advertisement servers could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* 2007 Microsoft Office System will show a prompt with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document from the Internet or restricted sites zone.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for Publisher Invalid Memory Reference Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1754

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
* Modify Access Control List on pubconv.dll

  To modify the Access Control List (ACL) on pubconv.dll to be more restrictive, follow these steps:

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type "cmd" (without the quotation marks), and then click **OK**.
2. Type the following command at a command prompt. Make a note of the current ACLs that are on the file (including inheritance settings) for future reference in case you have to undo this modification:

   **cacls \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\pubconv.dll**
3. Type the following command at a command prompt to deny the âeveryoneâ group access to this file:

   **cacls \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12 /d everyone**

   **Impact of Workaround:** Applications that require the use of previous editions of Publisher documents may no longer function correctly.

#### FAQ for Publisher Invalid Memory Reference Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1754

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

If successfully exploited, this remote code execution vulnerability could allow the attacker to run arbitrary code as the logged-on user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Publisher does not correctly validate memory values read from a malformed file.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could make changes to the system with the permissions of the logged-on user. If a user is logged in with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Publisher file with an affected version of Microsoft Office Publisher.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Publisher file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Microsoft Publisher is used are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by correctly validating memory values read from a file.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

Wir zeigen, wie sich falsche von echten Meldungen unterscheiden lassen und beschreiben am Beispiel von Google Chrome, wie Push-Nachrichten deaktiviert werden kÃ¶nnen.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
