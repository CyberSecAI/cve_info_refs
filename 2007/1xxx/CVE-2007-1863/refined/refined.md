{
  "CVE-2007-1863": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mod_cache` module in Apache HTTP Server does not properly sanitize the value of cache control headers (s-maxage, max-age, min-fresh, max-stale) before processing it.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A missing check or improper validation on the value of the Cache-Control headers.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can send a crafted request that, when processed by the Apache server's `mod_cache` module, causes the Apache child process to crash. This leads to denial of service, especially when using a threaded Multi-Processing Module (MPM).",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with malformed Cache-Control header.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker is remote and capable of sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
    },
  {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of validation on the value of s-maxage, max-age, and min-fresh Cache-Control headers, causing a segmentation fault.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient input validation. Improper handling of missing values in Cache-Control headers.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can crash the Apache child process, resulting in a denial of service. The vulnerability is more easily exploitable when using a threaded MPM.",
       "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a malicious HTTP request including the Cache-Control header. The values for s-maxage, max-age or min-fresh are intentionally set without an assigned value (e.g., `s-maxage:`)",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability."
