        "Root cause": "A denial of service bug exists in the way vixie-cron verifies crontab file integrity.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Vixie-cron incorrectly verifies crontab file integrity, specifically checking if the file's hard link count (st_nlink) is equal to 1. If not, cron will not execute those files.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "A local user can create a hard link to `/etc/crontab` (or files under `/etc/cron.d/` or `/var/spool/cron/crontabs`) which will prevent vixie-cron from executing certain system cron jobs or user's cron jobs. This results in a denial of service.",

          "Information": {
        "Root cause": "A flaw in vixie-cron allows a local user to create a hardlink to /etc/crontab, causing cron to stop executing the /etc/crontab file.",
          "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The vulnerability lies in the way vixie-cron checks for hardlinks on its configuration files. It expects `st_nlink` to be 1. If it is not, cron will not execute files.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "By creating a hardlink, the cron service will stop executing `/etc/crontab` and deposit an error message in `/var/log/cron`, thus denying service for scheduled tasks.",
        "Attack vectors": "A local user creates a hardlink to `/etc/crontab`.",

        "Root cause": "Vixie-cron checks the `st_nlink` count of crontab files, and if it's not equal to 1, cron will not execute them.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "Vixie-cron has weak permissions set, which allows local users to create hard links to system and users' cron files. The `st_nlink` check results in an error and prevents the file's execution.",
