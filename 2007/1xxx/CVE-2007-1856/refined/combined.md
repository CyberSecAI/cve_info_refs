How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0345)

## Topic

Updated vixie-cron packages that fix a denial of service issue are now
available.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The vixie-cron package contains the Vixie version of cron. Cron is a
standard UNIX daemon that runs specified programs at scheduled times.

Raphael Marichez discovered a denial of service bug in the way vixie-cron
verifies crontab file integrity. A local user with the ability to create a
hardlink to /etc/crontab can prevent vixie-cron from executing certain
system cron jobs. (CVE-2007-1856)

All users of vixie-cron should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=235880#c0)  Josh Bressers    2007-04-10 16:43:23 UTC  ``` Raphael Marichez of Gentoo reported a denial of service flaw in vixie-cron.  By creating a hardlink to /etc/crontab, cron will stop executing the /etc/crontab file and deposit an error message in /var/log/cron.  This can be easily tested by running: ln /etc/crontab /tmp/crontab tail -f /var/log/cron   Here is the patch from Open Wall Linux: <http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/Owl/packages/vixie-cron/vixie-cron-4.1.20060426-owl-st_nlink.diff?rev=1.1;content-type=text%2Fplain>  This flaw also affects RHEL 3 and 4.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=235880#c5)  RHEL Program Management    2007-04-23 14:23:36 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux maintenance release.  Product Management has requested further review of this request by Red Hat Engineering, for potential inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Update release for currently deployed products.  This request is not yet committed for inclusion in an Update release.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=235880#c6)  Steve Grubb    2007-04-24 18:32:31 UTC  ``` vixie-cron-4.1-68 was built to solve this issue.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=235880#c19)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-05-17 14:26:06 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0345.html>    ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2007:0345 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: vixie-cron security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0345)

## Topic

Updated vixie-cron packages that fix a denial of service issue are now
available.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The vixie-cron package contains the Vixie version of cron. Cron is a
standard UNIX daemon that runs specified programs at scheduled times.

Raphael Marichez discovered a denial of service bug in the way vixie-cron
verifies crontab file integrity. A local user with the ability to create a
hardlink to /etc/crontab can prevent vixie-cron from executing certain
system cron jobs. (CVE-2007-1856)

All users of vixie-cron should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

| [Description](#c0)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-01-29 21:10:51 UTC  ``` Hi,  i may have found a problem in some implementations of cron. vixie-cron and fcron are concerned, dcron is not; i haven't checked other ones.  cron checks if the crontab files have st_nlink==1, and if not, cron doesn't execute those files.  If /home is not on a separate partition, i can : ln /etc/crontab . (then wait for a reload, or force a reload with crontab -e) and the cron service is nearly entirely shut down (/etc/cron.daily|monthy|hourly)  i can also ln /etc/cron.d/* to deny the execution of those files  finally if i am in the crontab group, i can cd /var/tmp (which is usually rwrwrw), and "ln /var/spool/cron/crontabs/user ." I force a cron reload with a quick "crontab -e"  Jan 29 21:16:01 localhost cron[6014]: (*system*) BAD LINK COUNT (/etc/cron.d/test) Jan 29 21:11:01 localhost cron[6014]: (*system*) BAD LINK COUNT (/etc/crontab) Jan 29 21:11:01 localhost cron[6014]: (falco) BAD LINK COUNT (crontabs/falco)  Debian has the same behaviour, but the access to /var/spool/cron/crontabs is more restricted. Jan 29 22:09:01 djali /usr/sbin/cron[10918]: (x2002marichez) WRONG INODE INFO (crontabs/x2002marichez)     i restrict this bug today, but it may be useful to get some feedback from several developers. This check is probably here for some reason...! ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-01-30 19:53:46 UTC  ``` Aaron, Wolfram, do you have an idea on why does this st_nlink check exist? Do you have any comment? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Wolfram Schlich (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-01-30 22:58:26 UTC  ``` FCron (2 and 3) only seems to check link count for temporary files. Thus, it does not seem to be affected. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-02-06 12:13:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=164466#c2)) > FCron (2 and 3) only seems to check link count for temporary files. > Thus, it does not seem to be affected. >   Right, thanks.  But vixie-cron doesn't deal with that kind of temporary files. It really checks st_nlinks on the real crontabs.  Vapier do you have any clue here? I'm still looking for a possible reason why does vixie-cron check st_links==1 on its crontabs, allowing for a local DoS throught hardlinks created on /etc/crontab /etc/cron.*/* /var/spool...etc   ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2007-02-16 06:40:06 UTC  ``` i cant guess; seems like a dumb check ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-02-27 00:00:36 UTC  ``` so i'd tend to ask to Wolfram if he wants to patch that and fix it.

vixie-cron security update (RHSA-2007-0345)

Original Release Date: June 19, 2007

Last Revised: February 19, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-261

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The vixie-cron package contains the Vixie version of cron. Cron is a
standard UNIX daemon that runs specified programs at scheduled
times.

A denial of service(DoS) bug was found in the way vixie-cron
verifies crontab file integrity. A local user with the ability to create
a
hardlink to /etc/crontab can prevent vixie-cron from executing certain
system cron jobs. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2007-1856](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1856) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0345.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with vixie-cron installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 2.x, 3.x, 4.x | Low | Customers should upgrade to CM 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | Customers should upgrade to IALX 2.0 SP2 or later. |
| Avaya EMMC | All | Low | Will not be addressed since no further releases of EMMC are planned. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 4.0 and earlier | Low | Customers should upgrade to MSS 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | All | Low | Customers should upgrade to SES 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya AES | AES 3.1.3, 4.01, 4.1 | Low | Customers running AES 3.1.3 should upgrade to AES 3.1.4 or later. Customers running AES 4.01 or 4.1 should upgrade to AES 4.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable versions of
vixie-cron, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVLAN | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite(IMS) | All | None | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
Avaya recommends that customers follow
recommended actions supplied by RedHat Linux or remove the affected
package.

# Vixie Cron: Denial of service — GLSA **200704-11**

The Gentoo implementation of Vixie Cron is vulnerable to a local Denial of
Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-process/vixie-cron** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.1-r10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.1-r10** |

### Background

Vixie Cron is a command scheduler with extended syntax over cron.

### Description

During an internal audit, Raphael Marichez of the Gentoo Linux Security
Team found that Vixie Cron has weak permissions set on Gentoo, allowing
for a local user to create hard links to system and users cron files,
while a st\_nlink check in database.c will generate a superfluous error.

### Impact

Depending on the partitioning scheme and the "cron" group membership, a
malicious local user can create hard links to system or users cron
files that will trigger the st\_link safety check and prevent the
targeted cron file from being run from the next restart or database
reload.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Vixie Cron users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-process/vixie-cron-4.1-r10"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
