How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* **001: SECURITY FIX: March 25, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  A race condition has been reported to exist in the handling by sendmail of
  asynchronous signals. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running sendmail, typically root. This is the second revision of
  this patch.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/001_sendmail.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: May 2, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server --
    [CVE-2006-1526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526).
    Clients authorized to connect to the X server are able to crash it and to execute
    malicious code within the X server.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/002_xorg.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2006**
        *All architectures*

      A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
      message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
      This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
      delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
      delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
      malformed MIME message exists.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/003_sendmail2.patch)

      * **004: SECURITY FIX: July 30, 2006**
          *All architectures*

        [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/httpd.8)'s
        mod\_rewrite has a potentially exploitable off-by-one buffer overflow.
        The buffer overflow may result in a vulnerability which, in combination
        with certain types of Rewrite rules in the web server configuration files,
        could be triggered remotely. The default install is not affected by the
        buffer overflow. CVE-2006-3747

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/004_httpd.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A message
          with really long header lines could trigger a use-after-free bug causing
          sendmail to crash.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/005_sendmail3.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            Due to an off-by-one error in
            [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/dhcpd.8),
            it is possible to cause
            [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/dhcpd.8)
            to exit by sending a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32-byte client identifier option.
            [CVE-2006-3122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3122)

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/006_dhcpd.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                *All architectures*

              It is possible to cause the kernel to panic when more than the default number of
              semaphores have been allocated.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/007_sem.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                  *All architectures*

                          Several problems have been found in OpenSSL. While parsing certain invalid ASN.1
                          structures an error condition is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite
                          loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function. A NULL
                          pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
                          applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
                          public keys being used.

Log message:
m_dup1() copies the packet header and allocates the mbuf cluster in the
wrong order. M_DUP_PKTHDR needs to be called with an empty mbuf.
Allocating an mbuf cluster beforehand is not allowed as the resulting mbuf is
no longer considered empty (part of the header is initialized).
The correct order is to allocate an mbuf via MGETHDR(), copy the packet header
and as last step allocate the cluster.

* **001: SECURITY FIX: November 4, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/httpd.8)
  does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when it is
  reflected back in an error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS)
  style attacks.
  [CVE-2006-3918](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3918)

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/001_httpd.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: November 4, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    Several problems have been found in OpenSSL. While parsing certain invalid ASN.1
    structures an error condition is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite
    loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function. A NULL
    pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
    applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
    public keys being used.

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 7, 2006**
          *All architectures*

        Due to a bug in the
        [arc(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/arc.4)
        RAID driver the driver will not properly synchronize the cache to the logical volumes
        upon system shut down. The result being that the mounted file systems within the logical
        volumes will not be properly marked as being clean and fsck will be run for the subsequent
        boot up.

## OpenBSD IPv6 kernel buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#986425

Original Release Date: 2007-03-15 | Last Revised: 2007-05-03

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the OpenBSD kernel could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system or cause the system to crash.

### Description

| The [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/) kernel contains a flaw in its handling of kernel memory buffers when processing IPv6 packets. This flaw results in a memory corruption vulnerability that allows a remote attacker with the ability to send fragmented ICMPv6 packets to trigger an overflow of mbuf kernel memory structures. The original reporters of this vulnerability, Core Security Technologies, have published a detailed analysis of this vulnerability in [CoreLabs Advisory CORE-2007-0219](http://www.coresecurity.com/index.php5?module=ContentMod&action=item&id=1703).  Systems connected to public IPv6 networks are particularly at risk from this vulnerability. However, since link-local addresses are part of the IPv6 specification and configured by default on Ethernet interfaces, even systems that have not been explicitly configured to use public IPv6 networks are vulnerable to attack from other systems on the same physical network or multicast network.Note that we are aware of working, publicly available exploit code for this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to supply a specially crafted fragmented IPv6 packet may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system or cause the system to crash. The attacker-supplied code would be executed in the context of the kernel. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from the vendor**The OpenBSD development team has published patches to address this issue. Please see the System Affected section of this document for more information.Note that a second revision of the patch was released after the initial publication of this document. Users should be sure to obtain this second revision of the patch. |
| --- |

| **Filter IPv6 packets**Sites, particularly those who are unable to apply the patch, are encouraged to filter IPv6 traffic to affected hosts. For the OpenBSD packet filter, [pf(4)](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf&sektion=4), use "block in inet6" in /etc/pf.conf. |
