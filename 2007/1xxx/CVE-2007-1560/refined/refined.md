{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Squid incorrectly handles TRACE requests with a \"Max-Forwards\" header field set to \"0\" in the `clientProcessRequest()` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of HTTP TRACE method requests",
      "Improper input validation of Max-Forwards header"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted TRACE request, which terminates the Squid child process. Repeated attacks can render the service unavailable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending crafted HTTP TRACE requests with a \"Max-Forwards: 0\" header."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Squid proxy server.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in all Squid 2.6 versions up to and including 2.6.STABLE11. It was fixed in version 2.6.STABLE12. A workaround is to deny access to the TRACE method via ACLs. The vulnerability can be triggered by any client trusted to use the service."
