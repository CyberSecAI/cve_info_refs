  "CVE-2007-1255": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Connectix Boards 0.7, including privilege escalation and code execution.",
     "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `p_skin` parameter within the user profile settings and a file upload vulnerability in the admin interface",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL injection via the `p_skin` parameter: A malicious user can manipulate the `p_skin` parameter during profile updates, injecting arbitrary SQL code.  The application's failure to properly sanitize this parameter allows for the modification of user data in the database.",
       "Unrestricted file upload: A vulnerable file upload routine allows a user to upload a crafted GIF image containing PHP code which is later executed when accessed.",
         "Insecure cookie handling: The application stores session information in cookies which may be vulnerable to manipulation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve privilege escalation by modifying the user's class to admin.  They can also gain arbitrary code execution by uploading and executing malicious PHP scripts, potentially compromising the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests to the user profile update page to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.",
       "HTTP request to the admin interface to upload a malicious file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a registered user to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability in profile settings.  The attacker needs valid admin credentials to access the file upload functionality, or a prior exploit to elevate their privileges."
