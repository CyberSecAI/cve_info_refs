Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-1484:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a double-free error within the `array_user_key_compare()` function. This function is used internally by PHP, for example, in `uksort()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Double-free vulnerability: The function attempts to free the same memory location twice, which can lead to memory corruption.
- Unallocated memory access: Before the double-free, there may be attempts to access unallocated memory due to incorrect memory unreferencing, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP interpreter by exploiting the double-free and memory corruption issues. This can bypass security restrictions like `disable_functions`, `open_basedir`, or `safe_mode`.
- Denial of Service: The double free can also crash the PHP interpreter

**Attack vectors:**
- By triggering a call to a function such as `uksort()` and providing crafted data to the comparison function could trigger this vulnerability.
- Remote exploitation is possible if a vulnerable code path is accessible externally.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input data which will eventually be passed to the `array_user_key_compare()` function, through functions such as `uksort()` or other functions using that.
- They must also be able to cause a code path which will trigger the vulnerable function with this controlled input.
