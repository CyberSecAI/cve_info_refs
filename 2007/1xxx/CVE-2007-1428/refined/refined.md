  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_3e1054e9_20250125_192004.html",
      "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `search.php` file. The `salary` parameter is used directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames and passwords.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to `search.php`",
        "Modifying the `salary` parameter with a crafted SQL payload."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `search.php` script. They do not require any prior authentication or access to the system.",
       "additional_details": "The provided exploit code demonstrates a blind SQL injection technique, where the attacker injects a SQL query into the `salary` parameter to extract database information. The provided code constructs a malicious payload that uses `UNION SELECT` to concatenate usernames and passwords from the 'users' table, demonstrating how an attacker could exfiltrate credentials from the database."
