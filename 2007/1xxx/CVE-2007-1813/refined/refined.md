Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2007-1813
*   **Vulnerable Software:** XOOPS Module eCal 2.24
*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Root Cause:** The `display.php` script in the eCal module is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `katid` parameter. The script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, where user-controlled input is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries. The provided exploit specifically aims to extract usernames and passwords from the `mysql.user` table.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   HTTP GET Request: The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request. The `katid` parameter in the `display.php` script is manipulated to include malicious SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Remote: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
    *   Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
    *   Knowledge of vulnerable URL parameter: The attacker must know the URL path to the vulnerable script (`/modules/ecal/display.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`katid`).

**Additional Notes**

* The exploit code provided is written in Perl and details the exact steps to reproduce the attack.
* The exploit utilizes a blind SQL injection technique to extract data. It relies on specific string patterns (`username:`, `password:`) to identify the desired output within the response.
* The provided script has a basic check for `Syntax error` and `Internal Server Error` to identify whether the exploit was successful.
* This exploit retrieves information from the `mysql.user` table, likely aiming for admin credentials.
