Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and authorization checks in the DropAFew application, a multi-user calorie counting program written in PHP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in `search.php` and `search-pda.php` within the delete action, allowing attackers to manipulate SQL queries via the `id` parameter.
    *   An SQL injection is present in `editlogcal.php`'s save action via the `calories` variable in an UPDATE statement.
*   **Authorization Issues:**
    *   The `id` parameter in `editlogcal.php` lacks authorization checks, allowing any user to view calorie logs of other users, although without knowing which user logged them.
*   **Spam/Link Injection:**
    *   The `links.php` allows any user to add public links to other users' link pages, which cannot be removed by the target user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Corruption/Deletion:** Attackers can delete the entire `foodfacts` table or corrupt the `logcal` table.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Attackers can modify data, making it appear as if all users have consumed the same item with the same calorie count.
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can see all logged calories for all users without knowing who logged them.
*   **Potential for Spam:** The links injection vulnerability could be exploited to inject spam links on a user's profile.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Exploits are performed using crafted HTTP POST requests by manipulating parameters like `id` and `calories`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a user account on the DropAFew application.
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
*   No special privileges are required other than having a basic user account.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists even with `magic_quotes_gpc` set to on, and does not require query stacking to be exploited.
*   The advisory provides explicit exploit steps using `wget`.
*   The issue was reported to the vendor, who released a patched version (0.2.1).

This information is significantly more detailed than a basic CVE description would provide, offering concrete examples of exploitation.
