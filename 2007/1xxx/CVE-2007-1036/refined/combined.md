## JBoss Application Server may not properly restrict access to the administrative interface

#### Vulnerability Note VU#632656

Original Release Date: 2007-02-20 | Last Revised: 2007-02-21

---

### Overview

The JBoss Application Server may allow unauthenticated, remote access to the administrative console.

### Description

| [JBoss](http://www.jboss.com/) is an open source application server implemented in Java. Because it is Java-based, JBoss can be used on any operating system that supports Java. JBoss servers can be remotely managed through a web-based administrative interface.  If JBoss is installed without using the advanced installer options, the JBoss [security features](http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=SecureJBoss) will need to be configured manually. If a JBoss server is configured to allow unauthenticated access to the administrative interface, and is accessible from a remote network, then an attacker may be able to access and modify data on the server.Note that it may be possible to enumerate vulnerable servers by using search engines. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to gain administrative access to a JBoss Application Server. Once an attacker has access, they may be able to access and modify data on that server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Use the installer**Using the advanced installer options will configure JBoss to only allow authenticated administrative access. |
| --- |

| **Enable role based security**Enabling role based security may mitigate this vulnerability. See the [SecureTheJmxConsole](http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=SecureTheJmxConsole) page on the JBoss wiki for more information.**Restrict access**Restricting access to the administrative interface to trusted hosts may mitigate this vulnerability. See the [LimitAccessToCertainClients](http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=LimitAccessToCertainClients) page on the JBoss wiki for more information. |

### [Red Hat, Inc.](#RGII-6YLSBV) Affected

Updated:  February 21, 2007

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The JBoss AS console manager should always be secured prior to deployment, as directed in the JBoss Application Server Guide and release notes. By default, the JBoss AS installer gives users the ability to password protect the console manager. If the user did not use the installer, the raw JBoss services will be in a completely unconfigured state and these steps should be performed manually:
