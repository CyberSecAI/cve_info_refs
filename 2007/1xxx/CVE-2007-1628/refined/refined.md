Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1628:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the Study planner (Studiewijzer) application. It stems from the improper sanitization of the `$SPL_CFG['dirroot']` variable used in `include_once()` function calls. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when `register_globals` is enabled and `allow_fopenurl` is also enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes files based on a user-supplied parameter without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to include remote files from a server they control.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `$SPL_CFG['dirroot']` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in the include statement.
- **Reliance on `register_globals`:** The exploit relies on the PHP configuration option `register_globals` being enabled, which is a deprecated and insecure feature.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **System access:** By including malicious PHP code, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server and potentially gain full system access.
- **Data theft/manipulation:** Remote file inclusion can be used to steal sensitive data stored on the server and manipulate existing data.
- **Complete compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the vulnerable server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET parameter manipulation:** The attacker injects the URL of their malicious file into the `SPL_CFG[dirroot]` parameter through an HTTP GET request.
- **Affected files:** The vulnerability is present in multiple files, including `inc/service.alert.inc.php`, `inc/settings.ses.php`, `db/mysql/db.inc.php`, `integration/shortstat/configuration.php`, and several other files within the `methodology` directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely without requiring any prior access to the server.
- **Basic understanding of web vulnerabilities:** Knowledge of RFI vulnerabilities and how to construct malicious URLs is needed.
- **Vulnerable server:** The target server must be running the vulnerable Study planner (Studiewijzer) application and have the insecure PHP settings (`register_globals=on` and `allow_fopenurl=on`) enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit also mentions that many other files are vulnerable.
- The provided advisory also suggests to sanitize the `$SPL_CFG['dirroot']` variable and to turn off `register_globals`.
- The exploit is rated as "Dangerous" due to the potential for complete system compromise.
