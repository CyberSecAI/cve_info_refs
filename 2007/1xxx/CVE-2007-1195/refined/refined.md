Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a format string vulnerability present in the XM Easy Personal FTP Server 5.3.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The server is vulnerable to format string attacks. Every command is affected, and even a single "%" character can crash the server.
*   **Buffer Overflow:**  Multiple buffer overflows are also present in the commands when the server is fuzzed, which could potentially lead to code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is denial of service. By sending a specially crafted format string, an attacker can crash the FTP server.
*   **Potential Code Execution:** The presence of buffer overflow vulnerabilities suggests that successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, although this is not explicitly demonstrated.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is through the network, by sending specially crafted commands to the FTP server.
*   **FTP Commands:**  Any FTP command is vulnerable, and the exploit code demonstrates the use of "ABOR" command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable FTP server.
*   **FTP Client:** The attacker can use an FTP client (or write a script) to send commands to the FTP server.
*   **Basic FTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the FTP protocol and how to send commands to the server.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**

*   The provided exploit code uses Perl's Net::FTP module to connect to the server, log in, and send the malicious "ABOR" command with a format string payload.
*   The exploit code uses `%n` repeated ten times as a payload, which causes a crash.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Umesh Wanve.
*   The exploit was published on 2007-02-28.
*   The exploit is categorized as a "dos" (Denial of Service) exploit.

In summary, CVE-2007-1195 is due to format string and buffer overflow vulnerabilities in XM Easy Personal FTP Server 5.3.0, allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial of service, and potentially, arbitrary code execution.
