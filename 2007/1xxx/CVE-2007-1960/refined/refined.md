```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `visit.php` script in the Rha7 Downloads module for XOOPS is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `lid` parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL injection. The script directly incorporates user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords.
- Attack vectors: A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `visit.php` script, injecting malicious SQL code through the `lid` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
