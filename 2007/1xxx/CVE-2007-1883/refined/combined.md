How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# PHP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200710-02**

PHP contains several vulnerabilities including buffer and integer overflows
which could lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.2.4\_p20070914-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.2.4\_p20070914-r2** |

### Background

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP. Mattias Bengtsson and Philip
Olausson reported integer overflows in the gdImageCreate() and
gdImageCreateTrueColor() functions of the GD library which can cause
heap-based buffer overflows (CVE-2007-3996). Gerhard Wagner discovered
an integer overflow in the chunk\_split() function that can lead to a
heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-2872). Its incomplete fix caused
incorrect buffer size calculation due to precision loss, also resulting
in a possible heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-4661 and
CVE-2007-4660). A buffer overflow in the sqlite\_decode\_binary() of the
SQLite extension found by Stefan Esser that was addressed in PHP 5.2.1
was not fixed correctly (CVE-2007-1887).

Stefan Esser discovered an error in the zend\_alter\_ini\_entry() function
handling a memory\_limit violation (CVE-2007-4659). Stefan Esser also
discovered a flaw when handling interruptions with userspace error
handlers that can be exploited to read arbitrary heap memory
(CVE-2007-1883). Disclosure of sensitive memory can also be triggered
due to insufficient boundary checks in the strspn() and strcspn()
functions, an issue discovered by Mattias Bengtsson and Philip Olausson
(CVE-2007-4657)

Stefan Esser reported incorrect validation in the FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL
filter of the Filter extension allowing arbitrary email header
injection (CVE-2007-1900). NOTE: This CVE was referenced, but not fixed
in GLSA 200705-19.

Stanislav Malyshev found an error with unknown impact in the
money\_format() function when processing "%i" and "%n" tokens
(CVE-2007-4658). zatanzlatan reported a buffer overflow in the
php\_openssl\_make\_REQ() function with unknown impact when providing a
manipulated SSL configuration file (CVE-2007-4662). Possible memory
corruption when trying to read EXIF data in exif\_read\_data() and
exif\_thumbnail() occurred with unknown impact.

Several vulnerabilities that allow bypassing of open\_basedir and other
restrictions were reported, including the glob() function
(CVE-2007-4663), the session\_save\_path(), ini\_set(), and error\_log()
functions which can allow local command execution (CVE-2007-3378),
involving the readfile() function (CVE-2007-3007), via the Session
extension (CVE-2007-4652), via the MySQL extension (CVE-2007-3997) and
in the dl() function which allows loading extensions outside of the
specified directory (CVE-2007-4825).

Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities were discovered, including a
long "library" parameter in the dl() function (CVE-2007-4887), in
several iconv and xmlrpc functions (CVE-2007-4840 and CVE-2007-4783),
in the setlocale() function (CVE-2007-4784), in the glob() and
fnmatch() function (CVE-2007-4782 and CVE-2007-3806), a floating point
exception in the wordwrap() function (CVE-2007-3998), a stack
exhaustion via deeply nested arrays (CVE-2007-4670), an infinite loop
caused by a specially crafted PNG image in the png\_read\_info() function
of libpng (CVE-2007-2756) and several issues related to array
conversion.

### Impact

Remote attackers might be able to exploit these issues in PHP
applications making use of the affected functions, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code, Denial of Service,
execution of scripted contents in the context of the affected site,
security bypass or information leak.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-5.2.4_p20070914-r2"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
