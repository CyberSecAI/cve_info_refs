```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `topliste` module for PHP-Fusion contains an SQL injection vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of the `cid` parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information such as user credentials. In this specific exploit, the attacker retrieves the `user_name` and `user_password` from the `fusion_users` table.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exposed through the `cid` parameter within the `index.php` script of the `topliste` module.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need any special privileges or local access.
