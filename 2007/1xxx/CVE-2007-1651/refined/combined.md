Presumably, this is true only:

a) as long as I am still logged into the OpenID provider,
b) the remote site knows the OpenID login URL of the client site.

Correct? The risk here is that I would have a session with the client
site without explicitly asking for it?

This case I don't understand well. If the provider prevents replay
attacks of trust dialogs with the user (e.g. nonce in form) and requires
the request to come from the user agent with a valid session, how could
a remote site establish such permanent trust?

I think the second case already requires authorization by the user.
Properly developed providers should ask for the user to grant trust to
the consumer site, and not be susceptible to crafted requests to bypass
user dialog.

Yes you have to be logged onto the OpenID server and must have
always trust selected for that site. Finding the OpenID login URL
isn't hard ;)

Actually it is possible to get the token but I can't reveal
anything until the problem has been fixed on the MyOpenID server.
At the moment one browser has the problem but I think it would be
quite easy to produce the same technique for other browsers.

That's a great point Hans, we'll exercise restraint as well if that's the
case.

Excellent idea.  This seems like a great wiki topic "How to report a
security vulnerability".

Hi everyone

MyOpenID have fixed the problem with their site now so I shall give
everyone on this list 1 week from now to contact me (29th March). I
have had two people contact me regarding the problem and 1 beta
OpenID server was affected and the other wasn't.

If I don't receive a email from anyone else I shall post the
details of the exploit as I feel it would benefit the community on
this list.

Cheers

Gareth

Hi everyone

I've found 2 problems with the MyOpenID.com site, I've contacted
them to report the problem but I also believe there is a problem
with how OpenID itself works. I've been told many times that it
isn't a specific problem with OpenID on another list but I'm pretty
sure it is.

I don't know what the position is on disclosure so I thought I
would just describe what is possible on the MyOpenID site and see
if the problem has been encountered before.

1. First of all if you sign into a OpenID server in this case
(MyOpenID.com) then logon to an OpenID enabled site like
(<http://ficlets.com/>) then sign out of the OpenID enabled site. It
is possible to log them back onto the site from any remote web site.

2. The second problem is more serious you can create a specially
crafted web page to automatically log on to a web site and also add
that web site to the allow forever trusted site. The only
requirement is that you have to be logged onto the OpenID server.

Both cases can be prevented if the OpenID specification requires
authorisation regardless of a cached token.

Cheers

Gareth
