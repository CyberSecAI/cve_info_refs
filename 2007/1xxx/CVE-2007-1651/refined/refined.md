Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the OpenID protocol's handling of cached tokens and trust establishment, specifically how MyOpenID.com implemented it. The core issue revolves around the ability of a malicious actor to bypass user authorization for establishing permanent trust with a relying party (RP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   1. **Session Replay (Auto Login):** If a user is logged into an OpenID provider (MyOpenID.com in this case) and has previously logged into an OpenID-enabled site, it's possible for a malicious site to automatically log the user back into the OpenID-enabled site without explicit consent. This occurs because the OpenID provider may maintain a session, and the attacker site can trigger the login without direct user interaction.
   2. **Automated Trust Establishment:** A specially crafted web page can automatically log a user into an OpenID-enabled website and also add that site to the "allow forever trusted sites" list. This is more critical because it bypasses the intended user authorization dialog for permanent trust and could lead to unauthorized access later.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to OpenID-enabled sites on behalf of a logged-in user, without the user's explicit consent.
   - **Permanent Trust Compromise:** The ability to force "always allow" trust undermines the user's control over which sites they grant long-term access, posing future security risks for the users.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious Web Page:** The attacker crafts a malicious web page. When a victim visits this page while logged into the OpenID provider, the exploit is triggered in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **User Logged In:** The user must be logged into the vulnerable OpenID provider.
   - **OpenID-enabled site used previously:** The user must have logged in to the target website previously.
   - **Knowledge of OpenID Login URL:** The attacker needs to know the OpenID login URL of the client/relying party site. This information is easily obtained.
   - **Ability to create malicious web page:** The attacker must be able to create a web page with crafted requests that triggers the vulnerable behavior.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is not necessarily a flaw in the OpenID specification itself but could result from how OpenID providers are implementing it.
- The second issue is considered more serious, as it allows for the circumvention of the user trust dialogue.
- A nonce or a similar mechanism to prevent replay attacks of trust dialogs was not effectively implemented, or could be bypassed.
- The attacker is able to obtain a token to establish permanent trust without the user's interaction.
- The specific method of how the token is obtained and used was not disclosed publicly but was actively being fixed by MyOpenID at the time of the disclosure.
- Some browsers may be more susceptible to the second issue than others.

The content indicates the issue was fixed by MyOpenID, and that the details of the exploit would be released later.
