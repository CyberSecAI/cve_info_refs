{
  "CVE-2007-1265": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Multiple Messages Problem in GnuPG and GPGME",
    "details": "The vulnerability stems from how GnuPG handles signed messages when used in streaming mode. An attacker can insert arbitrary text before or after a signed OpenPGP message, potentially misleading the user into believing that the additional text is also part of the signed content. This is a variant of a known issue where the signed portion of a message is not clearly delineated from unsigned data.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the lack of strict verification of message boundaries when GnuPG processes signed messages in streaming mode. Specifically, if additional data is prepended to or appended after a signed message, naive usage of gpg may not identify the actual signed content. This is due to insufficient usage of gpg status interface to verify signed or signed and encrypted messages.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The main weakness is the ability to forge signed messages by prepending arbitrary content, which is then displayed as part of the signed message.",
      "Lack of proper usage of the status interface in applications using GnuPG leads to improper message boundary handling."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can forge signed messages, potentially leading users to believe that unsigned content is trustworthy and validated by the signature. This could be used to spread misinformation, or trick a user into performing actions based on the fraudulent message.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The primary attack vector is manipulating the message stream by injecting additional plaintext before the actual signed message.",
        "The attack can be performed by creating a signed message, adding plaintext content before it, and then tricking a recipient to process it without proper parsing."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create OpenPGP messages (signed or signed and encrypted), add additional text before or after the signed message and have the victim process the composite message with a vulnerable application, using a vulnerable version of GnuPG or GPGME.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability affects all applications using GnuPG without properly using the status interface to verify signed or signed and encrypted messages. All GPGME versions up to and including 1.1.3 are also vulnerable. The issue is resolved in GnuPG versions 1.4.7 and 2.0.3 and later. Detached signatures are not affected by this vulnerability. The announcement also included information on patches and workarounds."
