# OpenAFS: Privilege escalation — GLSA **200704-03**

OpenAFS is subject to a design flaw that could allow privilege escalation
on the client.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-fs/openafs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.4** |

### Background

OpenAFS is a distributed network filesystem.

### Description

Benjamin Bennett discovered that the OpenAFS client contains a design
flaw where cache managers do not use authenticated server connections
when performing actions not requested by a user.

### Impact

If setuid is enabled on the client cells, an attacker can supply a fake
FetchStatus reply that sets setuid and root ownership of a file being
executed. This could provide root access on the client. Remote attacks
may be possible if an attacker can entice a user to execute a known
file. Note that setuid is enabled by default in versions of OpenAFS
prior to 1.4.4.

### Workaround

Disable the setuid functionality on all client cells. This is now the
default configuration in OpenAFS.

### Resolution

All OpenAFS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/openafs-1.4.4"
```

The OpenAFS Gatekeepers announce the availability of OpenAFS version
1.4.4.  Source files and available binaries can be accessed via the web at:

       <http://www.openafs.org/dl/openafs/1.4.4/>

or via AFS at:

/afs/grand.central.org/software/openafs/1.4.4/
\\afs\grand.central.org\software\openafs\1.4.4\

This is the current recommended release for all Unix platforms; For Windows, we
recommend use of the current 1.5 series release for best performance.

                   OpenAFS Release Notes - Version 1.4.4
      _________________________________________________________________
All Unix systems: Major security bugfix. Minor bugfixes.
Windows: Minor bugfixes.
      _________________________________________________________________

* Security bugfix:

- SetUID is no longer honored for the local cell by default. The
   "fs setcellstatus" command must be issued for any cell the system
   administrator wishes to allow setuid files in.

>From 1.4.3:

* Bugfixes:

Windows:
- Return the correct error code when attempting to remove a
   directory that still contains entries.

- Allow renames on inexact case match to allow offline folders to work
   correctly.

- VICECONNBAD and VICETOKENDEAD force the use of a new rx connection.

- Fix afslogon.dll to not publish environment variables into
   the subprocesses started from winlogon.exe

- Fix afslogon.dll to initialize and uninitialize winsock so
   that Kerberos 4 send_to_kdc() can succeed

- When opening a directory, CIFS read privilege requires PRSFS_LOOKUP
   not PRSFS_READ.

All unix systems:

- Make new connection forcing apply even when there is only one interface,
   so we can recover servers marked down due to our address changing.

- Fix Universal AFS Error mapping when the local OS does not define some
   errors.

- Avoid byte range locking for java when it means to ask for a whole file
   lock but uses a -1 length.

- Avoid overwriting random memory if the system has too many addresses at
   cache manager start time.

- Allow foreign vlservers to properly time out before first use.

- Attempt to clean up from dead tokens without discarding valid ones.

- Reinit resolver library on afsdb failure.

Linux:

- Allow PAG to be stored as a single "large" group instead of 2 16 bit groups.

- Fix use of tasklist lock based on availability of lock.

- Avoid leaking cred references in the kernel during failed lookups.

- Further fixes to syscall table probing.

- Updates for kernel header changes.

- Use the AFS vfs magic number.

- Fix keyring based PAGs to persist across a change.

- Avoid leaking locks when closing Firefox.

- Fix lock pid tracking to allow better cleanup and avoid bogus assert.

- Remove deadlock-prone cred pool implementation entirely.

MacOS:

- Fake more free disk for apps which do not actually check.

Solaris:

- Updates to use only public kernel interfaces.

All systems:

- Make rxdebug be less aggressive when retransmitting.

- Allow unix domain socket for fileserver-volserver communication.

- Fix server fake address support when NetRestrict is being used.

- Fix crash when 3.4 jumbograms are part of an Rx connection.

- Fix crashes in pts chown and pts rename.

- Make asetkey buildable with Heimdal.

- Avoid potential orphaned files during vos restore.

- Improve ubik debug logging.

- Add vldb repair tool.

- Avoid potential bosserver process list corruption.

- Revert to previous fileserver startup attachment order.

Binary releases are available for AIX 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3; Irix 6.5; Solaris 7, 8,
9 and 10 on Sparc and 10 on Intel; RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 on
Intel and AMD64; Fedora Core 3, 4, 5 and 6 on Intel and 5 and 6 on
AMD64; MacOS 10.4 Universal; HP-UX11i on PA-RISC; and Windows
2000, XP and 2003 on Intel, while source is available in gzipped, bzipped, and
uncompressed tar files.

Bug reports should be filed to openafs-bugs@openafs.org.

Thanks are due as usual to our dedicated team of binary builders without whom
the broad range of released binaries would not be possible.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [OpenAFS-announce] OpenAFS Security Advisory 2007-001: privilege escalation in Unix-based clients

**Derrick J Brashear**

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

 		OpenAFS Security Advisory 2007-001

Topic: setuid (privilege escalation) in OpenAFS Unix based clients

Issued:		20-Mar-2007
Last Update:	20-Mar-2007
Affected:	OpenAFS 1.0 - 1.4.3, OpenAFS 1.5.0 - 1.5.16

A user with network access and knowledge of client cache contents can
promote a file to a setuid mode and any owner including root.

SUMMARY
=======

Because AFS cache managers do not use authenticated connections for
non-user-authenticated sessions, checks for cache coherency are done
over an unprotected connection if they are not being done for an
authenticated user. Because of this it is possible to spoof a false
status for files in the cache.

The AFS cache manager on platforms which offer privilege based on file modes
are vulnerable to such attacks.

There are no known publicly-available exploits for this vulnerability at
this time.

IMPACT
======

An attacker with knowledge of a file in the client can spoof a
FetchStatus reply with a setuid mode and root owner after flushing the
cache locally to invalidate the file status.

If the executable file is subsequently run and setuid status for the cell is
not disabled, privilege escalation will take place. Variants of this attack
may be possible without local client access if the attacker knows of specific
files being run from AFS on the client system.

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================

All releases of OpenAFS 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 1.2.x, and 1.3.x.
All releases of OpenAFS 1.4.x, up to and including OpenAFS 1.4.3.
All releases of OpenAFS 1.5.x, up to and including OpenAFS 1.5.16.

FIXES
=====

The OpenAFS project recommends that users with systems which could be
compromised by privilege escalation upgrade to OpenAFS version
1.4.4 or newer. Only clients need to be upgraded. Note that this
vulnerability does not apply to Windows systems.

The latest stable OpenAFS release is
always available from <http://www.openafs.org/release/latest.html.>

For those who are unable to upgrade, setuid status can always be
disabled by running, as the super user on any client:
     fs setcell -cell (local cell) -nosuid

This announcement and code patches related to it may be found on the
OpenAFS security advisory page at:

     <http://www.openafs.org/security/>

The main OpenAFS web page is at:

     <http://www.openafs.org/>

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================

Thanks to Benjamin Bennett from the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center for
reporting this issue.

DETAIL
======
Client systems are not required to have a Kerberos key cached, and
those which do would likely not have an AFS identity precreated for them.
Connections other than those on behalf of a user are thus not as
general practice authenticated, although it is theoretically possible to
do so.

Because the connection is not authenticated it is possible to spoof network
traffic from the server without it being detected. Trusting unauthentic server
answers to allow assignment of proper privilege level can allow privilege
escalation.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [OpenAFS-announce] OpenAFS 1.5.17 release available

```
The OpenAFS Gatekeepers announce the availability of OpenAFS
version 1.5.17.  Source files and available binaries can be
accessed via the web at:

      <http://www.openafs.org/release/openafs-1.5.17.html>

or via AFS at:

      UNIX: /afs/grand.central.org/software/openafs/1.5.17/
      UNC:  \\afs\grand.central.org\software\openafs\1.5.17\

All UNIX platforms:
-------------------
* Security bugfix:

- SetUID is no longer honored for the local cell by default. The
    "fs setcellstatus" command must be issued for any cell the system
    administrator wishes to allow setuid files in.

Microsoft Windows:
------------------
OpenAFS 1.5.17 is the recommended production ready release for Microsoft
Windows users supporting all Microsoft Windows operating systems from
Windows 2000 to Windows Vista including both 32-bit and 64-bit
architectures.

IMPORTANT: All users are recommended to upgrade to 1.5.16 or later in
order to address a serious error that will result in data corruption.  If
the network connectivity to the file server is lost while background write
operations have been queued, the writes will not succeed and that data
will not be written to the file server.  This leaves a hole in the file
filled with NULs.    This bug is present in all releases of OpenAFS for
Windows prior to 1.5.15 and IBM Windows AFS releases prior to 3.6 2.59.

This release of OpenAFS for Windows is built using the corrected C
Runtime Library for the Spring 2007 DST changes.

Other significant changes:

     * Improved NAT behavior due to reduced probe time.
     * Improved NAT behavior due to forcing a new connection before
       marking a server down.

Known issues:

     * Beta versions of the Network Identity Manager AFS plug-in must be
       uninstalled prior to the installation of OpenAFS 1.5.17
     * Windows Vista does not support the old WinHelp file format used by
       afscreds.exe and afs_control.exe.
     * On Windows Vista, afscreds.exe and afs_config.exe are not User
       Account Control (UAC) compatible and must be "Run as
       Administrator" in order to modify the AFS Client Configuration or
       start/stop the AFS client service.

Please visit <http://www.openafs.org/windows.html> for up to date
information on the status of the OpenAFS for Windows client.

Bug reports should be filed to openafs-bugs@openafs.org .  Reports of
success should be sent to openafs-info@openafs.org .

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1271-1                security@debian.org

Package        : openafs
Vulnerability  : design error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-1507

A design error has been identified in the OpenAFS, a cross-platform
distributed filesystem included with Debian.

OpenAFS historically has enabled setuid filesystem support for the local
cell.  However, with its existing protocol, OpenAFS can only use
encryption, and therefore integrity protection, if the user is
authenticated.  Unauthenticated access doesn't do integrity protection.
The practical result is that it's possible for an attacker with
knowledge of AFS to forge an AFS FetchStatus call and make an arbitrary
binary file appear to an AFS client host to be setuid.  If they can then
arrange for that binary to be executed, they will be able to achieve
privilege escalation.

OpenAFS 1.3.81-3sarge2 changes the default behavior to disable setuid
files globally, including the local cell.  It is important to note that
this change will not take effect until the AFS kernel module, built from
the openafs-modules-source package, is rebuilt and loaded into your
kernel.  As a temporary workaround until the kernel module can be
reloaded, setuid support can be manually disabled for the local cell by
running the following command as root

      fs setcell -cell <localcell> -nosuid

Following the application of this update, if you are certain there is
no security risk of an attacker forging AFS fileserver responses, you
can re-enable setuid status selectively with the following command,
however this should not be done on sites that are visible to the
Internet

      fs setcell -cell <localcell> -suid

For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.81-3sarge2.  For the unstable distribution (sid) and the
upcoming stable distribution (etch), this problem will be fixed in
version 1.4.2-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian 3.1 (stable)
- -------------------

Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.

In this email, I just want to indicate two things for R ebuild.  I wish the R developers would change their bug fix patch releases to something  more compatible to gentoo :) Like a once a month patch that is  versioned, i.e R-1.4.1-20020401.patch.gz.  As this would make our life  much easier :)     > The first thing is that when I use R in gentoo, I found that some CONTENTS  > files such as /usr/lib/R/library/eda/CONTENTS was not available and caused  > some error messages when I started help.start().

(once I set galeon per your info below,  help.start() works ffor me) Might need further investigation though.  >   > The other thing is about the netscape thing you have listed in the  > Changelog.

You can change the file  > src/library/profile/Rprofile.unix in source package to make the same change.    Hey, cool! It works for galeon too.  It seems Rprofile can be a user  config file too (like .bashrc).  I don't know offhand if Gentoo uses a  ENV variable to specify browser, i.e. BROWSER="galeon", so we could grab  that value and insert it into the system Rprofile. If not we could einfo  in pkg_postinst, to tell the user to copy Rprofile to their home  directory and configure for their preferences ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tristan Henderson    2002-05-27 11:11:05 UTC  ``` I don't know if I should open a new bug for this (or whether one already exists - searching  bugzilla for "R" brings up quite a few results...). R 1.5.0 has been out since the end of April.  Simply copying dev-lang/R-1.4.1-r1.ebuild to R-1.5.0.ebuild seems to work for me. It would  also be nice if the R ebuild included the recommended packages  (<http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.5.0-recommended.tgz>), but R CMD INSTALL only seems  to install in the existing R location, rather than the /var/tmp/portage location required by ebuild. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tristan Henderson    2002-06-18 02:16:03 UTC  ``` To follow up to this, R 1.5.1 is now out. Here is an e-build, and a patch to fix the tcl/tk  interface. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Tristan Henderson    2002-06-18 02:16:44 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1577](attachment.cgi?id=1577 "R 1.5.1 ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=1577&action=edit "R 1.5.1 ebuild")] R 1.5.1 ebuild ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Tristan Henderson    2002-06-18 02:17:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1578](attachment.cgi?id=1578 "R 1.5.1 tcltk patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=1578&action=edit "R 1.5.1 tcltk patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=1578&action=diff "R 1.5.1 tcltk patch")] R 1.5.1 tcltk patch ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  George Shapovalov (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-07-13 00:55:13 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [4431](show_bug.cgi?id=4431 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-lang/R - help files not installed properly") *** ``` |  |
