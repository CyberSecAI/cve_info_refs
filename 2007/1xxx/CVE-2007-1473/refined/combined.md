How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi,
a few hours ago, Horde Framework 3.1.4 was released. This stable release
as well as a previous development release titled 3.1.4 RC1 fix a
script/HTML injection issue which does not require pevious
authentication by the victim.
By redirecting the victims' web browser to a specially crafted URL
containing the payload this issue can be exploited. As the users'
session cookie is already set by the time the injection takes place this
issue makes the user prone to XSS attacks.
The vulnerable file is framework/NLS/NLS.php.
Example:
[Base\_HREF]/horde/[Horde\_App]/login.php?new\_lang=%22%3E%3Cbody%20onload=
%22alert%28'XSS'%29%3B
[Horde\_App] should be replaced by the name of an installed Horde
application, such as 'imp'.
This can only be exploited on installations which are configured to
display a language selection box on the login pages.
This issue was /not/ initially discovered by me. I document it here as
I happened to come across this while discovering XSS issues in Horde IMP
and to simplify fixing vulnerable versions of repackaged distributions
of this software.
The developers' release announcement can be found at:
http://lists.horde.org/archives/announce/2007/000315.html
General information on this application is available at
http://www.horde.org/

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde
Application Framework version 3.1.4.

This is a bugfix release that also fixes an arbitrary file deletion
vulnerability exploitable by local system (not Horde) users on systems using
the example cron cleanup script.

Many thanks to the iDefense Vulnerability Contributor Program for reporting
these problems and working with us to test the fixes.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP. It provides an extensive array of libraries that are
targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in developing modern web
applications.

Major changes compared to Horde 3.1.4-RC1 are:
    * Correctly quote file names in cleanup script for temporary files.
    * Detect unencrypted PGP messages.

Major changes compared to Horde 3.1.3 are:
    * Rewritten Oracle session handler.
    * Added vTimezone support to iCalendar API and ORG support to vCard API.
    * Improved virtual domain support for Cyrus SQL authentication driver.
    * Improved Samba authentication driver.
    * Improved automatic webroot detection.
    * Improved signature dimming.
    * Improved compatibility of generated ZIP files.
    * Fixed an XSS vulnerability in the language selection.
    * Fixed validation of some email distribution lists.
    * Several Kolab related fixes.
    * Lots of small fixes and improvements.
    * Updated Brazilian Portuguese, Catalan, Dutch, French, German, Portuguese
      and Traditional Chinese translations.

The full list of changes (from version 3.1.3) can be viewed here:

<http://cvs.horde.org/diff.php/horde/docs/CHANGES?r1=1.515.2.261&r2=1.515.2.298&ty=h>
