Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-1118

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `path_to_smf` parameter in the `logout.php` and `get_session_vars.php` files of the eFiction application. This allows an attacker to control the path to the included file, leading to Remote File Inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes files based on a user-supplied parameter without proper validation. This can lead to arbitrary code execution by including a malicious file from a remote server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting a malicious script through the `path_to_smf` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the application and server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious URLs that pass a remote file path in the `path_to_smf` parameter. The vulnerable files are `logout.php` and `get_session_vars.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP GET requests to the target application
- The attacker needs a location to host a malicious script/shell that they can include

**Additional Notes**

- The provided exploit examples demonstrate the attack vector using the `path_to_smf` parameter, replacing `[Shell]` with the URL of the attacker's malicious file.
- This vulnerability is present in `eFiction` version `3.1.1`.
