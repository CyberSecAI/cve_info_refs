Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in eXV2 CMS:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Input passed to the `set_lang` parameter in `archive.php`, `article.php`, `index.php`, and `topics.php` is not sanitized before being displayed back to the user.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization or output encoding.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code into the user's browser session within the context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other malicious actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript in the `set_lang` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it.

2.  **Session Fixation:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application allows the `PHPSESSID` cookie to be set to an arbitrary value, including one controlled by an attacker.
    *   **Weakness:** The application does not properly invalidate or regenerate session identifiers.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can set a session ID, trick a user into logging in with that ID, and then use the same ID to impersonate the victim.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can use various techniques like cross-site scripting or crafting a malicious URL to set the `PHPSESSID` cookie to a value they control.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to set an arbitrary value for `PHPSESSID` cookie.

**Summary of fixes:**

*   **XSS:** Use `htmlspecialchars()` or `htmlentities()` functions to sanitize user input before outputting it to the browser.
*  **Session Fixation:**
    *   Do not accept session identifiers from GET/POST variables.
    *   Regenerate the session ID on each request.
    *   Only accept server-generated session IDs.
