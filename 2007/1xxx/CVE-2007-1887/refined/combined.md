## Details

Stefan Esser discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the "Month of PHP

bugs".

The substr\_compare() function did not sufficiently verify its length

argument. This might be exploited to read otherwise unaccessible

memory, which might lead to information disclosure. ([CVE-2007-1375](/security/CVE-2007-1375))

The shared memory (shmop) functions did not verify resource types,

thus they could be called with a wrong resource type that might

contain user supplied data. This could be exploited to read and write

arbitrary memory addresses of the PHP interpreter. This issue does

not affect Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-1376](/security/CVE-2007-1376))

The php\_binary handler of the session extension was missing a boundary

check. When unserializing overly long variable names this could be

exploited to read up to 126 bytes of memory, which might lead to

information disclosure. ([CVE-2007-1380](/security/CVE-2007-1380))

The internal array\_user\_key\_compare() function, as used for example by

the PHP function uksort(), incorrectly handled memory unreferencing of

its arguments. This could have been exploited to execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the PHP interpreter, and thus

circumventing any disable\_functions, open\_basedir, or safe\_mode

restrictions. ([CVE-2007-1484](/security/CVE-2007-1484))

The session\_regenerate\_id() function did not properly clean up the

former session identifier variable. This could be exploited to crash

the PHP interpreter, possibly also remotely. ([CVE-2007-1521](/security/CVE-2007-1521))

Under certain conditions the mb\_parse\_str() could cause the

register\_globals configuration option to become permanently enabled.

This opened an attack vector for a large and common class of

vulnerabilities. ([CVE-2007-1583](/security/CVE-2007-1583))

The session extension did not set the correct reference count value

for the session variables. By unsetting \_SESSION and HTTP\_SESSION\_VARS

(or tricking a PHP script into doing that) this could be exploited to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP interpreter. This

issue does not affect Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-1700](/security/CVE-2007-1700))

The mail() function did not correctly escape control characters in

multiline email headers. This could be remotely exploited to inject

arbitrary email headers. ([CVE-2007-1718](/security/CVE-2007-1718))

The php\_stream\_filter\_create() function had an off-by-one buffer

overflow in the handling of wildcards. This could be exploited to

remotely crash the PHP interpreter. This issue does not affect Ubuntu

7.04. ([CVE-2007-1824](/security/CVE-2007-1824))

When calling the sqlite\_udf\_decode\_binary() with special arguments, a

buffer overflow happened. Depending on the application this could be

locally or remotely exploited to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the PHP interpreter. ([CVE-2007-1887](/security/CVE-2007-1887) [CVE-2007-1888](/security/CVE-2007-1888))

The FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL filter extension used a wrong

regular expression that allowed injecting a newline character at the

end of the email string. This could be exploited to inject

arbitrary email headers. This issue only affects Ubuntu 7.04.

([CVE-2007-1900](/security/CVE-2007-1900))

# PHP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200710-02**

PHP contains several vulnerabilities including buffer and integer overflows
which could lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.2.4\_p20070914-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.2.4\_p20070914-r2** |

### Background

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP. Mattias Bengtsson and Philip
Olausson reported integer overflows in the gdImageCreate() and
gdImageCreateTrueColor() functions of the GD library which can cause
heap-based buffer overflows (CVE-2007-3996). Gerhard Wagner discovered
an integer overflow in the chunk\_split() function that can lead to a
heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-2872). Its incomplete fix caused
incorrect buffer size calculation due to precision loss, also resulting
in a possible heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-4661 and
CVE-2007-4660). A buffer overflow in the sqlite\_decode\_binary() of the
SQLite extension found by Stefan Esser that was addressed in PHP 5.2.1
was not fixed correctly (CVE-2007-1887).

Stefan Esser discovered an error in the zend\_alter\_ini\_entry() function
handling a memory\_limit violation (CVE-2007-4659). Stefan Esser also
discovered a flaw when handling interruptions with userspace error
handlers that can be exploited to read arbitrary heap memory
(CVE-2007-1883). Disclosure of sensitive memory can also be triggered
due to insufficient boundary checks in the strspn() and strcspn()
functions, an issue discovered by Mattias Bengtsson and Philip Olausson
(CVE-2007-4657)

Stefan Esser reported incorrect validation in the FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL
filter of the Filter extension allowing arbitrary email header
injection (CVE-2007-1900). NOTE: This CVE was referenced, but not fixed
in GLSA 200705-19.

Stanislav Malyshev found an error with unknown impact in the
money\_format() function when processing "%i" and "%n" tokens
(CVE-2007-4658). zatanzlatan reported a buffer overflow in the
php\_openssl\_make\_REQ() function with unknown impact when providing a
manipulated SSL configuration file (CVE-2007-4662). Possible memory
corruption when trying to read EXIF data in exif\_read\_data() and
exif\_thumbnail() occurred with unknown impact.

Several vulnerabilities that allow bypassing of open\_basedir and other
restrictions were reported, including the glob() function
(CVE-2007-4663), the session\_save\_path(), ini\_set(), and error\_log()
functions which can allow local command execution (CVE-2007-3378),
involving the readfile() function (CVE-2007-3007), via the Session
extension (CVE-2007-4652), via the MySQL extension (CVE-2007-3997) and
in the dl() function which allows loading extensions outside of the
specified directory (CVE-2007-4825).

Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities were discovered, including a
long "library" parameter in the dl() function (CVE-2007-4887), in
several iconv and xmlrpc functions (CVE-2007-4840 and CVE-2007-4783),
in the setlocale() function (CVE-2007-4784), in the glob() and
fnmatch() function (CVE-2007-4782 and CVE-2007-3806), a floating point
exception in the wordwrap() function (CVE-2007-3998), a stack
exhaustion via deeply nested arrays (CVE-2007-4670), an infinite loop
caused by a specially crafted PNG image in the png\_read\_info() function
of libpng (CVE-2007-2756) and several issues related to array
conversion.

### Impact

Remote attackers might be able to exploit these issues in PHP
applications making use of the affected functions, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code, Denial of Service,
execution of scripted contents in the context of the affected site,
security bypass or information leak.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PHP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-5.2.4_p20070914-r2"
```

# PHP 5.2.3 Release Announcement

The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate availability
of PHP 5.2.3. This release continues to improve the security and the
stability of the 5.X branch as well as addressing two regressions introduced
by the previous 5.2 releases. These regressions relate to the timeout
handling over non-blocking SSL connections and the lack of
HTTP\_RAW\_POST\_DATA in certain conditions. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to this release.

**Security Enhancements and Fixes in PHP 5.2.3:**

* Fixed an integer overflow inside chunk\_split() (by Gerhard Wagner, CVE-2007-2872)
* Fixed possible infinite loop in imagecreatefrompng. (by Xavier Roche, CVE-2007-2756)
* Fixed ext/filter Email Validation Vulnerability (MOPB-45 by Stefan Esser, CVE-2007-1900)
* Fixed bug #41492 (open\_basedir/safe\_mode bypass inside realpath()) (by bugs dot php dot net at chsc dot dk)
* Improved fix for CVE-2007-1887 to work with non-bundled sqlite2 lib.
* Added mysql\_set\_charset() to allow runtime altering of connection encoding.

**The key improvements of PHP 5.2.3 include:**

* Improved compilation of heredocs and interpolated strings.
* Optimized out a couple of per-request syscalls.
* Optimized digest generation in md5() and sha1() functions.
* Fixed bug #41236 (Regression in timeout handling of non-blocking SSL connections during reads and writes)
* Fixed bug #39542 (Behavior of require/include different to < 5.2.0)
* Fixed bug #41293 (Fixed creation of HTTP\_RAW\_POST\_DATA when there is no default post handler)
* Fixed bug #41347 (checkdnsrr() segfaults on empty hostname)
* Fixed bug #41353 (crash in openssl\_pkcs12\_read() on invalid input)
* Fixed bug #41403 (json\_decode cannot decode floats if localeconv decimal\_point is not '.')
* Fixed bug #41421 (Uncaught exception from a stream wrapper segfaults)
* Fixed bug #41504 (json\_decode() incorrectly decodes JSON arrays with empty string keys).
* Over 40 bug fixes.

For users upgrading from PHP 5.0 and PHP 5.1, an upgrade guide is available
[here](/UPDATE_5_2.txt), detailing the changes between those releases
and PHP 5.2.3.

For a full list of changes in PHP 5.2.3, see the [ChangeLog](/ChangeLog-5.php#5.2.3).

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, a
server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language, which may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-1286
    Stefan Esser discovered an overflow in the object reference handling
    code of the unserialize() function, which allows the execution of
    arbitrary code if malformed input is passed from an application.

CVE-2007-1375
    Stefan Esser discovered that an integer overflow in the substr_compare()
    function allows information disclosure of heap memory.

CVE-2007-1376
    Stefan Esser discovered that insufficient validation of shared memory
    functions allows the disclosure of heap memory.

CVE-2007-1380
    Stefan Esser discovered that the session handler performs
    insufficient validation of variable name length values, which allows
    information disclosure through a heap information leak.

CVE-2007-1453
    Stefan Esser discovered that the filtering framework performs insufficient
    input validation, which allows the execution of arbitrary code through a
    buffer underflow.

CVE-2007-1454
    Stefan Esser discovered that the filtering framework can be bypassed
    with a special whitespace character.

CVE-2007-1521
    Stefan Esser discovered a double free vulnerability in the
    session_regenerate_id() function, which allows the execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-1583
    Stefan Esser discovered that a programming error in the mb_parse_str()
    function allows the activation of "register_globals".

CVE-2007-1700
    Stefan Esser discovered that the session extension incorrectly maintains
    the reference count of session variables, which allows the execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-1711
    Stefan Esser discovered a double free vulnerability in the session
    management code, which allows the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-1718
    Stefan Esser discovered that the mail() function performs
    insufficient validation of folded mail headers, which allows mail
    header injection.

CVE-2007-1777
    Stefan Esser discovered that the extension to handle ZIP archives
    performs insufficient length checks, which allows the execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-1824
    Stefan Esser discovered an off-by-one in the filtering framework, which
    allows the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-1887
    Stefan Esser discovered that a buffer overflow in the sqlite extension
    allows the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-1889
    Stefan Esser discovered that the PHP memory manager performs an
    incorrect type cast, which allows the execution of arbitrary code
    through buffer overflows.

CVE-2007-1900
    Stefan Esser discovered that incorrect validation in the email filter
    extension allowed the injection of mail headers.

The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include php5.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 5.2.0-8+etch3.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.0-11.

We recommend that you upgrade your PHP packages. Packages for the arm,
hppa and mipsen architectures are not yet available. They will be
provided later.
