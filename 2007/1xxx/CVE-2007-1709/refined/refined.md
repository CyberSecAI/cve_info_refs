Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1709:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A local buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `confirm_phpdoc_compiled()` function of the `phpDOC` extension in PHP 5.2.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking in the `confirm_phpdoc_compiled()` function when handling user-supplied input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the target system. Specifically, the exploit attempts to execute `cmd.exe /c start notepad &`, opening notepad.
- The exploit uses an SEH overwrite method.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- The exploit requires the `phpDOC` extension to be loaded.
- The exploit needs to be launched from the command line (CLI).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the target system.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute PHP scripts.

**Additional notes:**

- The exploit provided is for Windows 2000 SP3, and potentially SP4 with adjustment to memory addresses.
- The exploit overwrites the SEH (Structured Exception Handler) to gain code execution.
- The exploit uses a specific return address from `kernel32.dll` (`0x77E93047`) which is a `pop ECX - pop - ret` instruction.
- The exploit payload includes shellcode to execute a command.
- The exploit contains padding (`\x90`) (NOP sled), the shellcode, and the overwritten EIP.
- The vulnerable function is `confirm_phpdoc_compiled()`.
- The exploit sets both the EIP and ECX registers to the same value for specific exploit purposes.
