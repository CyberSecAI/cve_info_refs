{
  "CVE-2007-1546": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Network Audio System (NAS), and this CVE refers to an array index error. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the `ProcAuSetElements` function in `server/dia/audispatch.c` and the `compileInputs` function in `server/dia/auutil.c`. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).",
    "Root cause": "An array index error due to insufficient bounds checking when processing client-provided data. Specifically, overly large `num_action` values in `ProcAuSetElements`, or a large `inputNum` parameter in `compileInputs` leads to out-of-bounds access.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient bounds checking",
      "Improper handling of client-provided data"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (server crash). An attacker can cause the NAS server to crash by sending specially crafted network requests.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote network attack. An attacker sends malicious network requests to the NAS server, exploiting the vulnerable functions.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to connect to the NAS server over the network and send specially crafted packets."
