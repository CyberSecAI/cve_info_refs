Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-1007:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a format string flaw present in the `gnomemeeting` VoIP application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A format string vulnerability exists in the way `gnomemeeting` processes certain messages from remote clients. Specifically, the remote name is passed to a logging function as a format string.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could send a crafted call request with a malicious name, and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `gnomemeeting`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted call request containing format string specifiers within the caller's name field.
- The vulnerable code is triggered when the remote name is passed to a logging function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a `gnomemeeting` instance that is listening for incoming calls.
- No special authentication or privilege escalation is required before exploitation of this issue.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is similar in nature to another format string flaw in Ekiga (CVE-2007-1006), however, they are triggered in different ways. In `ekiga` the remote name is passed to a display function, while in `gnomemeeting` it is passed to the logging function.
- Patches for this vulnerability involve ensuring that user-supplied strings are not used directly as format strings in logging/display functions, for example, using `gnomemeeting_log_insert ("%s",msg);` instead of `gnomemeeting_log_insert (msg);`.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of `gnomemeeting` and distributions including Ubuntu and Debian.
- The vulnerability is considered high-severity and requires a prompt patch for affected systems.

**Mitigation:**
- Update the affected packages to the patched versions as indicated in the provided advisories
  - Ubuntu 6.10: `ekiga 2.0.3-0ubuntu3.1`
  - Ubuntu 6.06: `ekiga 2.0.1-0ubuntu6.1`
  - Ubuntu 5.10: `gnomemeeting 1.2.2-1ubuntu1.1`
  - Debian Sarge: `gnomemeeting 1.2.1-1sarge1`
  - Debian Etch: `ekiga 2.0.3-2.1`
  - Debian Sid: `ekiga 2.0.3-2.1`
