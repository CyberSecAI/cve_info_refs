Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-1218

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an off-by-one heap-based buffer overflow in the `parse_elements()` function within `print-802_11.c`, specifically related to processing IEEE 802.11 frames. The vulnerability occurs because of an incorrect size check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Off-by-one heap overflow**: A single byte is written beyond the allocated buffer. The code checks the length of `pbody->tim.length`, but uses `pbody->rates.length` in the subsequent size check against the size of `pbody->tim.bitmap`.
    - `pbody->tim.length`, defined as `u_int8_t`, is used in line 265: `if (pbody->tim.length <= 3)`.
    - In line 267, the size check uses `pbody->rates.length`: `if (pbody->rates.length > sizeof pbody->tim.bitmap)`. This is the wrong variable and leads to a buffer overflow.
    - The vulnerable code is at lines 269-272:
```c
269         if (!TTEST2(*(p + offset), pbody->tim.length - 3))
270             return;
271         memcpy(pbody->tim.bitmap, p + (pbody->tim.length - 3),
272             (pbody->tim.length - 3))
```
    - If `pbody->tim.length` is set to 255, `(pbody->tim.length - 3)` will equal 252. The `memcpy` will copy 252 bytes into `pbody->tim.bitmap`, which is only 251 bytes in size, thus causing the off-by-one overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The overflow can cause a crash in `tcpdump`, leading to a denial of service. It is possible that the vulnerability could be exploited for more than just a DoS. While some sources initially referred to a heap-based overflow, others suggested that it might be stack-based.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted 802.11 frame:** A specifically crafted 802.11 frame is required to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** An attacker can be remote since a malicious frame can be sent over the network.
- **Explicitly specified link type:** The link type must have been explicitly specified for the vulnerability to be triggered, meaning the `-y` or `--linktype` command line option has been used.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects `tcpdump` version 3.9.5 and earlier.
- The issue was fixed in the CVS Head and in the `tcpdump_3_9` branch by correcting the comparison of length fields.
-  The Gentoo bug report indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in version 3.9.5-r2.
- Debian also addressed the issue in versions 3.8.3-5sarge2 (stable) and 3.9.5-2 (etch, unstable).
- The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-429-1) provides updates for Ubuntu 6.10 (3.9.4-4ubuntu0.1), 6.06 (3.9.4-2ubuntu0.1) and 5.10 (3.9.1-1ubuntu1.1).
