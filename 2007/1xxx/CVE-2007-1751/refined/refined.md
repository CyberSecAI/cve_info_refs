  "CVE-2007-1751": {
    "vulnerability_details": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.  The flaw is specifically exposed when a prototype variable points to a table cell and then that table cell is removed. This results in an invalid pointer dereference which can be leveraged to result in arbitrary code execution.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from Internet Explorer's improper handling of object access when an object has not been initialized or has been deleted. This leads to an uninitialized memory corruption issue.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized memory access",
        "Invalid pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could gain complete control of an affected system, install programs, or view/modify/delete data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based attack where an attacker hosts a malicious webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability.",
      "Compromised or malicious websites could also be utilized."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious code into a website. They also need to convince a user to visit this webpage."
