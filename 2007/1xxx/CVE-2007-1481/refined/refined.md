Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1481:

**Summary:**

The provided content indicates that CVE-2007-1481 is associated with a vulnerability in wbblog, a web application. The exploit-db entry, which is more detailed than the provided CVE description, indicates that this vulnerability allows for both Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying blog entries, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user input when querying the database for specific blog entries, allowing for the injection of SQL commands.

**Root Cause:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user inputs before displaying it (XSS) or before using it in SQL queries (SQL Injection).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of a user's browser. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the website, or perform other client-side attacks.
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data leakage, modification, or deletion, or even gaining full control of the database server. The provided exploit shows how to extract user emails and passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:**  A crafted URL is used to inject JavaScript. The vulnerable parameter is `e_id` in `index.php?cmd=viewentry`.
*   **SQL Injection:** A crafted URL is used to inject SQL. The vulnerable parameter is `e_id` in `index.php?cmd=viewentry`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker only needs to be able to craft and send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable `index.php` file. No special privileges are needed on the system.

**Technical Details:**

*   **XSS Payload:** `index.php?cmd=viewentry&e_id="><script>alert('HACKED')</script>`
*   **SQL Injection Payload:** `index.php?cmd=viewentry&e_id=-1/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/null,null,u_email,null,u_password,null/**/FROM/**/user/*`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry also references CVE-2007-1482, indicating that it might be another related vulnerability or a duplicate.
*   The vendor site for wbblog is listed as http://liqua.com/wbblog.html (may not be operational).
