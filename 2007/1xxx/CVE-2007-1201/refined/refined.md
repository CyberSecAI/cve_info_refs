  "CVE-2007-1201": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Office Web Components manages memory resources. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged on user. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Root cause": "An error in how Microsoft Office Web Components manages memory resources during data source operations may lead to memory corruption that allows for arbitrary code execution.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory management",
      "Remote code execution vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, gaining the same privileges as the logged-on user. This can lead to complete system compromise including installation of malware, data theft, modification, or deletion and creation of new user accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted web page",
       "Email or Instant Messenger messages containing malicious link"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a specially crafted web page or convince a user to view such content via a link in an email or Instant Messenger message. No user interaction beyond visiting the malicious page is required.",
    "Affected software": [
      "Microsoft Office Web Components 2000",
      "Microsoft Office 2000 Service Pack 3",
      "Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3",
      "Visual Studio .NET 2002 Service Pack 1",
      "Visual Studio .NET 2003 Service Pack 1",
      "Microsoft BizTalk Server 2000",
      "Microsoft BizTalk Server 2002",
      "Microsoft Commerce Server 2000",
       "Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2000 Service Pack 2"
    ],
    "Mitigations": [
        "Setting the kill bit for the vulnerable ActiveX control in Internet Explorer, which prevents the control from being instantiated. This can be done manually or through group policy.",
        "Unregistering the Office Web Components 2000 library (MSOWC.DLL).",
        "Running Internet Explorer with Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Server 2003, which sets the security level for the Internet zone to High."
