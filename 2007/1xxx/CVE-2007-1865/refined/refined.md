Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2007-1865:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `ipv6_getsockopt_sticky` function in the Linux kernel. A user-provided length (`len`) argument, if negative, can cause a kernel memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Handling:** The code within `ipv6_getsockopt_sticky` does not properly validate or handle negative values for the length parameter.
- **Memory Leak:**  A negative length value provided by a user can bypass the intended checks and result in a kernel memory leak during the copy operation to the user space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Memory Leak:** An attacker can trigger the memory leak by providing a negative length. Repeated exploitation can lead to memory exhaustion and potentially denial of service.
- **Information Disclosure:** While not explicitly stated, memory leaks may also lead to exposing sensitive kernel data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **`getsockopt` system call:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `getsockopt` system call by passing a socket option related to IPv6 and providing a negative value for the length argument.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:**  The attacker needs to have the ability to make system calls, thus a local user account is required.
- **System call access:** Specifically, the ability to call the `getsockopt` system call.
