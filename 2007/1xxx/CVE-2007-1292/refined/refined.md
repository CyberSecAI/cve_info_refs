Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `inlinemod.php` file of vBulletin versions 3.6.4 and earlier.
- The code insufficiently sanitizes the `postids` parameter when handling post copying operations. Specifically, it attempts to validate that the post IDs are integers using `intval()`, but it does not correctly handle cases where non-integer values are present in the array.
- When comparing a string with an integer, PHP attempts to convert the string to an integer by taking the leading integer characters of the string, which allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries via the `postids` parameter. This is due to how the code handles string vs integer comparison.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including admin session hashes. These hashes can be used to impersonate a logged-in admin user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Full Administrative Control:** A successful attack can grant the attacker full administrative control over the vBulletin forum.
- **Data Breach:** The attacker could potentially access and modify any data stored in the forum's database.
- **Forum Defacement:**  An attacker could deface the forum.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is via a crafted HTTP POST request to `inlinemod.php`.
- Specifically, the attacker manipulates the `postids` parameter with SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Moderator Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid moderator account on the forum.
- **Admin User Online:** An administrator has to be logged into the Admin Control Panel at the same time.
- **Same IP or Matching Octets:** The moderator account must originate from the same IP or the same number of IP octets (as specified in the Admin Control Panel settings) as a currently logged in admin.
- **Knowledge of Admin's Alt-IP and User Agent OR License Number** The attacker needs to know the admin's alt-IP and user agent, or the license number of the target site.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to leverage this vulnerability to extract administrator session hashes, modify a moderator's account to an administrator, and gain complete control of the forum. The exploit also shows that the attack works regardless of php.ini settings and provides a proposed patch by typecasting the postids variable to integer.
- The exploit uses a series of blind SQL injection queries, using the vulnerability to copy posts into new threads and then checking the contents of the new thread for a specific string to confirm success.
- The exploit is quite complex, as it bypasses restrictions placed on the admin session by copying session information for the active admin.
