- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The login page of the Avaya Communications Manager web interface has insufficient input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The login field allows arbitrary Javascript commands to be entered. These commands are then executed by the web browser when submitted. This is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of a user's browser session. This can allow an attacker to perform malicious actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on the user's behalf.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can inject arbitrary Javascript code into the "Login" field of the login page. When a user submits the form, the injected script will execute in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the login page of the Avaya Communications Manager web interface. They must be able to enter data into the login field.
