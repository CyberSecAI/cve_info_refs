```
This concerns the remote file include reported in PBLang here:

   <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/460315/30/0/threaded>

The code in index.php starts with:

   require ('header.php');
   include("global.php");
   include($dbpath."/settings.php");

header.php just sets some http headers, starts a session, and other
sorts of housekeeping; it doesn't reference $dbpath or include other files.

global.php doesn't exist out of the box but gets created as part of the
install to initialize constants, including $dbpath. At least as created,
it does not give a remote user any way to overwrite the setting for
$dbpath or use it, even indirectly. So this report looks bogus to me.

Btw, the download link in the advisory leads to version 4.65 as part the
enclosed docs/PBLang-update.txt (look at the bottom), not 4.60 as
claimed in the posting.
