Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within web page input fields of certain Avaya products. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands that can be executed by the underlying operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Shell Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation, allowing the injection of malicious shell commands.
- **Web Interface Vulnerability:** Specific web pages within the maintenance web interfaces of Avaya products are vulnerable to this type of attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Linux shell commands on the affected system.
- **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):** The injected commands are executed with the same privileges as the logged-in user, which could lead to privilege escalation if the user has administrative rights.
- **System Compromise:** Attackers can potentially gain full control of the system, depending on the specific user privileges and the commands they execute.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the vulnerable web pages of affected Avaya products.
- **Input Fields:** Attackers inject malicious shell commands via web page input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Avaya product's maintenance web pages, as the vulnerable pages are only accessible after authentication.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires local or network access to the vulnerable server. This access should be controlled by security measures like firewalls, ACLs and VPNs.

**Affected Products:**
- **Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300:** All versions prior to Communication Manager (CM) 3.1.3.
- **Avaya SES:** All versions.

**Mitigation:**
- **Avaya S87XX/S8500/S8300:** Upgrade to CM 3.1.3 or later.
- **Avaya SES:** Restrict local and network access to the server using physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other networking practices until a patch can be applied.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory emphasizes that while the risk level is considered low due to the need for authentication, the impact of successful exploitation is significant.
- Avaya recommends restricting access to vulnerable servers as an immediate measure.
