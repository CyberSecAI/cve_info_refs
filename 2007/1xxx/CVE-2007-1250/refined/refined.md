Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `default.asp` script within the Angel Learning Management Suite 7.1. Specifically, the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection flaw. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter of the `default.asp` script, an attacker can manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Database Access:** A successful exploit grants an attacker complete access to the database. This includes the ability to:
    *   Enumerate database tables and columns.
    *   Access sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, student grades, and test questions/answers.
    *   Potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, meaning no prior login or credentials are required.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a specific HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `default.asp` script.
*   **Malicious SQL Injection:**  The crafted request includes malicious SQL code within the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable Angel LMS instance.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to construct HTTP GET requests and URL encoding.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft the necessary malicious SQL code.

**Summary:**

The CVE-2007-1250 vulnerability in Angel LMS 7.1 is a serious SQL injection issue allowing unauthenticated attackers to gain complete control over the application database and access highly sensitive data by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests.
