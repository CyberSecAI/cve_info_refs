{
  "CVE-2007-1425": {
    "Description": "The SonicMailer Pro <= 3.2.3 application is vulnerable to a remote blind SQL injection via the 'list' parameter in index.php.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'list' parameter of the 'index.php' page before using it in an SQL query.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain access to sensitive information in the database, including usernames and passwords, by injecting malicious SQL code.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable 'index.php' page, injecting a malicious SQL query in the 'list' parameter."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
    ],
    "Additional details": "The provided exploit code attempts to extract admin usernames and passwords from the database. The exploit uses a 'UNION SELECT' statement to combine the original query result with the result of the crafted malicious SQL query, which concatenates the 'username' and 'password' from the 'smpro_admins' table. The exploit then parses the HTTP response looking for these values."
