Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `default.asp` page of Active Auction Pro 7.1. The `catid` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code via the `catid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database.
- **Information Disclosure:** By manipulating SQL queries, attackers can retrieve sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from the database, as shown in the exploit examples.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  In a severe case, an attacker might be able to modify or delete data, potentially leading to a complete system compromise, although this specific exploit focuses on information retrieval.
- **Administrative Access:** The provided exploit examples retrieve the username and password of the admin, allowing the attacker to log in as admin.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `default.asp` page, with the malicious SQL code injected through the `catid` parameter.
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `catid` parameter in the URL to inject SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** Basic understanding of SQL is required to craft the injection payloads.
- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
