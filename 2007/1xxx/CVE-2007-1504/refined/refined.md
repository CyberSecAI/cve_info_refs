  "CVE-2007-1504": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were discovered in Fujitsu Interstage Application Server. The vulnerabilities reside in the Servlet service and the Servlet service for Interstage Management Console. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to inject arbitrary script code into the user's browser.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerabilities stem from a lack of proper input sanitization in the Servlet services, allowing malicious script code to be injected into web pages.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the user's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerabilities can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts into HTTP requests. These requests are processed by the vulnerable servlet service, resulting in the execution of the script in a user's browser."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable service. This could be achieved by tricking a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised website.",
       "affected_components": [
            "Servlet Service",
            "Servlet Service for Interstage Management Console"
        ]
    },
    "remediation": "Fujitsu released patches to address the vulnerabilities. Users are advised to apply the patches or implement the workarounds provided by the vendor. The workaround involves setting error pages for HTTP status codes 404 and 500 in the web.xml configuration files.",
     "workarounds": "Setting error pages for HTTP status codes 404 and 500 in the Web application environment definition file (deployment descriptor: web.xml) of the vulnerable services."
