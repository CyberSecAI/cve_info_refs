Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-1209:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Windows 32 Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) incorrectly handling its connections during the startup and stopping of processes. Specifically, it is caused by the incorrect marshaling of system resources by the CSRSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Privilege Elevation:** The core vulnerability is a privilege elevation issue, where a local user can gain elevated privileges.
- Incorrect resource handling during process startup and shutdown within CSRSS.
- Incorrect marshaling of system resources.
- Memory resources are not freed appropriately after use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on the affected system.
- **Complete System Control:** With elevated privileges, the attacker could potentially take complete control of the system.
- **Malicious Actions:** This control can lead to actions such as installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the targeted system.
- **Execution of Malicious Program:** The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted program to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker requires a valid user account on the target machine.
- **Local Logon:** The attacker needs the ability to log on locally to the system.
- **Ability to Execute Programs:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a program (the exploit) on the targeted system.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is specific to how CSRSS manages connections during process startup and shutdown, not related to error message handling, which is related to CVE-2006-6696.
- The provided document explicitly states that this vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.
- This vulnerability was reported to Microsoft through responsible disclosure by eEye.

The provided document from Microsoft clarifies that this vulnerability affects Windows Vista, and provides remediation information for that OS and others affected.
