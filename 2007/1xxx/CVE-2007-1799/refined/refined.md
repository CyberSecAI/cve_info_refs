{
  "CVE-2007-1799": {
    "Description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in torrent.cpp in KTorrent before 2.1.3 only checks for the \"..\" string, which allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via modified \"..\" sequences in a torrent filename, as demonstrated by \"../\" sequences, due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-1384.",
    "Root cause": "Incomplete fix for CVE-2007-1384. The application only checked for '..' in file paths and failed to block variations like '../'.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Directory traversal"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can overwrite arbitrary files on the user's system.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted torrent file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious torrent file and convince a user to download it using KTorrent."
