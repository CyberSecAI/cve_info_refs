How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

mod\_perl security update (RHSA-2007-0486, RHSA-2007-0395)

Original Release Date: July 30, 2007

Last Revised: February 27, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-293

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 4.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

Mod\_perl is a Perl interpreter for the Apache web server.

The mod\_perl package was found to contain a Denial of Service (DoS)
condition. If a remote attacker used a carefully crafted URL, it's
possible
that a resource consumption issue could arise, leading to a Denial of
Service
(DoS). The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name
[CVE-2007-1349](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1349) to this issue.

The Risk Level for all Avaya System products have been marked as Low
as
mod\_perl is installed but not actively in use by these products. In
order for
someone to take advantage of these issues, they would already have to
have local
access to the system to change the configuration.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisories issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0486.html>
* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0395.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with mod\_perl installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 2.x, 3.0 | Low | Upgrade to CM 3.1 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | IALX 1.1, 2.0, 2.0SP1 | Low | Upgrade to IALX 2.0 SP2 or later. |
| Avaya EMMC | EMMC 1.017 | Low | This issue will not be addressed as no further releases of EMMC are planned. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.x | Low | Upgrade to MSS 4.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of mod\_perl, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local and
network access to the server. This restriction should be enforced
through the
use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and other
generally-accepted
networking practices until such time as an update becomes available and
can be
installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating
system or applications that come with the operating system. These
vulnerabilities often do not impact the software-only product directly
but may
threaten the integrity of the underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected
by the vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should determine on which Linux operating system the product
was
installed and then follow that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is
installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied
by RedHat Linux.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

RHSA-2008:0630 - Security Advisory

Issued:

# RHSA-2008:0630 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Low: Red Hat Network Satellite Server security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Topic

Red Hat Network Satellite Server version 5.1.1 is now available. This
update includes fixes for a number of security issues in Red Hat Network
Satellite Server components.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

During an internal security audit, it was discovered that Red Hat Network
Satellite Server shipped with an XML-RPC script, manzier.pxt, which had a
single hard-coded authentication key. A remote attacker who is able to
connect to the Satellite Server XML-RPC service could use this flaw to
obtain limited information about Satellite Server users, such as login
names, associated email addresses, internal user IDs, and partial
information about entitlements. (CVE-2008-2369)

This release also corrects several security vulnerabilities in various
components shipped as part of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.1. In a
typical operating environment, these components are not exposed to users
of Satellite Server in a vulnerable manner. These security updates will
reduce risk in unique Satellite Server environments.

A denial-of-service flaw was fixed in mod\_perl. (CVE-2007-1349)

Multiple cross-site scripting flaws were fixed in the image map feature in
the JFreeChart package. (CVE-2007-6306)

A flaw which could result in weak encryption was fixed in the
perl-Crypt-CBC package. (CVE-2006-0898)

Multiple flaws were fixed in the Apache Tomcat package. (CVE-2005-4838,
CVE-2006-0254, CVE-2007-1355, CVE-2007-1358, CVE-2007-2449, CVE-2007-5461,
CVE-2008-0128)

Users of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.1 are advised to upgrade to
5.1.1, which resolves these issues.

## Solution

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/satellite/Red_Hat_Network_Satellite-5.1.0/html/Installation_Guide/s1-maintenance-update.html>

Fix static APACI build on Mac OS X. [Gozer]
Fix XSS vulnerability in Apache::Status reported by
Richard J. Brain, CVE-2009-0796
[Fred Moyer]
On Win32, mod\_perl.h needs to include  before the perl
headers, at least when built with USE\_ITHREADS
[Steve Hay]
Win32 needs PERL\_SYS\_INIT/PERL\_SYS\_TERM calls when built with
USE\_ITHREADS [sic--that's different to USE\_THREADS]. In fact,
they ought to be always called if they are defined
[Steve Hay]
Fix potential segfault when the environment contains
NULL values [Mike Schilli]
Fix static APACI build against newer apache-1.3.38+
[Gozer]
Fixed modules/regex.t test 4 on Win32

SECURITY: CVE-2007-1349 (cve.mitre.org)
fix unescaped variable interpolation in Apache::PerlRun
regular expression to prevent regex engine tampering.
reported by Alex Solovey
[Randal L. Schwartz , Fred Moyer ]
sync Apache-SizeLimit with latest version from CPAN (0.91)
[Philip M. Gollucci, Philippe M. Chiasson]
Fix an Apache::(Registry|PerlRun) bug caused by special characters
in the url [kolya@mail.ru]
Display a more verbose message if Apache.pm can't be loaded
[Geoffrey Young]
Fix incorrect win32 detection in Apache::SizeLimit reported by
Matt Phillips  [Philippe M. Chiasson]
The print-a-scalar-reference feature is now deprecated and documented
as such [Stas]
fix "PerlSetVar Foo 0" so that $r->dir\_config('Foo') returns 0, not undef
[Geoffrey Young]
for some reason .pm files during the modperl build see $ENV{PERL5LIB}
set in Makefile.PL, which is used for generating Makefiles, as
"PERL5LIB=/path:/another/path" instead of "/path:/another/path"
essentially rendering this env var useless. I'm not sure why, may be
MakeMaker kicks in somewhere. Trying to workaround by
s/PERL5LIB/PERL5LIB\_ENV/, using anything that's not PERL5LIB. [Stas]
change $INC{$key} = undef; to delete $INC{$key}; in PerlFreshRestart
[Geoffrey Young]
Fix a bug in Makefile.PL for Win32 where it would, in
certain cases, pick up the wrong Perl include directory
[Steve Hay]
=item 1.29 - Oct 7, 2003
Add a workaround for the 'rand' bug for perl 5.8.1 (compiled with
either -DUSE\_HASH\_SEED or -DUSE\_HASH\_SEED\_EXPLICIT, which is the
default), causing all forked procs to produce the same rand
sequence. [Stas]
For Win32, add an INSTALL\_LIB option to 'perl Makefile.PL' to
allow one to specify where to install mod\_perl.lib. If not
given, this defaults to APACHE\_SRC\libexec, if this exists.
Suggested by Steve Hay [randyk]
Fix t/net/perl/sym.pl (called by modules/symbol) not to affect other
tests (internal/http-get and internal/http-post, which were failing to
call exit) [Stas]
Fix Apache::ExtUtils to work with blead perl (it was breaking the
build) http://rt.perl.org/rt2/Ticket/Display.html?id=23803 [Stas]
On Win32 the uploaded file wasn't cleaned up (weither it's a bug in
CGI.pm or not), make sure we don't leave any dropped files around
[Steve Hay ]
For Win32, keep drive letters in mod\_perl.dsp to fix bug, reported
by DH , when compiling mod\_perl in
cases where Apache and Perl are on different drives [Randy Kobes].
Add workaround to define statcache in Apache.xs so that
one can build on Win32 ActivePerl 8xx with LARGE\_FILES
support [Randy Kobes]
=item 1.28 - July 2, 2003
Apache::FakeRequest now isa Apache so code that is carefull about
$r and checks that $r->isa('Apache') will not fail [David Wheeler
]
Add Win32 support to Apache::SizeLimit [Matt Phillips
 and Mohamed Hendawi ]
Change Apache::SizeLimit to not push a cleanup handler if already in
the cleanup handler phase, and adjust docs to show that cleanup
handler is the preferred phase to use [Perrin Harkins
]
Rename Apache::test to Apache::testold because Apache::test on
case-insensitive systems will collide with Apache::Test which
supercedes Apache::test. So if you want to keep on using Apache::test,
either bundle it with your project (putting it under inc/ or t/ so it
won't be installed) or require mod\_perl 1.28 and use Apache::testold
instead. Of course the best route is to port your test suite to use
a much better Apache::Test which work with mod\_perl 1.0 and 2.0.
[Philippe M. Chiasson, Stas Bekman]
Tweak mod\_perl.h to defined \_INCLUDE\_APACHE\_FIRST only after apache
headers were included [Stas Bekman]

STRLEN to Apache/typemap
- add I32 typecast in Constants.xs
- avoid use of unregistered local variables for Win32
in mod\_perl.c and perl\_config.c
- s/I32/U8/ in mod\_perl.h, perl\_config.c, and perl\_util.c
- declare i and http\_code to be STRLEN in perl\_util.c
[Stas Bekman, Randy Kobes]
don't use $r variable in Apache::PerlRun::compile(), so the script
won't use use inherited $r by mistake [Stas Bekman]
define PERL\_DIRECTIVE\_HANDLERS so that ModuleConfig.c gets
generated when building on Win32 within Visual Studio
[John Petrakis ]
enable PERL\_SECTIONS for Win32 [Dirk Maetens ]
use touch() from ExtUtils::Command, rather than a system touch(),
for the benefit of platforms without touch(). [Randy Kobes
]
can't let the default typemap rule to convert sv into char\* in
unescape\_url, since it doesn't handle correctly undefs (returns an
unallocated "" string, which then causes a segfault in
ap\_unescape\_url. use SvPV\_force, instead, which does the right
thing. [Stas Bekman]
Make sure to start perl, if it's not running, before processing Perl\*
directives, with threaded perl and PERL\_STACKED\_HANDLERS=0 [Stas
Bekman]
Add Apache::Module to Bundle::Apache [Stas Bekman]

Makefile.PL's PREFIX option correctly [Philippe M. Chiasson
]
prevent segfaults in mod\_perl\_mark\_where() when a sub can't get
resolved [Gerald Richter ]

need and apache won't compile with [Stas Bekman ]
make sure PerlSetEnv variables are visible after first access
to each child [Geoff Young ]
workaround Apache::Constants::AUTOLOAD problem with bleedperl
the first flag argument to perl cannot start with space, since perl tries
to open the " -spi.bak" as a file. fix that in the win32 case.
[Stas Bekman ]
starting from perl 5.7.3 for tied filehandles, tiedscalar magic is applied
to the IO slot of the GP rather than the GV itself. adjust the TIEHANDLE
macro to work properly under 5.7.3+. [Charles Jardine ,
Stas Bekman ]

thanks to spot by Ryan A. Whelan
fix tied $r->err\_headers\_out cut-n-pasto [Peter Kaas ]
Apache::read\_client\_block will now use safemalloc/safefree, rather
than palloc, so memory is released after each read(), rather than at
the end of a request. (e.g. so file uploads don't cause too much growth)
Added mod\_perl\_method\_handlers.pod file, a little article about using
perl objects with modperl. [ ask@netcetera.dk ]
Apache::Registry will now save END blocks just after the script is compiled,
instead of after the subroutine call. otherwise, if the client breaks the
connection, the hard\_timeout will jump out of perl\_handler(), and the save
will never happen. Thanks to Robert Nice and Ben Laurie for spotting this.
bug fix so PATH\_INFO is properly reset, thanks to David Sklar for the spot

added additional installation document INSTALL.apaci which
describes the new APACI stuff (including background information).
[Ralf S. Engelschall ]
added new (but still optional!) Apache 1.3 support via the new Apache
Autoconf-style Interface (APACI): The option USE\_APACI=1 triggers a new
build-environment (from local apaci/) for the APACHE\_SRC/src/modules/perl/
which provides a clean way (i.e. without patching anything inside APACHE\_SRC,
not even the Configuration file) of configuring mod\_perl via a
APACHE\_SRC/src/modules/perl/mod\_perl.config file. The completey configuration
is enabled by just using the APACI command "configure
--activate-module=src/modules/perl/libperl.a"
[Ralf S. Engelschall ]
experimental tie of $0 to Apache->request->filename, enable with
-DPERL\_TIE\_SCRIPTNAME
added little Apache::system that redirects output to the browser,
should this be imported into Apache::{Registry,PerlRun} scripts?
new Apache::Tie module, provides Apache::TieHashTable for a proper
interface to Apache table structures. The following methods, called
in a scalar context with no "key" argument, will return a HASH
reference, where HASH is tied to Apache::TieHashTable:
headers\_in, headers\_out, err\_headers\_out, notes, dir\_config, subprocess\_env
enable with PERL\_TIE\_TABLES=1

add $ServerRoot/lib/perl to @INC at startup
add code to deal with 1.3b7-dev's SERVER\_SUBVERSION replacement
a few doc patches [John D Groenveld ]
re-implemented $r->read to properly use \*client\_block methods and call
reset\_timeout after each read in the loop. until this is well tested,
the method is called new\_read. to test on tie'd STDIN reads, a startup
script can say this:
\*Apache::READ = \&Apache::new\_read;
added setup\_client\_block, should\_client\_block and get\_client\_block
methods
modules/cgi test will attempt a fileupload of perlfunc.pod to
file\_upload.cgi if HTTP::Request::Common is installed
(libwww-perl-5.09+) and $CGI::VERSION >= 2.39

change Apache.xs/typemap so classes who inherit from the Apache class
can invoke methods with a hash object, provided $hash->{\_r} contains a
request\_rec object
additions to experimental Perl directive support:
- a per-directory config object is now passed as the first argument
to directive handlers registered via Apache::ExtUtils->xs\_cmd\_table
the object is a hash reference blessed into the same class as the handler
- $r->dir\_config with no args now looks for per-directory config in
the caller's namespace
- xs\_cmd\_table now looks for a prototype to determine TAKE1,
TAKE2, TAKE3, etc.

for testing and suggestions.
PERL\_OBJECT\_HANDLERS now enabled #ifdef PERL\_METHOD\_HANDLERS
widen scope of mutex lock under win32 to avoid possible deadlock
[Gerald Richter ]
fixed bug in directory\_merge where FLAG directives would inherit `On'
from the base configuration, even if the directory explicitly had the

- now that packages are links, no longer do recursive dump
(recurse yourself via hyperlinks, much easier to read!!!)
- hashes, scalars and arrays are now links,
click, Data::Dumper Dump (only if PerlSetVar StatusDumper is On)
- functions are now links, click, subroutine info (requires the B module)
- dump of any type also has a link "Peek Dump"
(only if PerlSetVar StatusPeek is On and Apache::Peek is installed)
- dump of any type also has a link "OP Tree Graph"
(only if PerlSetVar StatusGraph is On)
(requires the B and B::Graph modules and the dot program)
- added t/modules/status test
with the -DPERL\_MARK\_WHERE experimental feature enabled, there's a
chance you'll never see "Use of uninitialized value." again without
some more useful information, nor will you see '-e' reported outside
of Apache::Registry
perl\_destruct\_level can now be set via the environment variable
PERL\_DESTRUCT\_LEVEL or -DPERL\_DESTRUCT\_LEVEL
turn default perl\_destruct\_level down from 2 to Perl's default of 0
use a copy of apache's ap\_cpystrn against versions < 1.3b4-dev
got rid of "Use of uninitialized value." warning in perl\_util.c seen
when running HTML::Embperl, hunted down by Todd Eigenschink and Gerald
Richter
added modules/src test for Apache::src
documented Apache::src
the Apache::src->new method will now default to the first
auto/Apache/include directory found relative to @INC

$(INST\_ARCHLIB)/auto/Apache/include
fix $Apache::ServerStarting bug that broke 'make test' w/ ApacheSSL
and Stronghold spotted by Vivek Khera
remove the need for File::Copy's mv() function, since it can't seem to
decide if it has one or not
\_03's new tests assumed PerlCleanupHandler was enabled, fixed now
thanks to spot by Rob Hartill
Makefile.PL will now chmod a+x t/net/perl/\* t/net/perl/io/\*
thanks to Rob Hartill
experimental features can be enabled with -DDEFINEs instead of
$variables or %ENV, changes to Makefile.PL make them simple to add,
see eg/makepl\_args.mod\_perl for even simpler
added eg/makepl\_args.mod\_perl
the makepl\_args.mod\_perl can now have multiple lines, space, #comments
and empty newlines are ignored, stops reading if it hits \_\_END\_\_
Makefile.PL will now also look for $ENV{HOME}/.makepl\_args.mod\_perl
and read in if exists
before clearing handlers stacked via Apache->push\_handlers at the end
of each request, save the PerlChildExitHandler stack and putback after
the clear. this way, modules pulled in at server startup can say:
Apache->push\_handlers(PerlChildExitHandler => sub {})
a "top-level" mod\_perl per-directory directive would cause core dump
inside  sections. now trap that and exit with message that the
directive should be inside a containter e.g. %Location, %VirtualHost
(not sure what the real problem is here)
re-work PERL\_SECTIONS\_SELF\_BOOT stuff so it calls perl\_section() directly,
rather than perl\_eat\_config\_string("\n"), because:
- it no longer core dumps when a "top-level" per-server directive is found
- it no longer requires 1.3b3+ (1.2.x will work)
- it is faster
PerlModule/PERL\_SECTIONS\_SELF\_BOOT will delete $INC{$PerlModule} on
the first config read pass, so it's re-read on the second pass
if ($] < 5.004\_04) Makefile.PL will warn that users should upgrade to
5.004\_04 or higher
removed Apache::PerlSections' self test now that we have
modules/psections.t and it won't work without the =pod line.

the error\_log as it should, spotted by Vivek Khera and Paul Phillips
fixed corrupted $ENV{TZ} spotted by Michael Parker
cut out 'make test' error\_log noise, anything there now should only be
an error or a non-error [notice]

(s/,/ /g) which are added to EXTRA\_CFLAGS
e.g.:
PERL\_EXTRA\_CFLAGS=-DFOO=1,-DBAR=2
if the file `makepl\_args.modperl' is present in . or .. it will be read into
@ARGV, e.g. might contain EVERYTHING=1 DO\_HTTPD=1
fixes for 1.3b4-dev compat
- get rid of AuthName space in generated .htaccess file for
internal/hooks test
if a PerlModule defines something in %Apache::ReadConfig
sections are run without need to actually have  in
httpd.conf, i.e. httpd.conf could be nothing more than:
PerlModule Apache::httpd\_conf
whilst experimental, enable by setting the envrionment variable
PERL\_SECTIONS\_SELF\_BOOT to something true
experimental feature, modules can 'exit|die AUTH\_REQUIRED;' or with
any HTTP error code and that response is sent rather than SERVER\_ERROR
to test enable by setting $Apache::ERRSV\_CAN\_BE\_HTTP = 1
take CGI.pm version check out of Apache::Registry, now that we require
5.004+, they'll have at least 2.36
get rid of "Use of uninitialized value at -e line 65535" warning
caused by perl\_run\_rgy\_endav() spotted by Doug Bagley

($conf->server\_start calls this by default)
- when httpd.conf is written, set BaseDir in a BEGIN block
- drop trailing slash from Alias'
- fix write() method's assignment of %$self to \*Apache::ReadConfig::

Apache::SIG->set is now called at server startup by default
applied patch from Doug Bagley to stop possible infininite loop in

sure from now on!)
applied patches from Peter Tillemans so we can run the test suite
under win32
applied win32 patches from Peter Tillemans so perl\_handler() is mutex
locked and to cut out Makefile.PL attempt to symlink the eg directory
Apache::test will define the bootstrap method for Apache and
Apache::Constants to quiet 'make test' noize spotted by Andreas
=item 1.05 - 11/06/97
no longer include $r->server->server\_name as part of the
Apache::Registry uri->package name translation by default. if you
\*really\* need this to happen set this in PerlScript:
$Apache::Registry::NameWithVirtualHost = 1;
and, please tell me why you need it, we'll figure out a better way
yanked DeleteINC thingy from StatINC

renamed 'core' test directory to 'internal'
remove t/TEST's search for obsolete directories, which caused trouble
on IRIX 6, spotted by Lasse Petersen
for internal redirects (spotted by $r->cgi\_header\_out), don't
perl\_call\_halt(), instead, tie STDOUT to the Apache::FakeRequest class
which just soaks up print() output.
suggestion from Salvador Ortiz, for table methods, if value is
undef, call table\_unset underneath, these methods are subprocess\_env,
header\_in, header\_out, err\_header\_out, notes and dir\_config. e.g.:
$r->header\_out("Content-length" => undef);
ensure constant subroutine re-definition warnings are surpressed
during restart (when PerlFreshRestart On), spotted by Vivek Khera

as suggested by Mike Fletcher
fixed typo bug in Apache::Status spotted by Brian Tiemann
=item 1.04 - 10/30/97
PerlScript and -Mmod\_perl are no longer handed to perl\_parse(),
instead perl\_parse() gets a -e to set $ENV{MOD\_PERL} and
$ENV{GATEWAY\_INTERFACE} (and possibly other switches -T, -w)
PerlScript is pulled in via 'do $PerlScript';
applied patch from Ron Hawkins to fix bug in perl\_setup\_env() when
running with Stronghold in secure mode
added Apache::PerlSections module, currently with one method: dump()
for use in  sections, PerlScript and PerlModules, can now say
'my $s = Apache->server' during server startup, which returns a
server\_rec\* blessed into the Apache::Server class just as $r->server
does during request time.
Apache::Server class can now warn() and log\_error()
avoid using LWP::Simple so we don't get caught up on HTTP\_PROXY which
was cause 'make test' to fail several tests for some people.
thanks to Philippe Froidevaux, Tom Hughes and Frank Cringle
added some 3rd-party tests for Apache::Stage and Apache::Sandwich
added Apache::test module
back out support for internal redirects, caused big problems with

everything works properly, e.g. Action or a mod\_include'd #perl
thanks to Peter Levart and Scott Holdren for spotting this
=item 1.03 - 10/23/97
configure/build/INSTALL enhancements with much help from Bowen Dwelle:
- to use an apache Configuration file that mod\_perl will not edit:
perl Makefile.PL CONFIG=Configuration.custom
- perl Makefile.PL DYNAMIC=1 ALL\_HOOKS=1 ...
Configure mod\_perl with ../apache\_1.2.4/src ? [y]
Shall I build httpd in ../apache\_1.2.4/src for you? [y] n
now, $APACHE\_SRC/modules/perl/Makefile will be enabled with those hooks
- to aid EXTRA\_CFLAGS when building by hand or using a custom
Configuration file: `perl -Mmod\_perl -e subversion` prints:
SERVER\_SUBVERSION=\"mod\_perl/$mod\_perl::VERSION\"
- fixed up INSTALL quite a bit
added $r->post\_connection alias for $r->cleanup\_handler
if 1.3b2+, drop log\_error(), use new aplog\_error() instead (everywhere)

removed Apache->request depreciation warning
added redirect.t test to test remote redirect and internal redirects
fixed internal re-direction handling of Location: /local/file.html
removed several eg/ scripts that were "ports" of CGI.pm-x.xx/examples
now that CGI.pm runs solid under mod\_perl and mod\_perl requires
5.004+, there's no need for $r->print and CGI::Switch, so those
examples don't need "porting"
force 'PerlSendHeader On' for sub-requests, e.g. Apache::Sandwich
so headers don't show up in the browser
fixed PerlSendHeader bug with virtual includes spotted by Scott Holdren
make lib/mod\_perl.pm -> mod\_perl.pm symlink (for 'make test') relative,
suggested by Bowen Dwelle
applied patch from Andreas to add a new $r->subprocess\_env method
fixed Apache::StatINC brokeness spotted by Bowen Dwelle and applied a
StatINC doc patch from him too

restarting httpd ala kill -HUP will now reload all modules and flush
the Apache::Registry cache
(must set 'PerlFreshRestart On' in httpd.conf for this to work)
=item 1.02 - 10/17/97
have Makefile.PL edit t/net/perl/cgi.pl's #! line to fix perl location
thanks to Frank Cringle for spotting this
=item 1.01 - 10/16/97
removed undocumented auto-import of qw(OK DECLINED) use to short-cut
Perl\*Handlers and/or apache C handlers, use Apache::OK and
Apache::DECLINED instead
start perl interpreter with -Mmod\_perl so \_every\_ module no matter
where it's loaded from will see $ENV{GATEWAY\_INTERFACE} and $ENV{MOD\_PERL}
Thanks to Mark Dedlow for illustrating this need with Apache::DBI and friends.
 section %Hash values of hash refs now go through
perl\_handle\_command\_hv(), so `Location' can be inside %VirtualHost,
etc. Thanks to Ask Hansen for spotting this.
 section %Hash values of array refs now go though
perl\_handle\_command\_av(), so proper action is used on TAKE1, etc.
if Tie::IxHash is available, tie  section %Hashes to it, so the
apache config routines get info in the order it needs to. Thanks to
Rob Hartill and Dean Gaudet for explaining this need for 1.3bx's
new virtual host features
include the mod\_perl logo image (mod\_perl.gif)
ensure \_all\_ stacked handlers registered with $r->push\_handlers() are
cleared after each request to fix bug spotted by Peter Lister
test suite will now delete $ENV{HTTP\_PROXY} before running,
thanks to Frank Cringle

1.3b1 stuff:
-cat apache\_x.x.x/src/Makefile.config and src/modules/perl/Makefile
together so we get $(INCLUDES) (for os/unix, etc)
applied patch from Salvador Ortiz so calling $r->args in an
array context will not produce "Odd number of elements in hash list"

remove Apache->send\_cgi\_header's broken internal re-direct handling
spotted by Debby Fu
added Frank Cringle's mod\_perl FAQ
added mod\_perl\_tuning.pod document from Vivek Khera

'PerlSetVar MaxModPerlRequestsPerChild 10' behaves like
MaxRequestsPerChild, but counts mod\_perl requests only. 1.3b1-dev+ is
needed for this
=item 1.00\_03 - 09/21/97

if PerlSendHeader is On, the environment variable PERL\_SEND\_HEADER is
set to `On'
=item 1.00\_02 - 09/15/97
1.3b1 stuff:
- $r->warn and $r->log\_error go through new aplog\_error() function.
If `LogLevel' is not set to `warn' or higher, $r->warn messages are
ignored (not sent to error\_log).
(i.e. $r->warn == APLOG\_WARNING, $r->log\_error == APLOG\_ERR)
- always enable child\_init/child\_exit
+ use child\_init for perl\_init\_ids()
+ use child\_exit to:
-run END blocks suspended at server startup

substr() instead of .=
Apache->seqno will no longer dig into scoreboard info for rec.my\_access\_count
the seqno method was originally introduced for CGI.pm, which now uses
$r->register\_cleanup instead. It was never documented in Apache.pm,
does anyone actually use Apache->seqno?
perl\_section() will call perl\_startup() if Perl's not running already,
as suggested by Rob Hartill
included t/conf/httpd.conf.pl for testing , which can replace
t/conf/httpd.conf if you've configured with PERL\_SECTIONS=1

mod\_perl now requires Perl version 5.004 or higher
hookup STDERR to error\_log first chance we get (first Perl\*Handler
that's called)
$r->warn and $r->log\_error will now join @\_ and log one string instead
of calling log\_error foreach @\_, suggested by Joel Wagner
PerlScript may now be relative to ServerRoot
remove UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD from Apache::Debug (more trouble than help!)
make sent\_header variable per-directory instead of global
added $r->bytes\_sent method suggested by Maurice Aubrey
along with code from Nathan Torkington to make sure we get it right as
mod\_log\_common does
added fix to Apache::Include from Randal Schwartz so $r->uri is
properly reset
SetEnv PERL5LIB will now work on a per-directory basis thanks to spot
by Vivek Khera

modified apache\*/src directories first
now suspend all END blocks encountered during server startup and run
them during server shutdown aka child\_exit (need 1.3b1+)
now execute END blocks of PerlHandler (Apache::Registry) scripts at
the expected time
make sure CGI.pm version 2.36 or higher is being used
make sure GATEWAY\_INTERFACE is not cleared from %ENV so
Apache::DBI/ApacheAuthenDBI work together, thanks to spot by
John Groenveld
some source re-org: split stuff into perl\_util.c and perlio.c,
rename config.c -> perl\_config.c, various cleanups
the constants.t test is now run under httpd with t/net/constants.pl
Apache::Constants not longer defines subs at startup. we now use a C
AUTOLOAD which creates newSUBs when needed, without eval {} and
without "prototype mismatch" errors. This shrunk my httpd image size
by ~50K
according to Joel Wagner, Solaris's tar did not like the trailing / on
the Apache/ argument to the tar\_Apache target in Makefile. gone now.
thanks to help from Vern Hart, Apache::Registry will now include

constants from httpd.h, :methods import tag and some cleanups
applied Makefile.PL patch from Andreas Koenig adding verbosity
if there's a problem with t/report
PerlNewSendHeader functionality has replaced PerlSendHeader's
the `PerlNewSendHeader' directive is gone, replace with `PerlSendHeader'
fixed Apache::exit so it no longer calls C-level exit (unless exit
code == -2), it now just terminates the perl callback, without
producing an "Internal Server Error" therefor, we complete \_all\_
post-handler request phases and no longer dump core, as some have seen
under certain conditions. the test suite nows tests calling exit()
applied patch from Brian Millett to Makefile, so SSL\_CFLAGS are used
with Ben-SSL
=item 1.00 - 07/28/97

added new sub request methods:
- lookup\_uri (sub\_req\_lookup\_uri)
- lookup\_file (sub\_req\_lookup\_file)
The returned request\_rec \* is blessed into the `Apache::SubRequest'
class so destroy\_sub\_req() is called automatically during DESTROY
- the run\_sub\_req() function is available in this class as the run() method

PerlScript, thanks to Tom Hughes for spotting this
removed trick to make `require Apache::TieHandle' a noop, \*nobody\*
should still have that in any code, if so, sorry, get rid of it!
inspired by Pai-Ling Hsiao, added tiny Apache::Include module so the
mod\_include <--!#perl directive can take advantage of
Apache::Registry, like so:

added $r->translate\_name method to run translate handlers
fix Apache::Status so it sends http headers! spotted by Mike Stok

$Location{"/~dougm/"} = {
AuthUserFile => '/tmp/htpasswd',
AuthType => 'Basic',
AuthName => 'Homepage',
Limit => {
METHODS => 'GET POST',
require => 'user dougm',
},
};
- `PerlModule' configuration directive
set $SIG{PIPE} = 'IGNORE'; when the server starts to avoid hosing when:
`Apache->print lost connection to client'
thanks to Aaron Flin for the tip
=item 0.98\_03 - 05/19/97
construct Perl interperter the first time perl\_startup is called
rather than the second:
-slapped self upside head wondering why I did not do this before

- sections work again
-ugly avoid\_first\_alloc\_hack is gone!
added `ENVIRONMENT' section to mod\_perl.pod

mod\_cgi does (e.g. Set-Cookie bug spotted by Jonathan Lieberman)
=item 0.98\_01

in the future, this can be used to pass arguments to Perl\*Handlers:
PerlHandlerArgs Package::sub\_name OneArg TwoArg RedArg BlueArg
split out some config routines from mod\_perl.c to config.c
fixed bug in Apache/Makefile.PL thanks to Jeff Rowe
now use translate slot to do some initialization
Perl\*Handlers can now be anonymous subs (need 5.003\_98+), e.g.:
PerlFixupHandler "sub { shift->header\_out(Key => 'val') }"
finally get cleanups right:
- PerlCleanupHandler is now run during PerlLogHandler
- new method $r->register\_cleanup uses register\_cleanup
underneath and is always available
@INC is now reset to default after each request
fixed "const char \*" bug in typemap spotted by Honza Pazdziora
=item 0.98 - 05/02/97
save a pointer to request\_rec in the translate stage so we always have one

added documentation for stacked handlers and a little for method handlers.
$^X is now set to server\_argv0 as suggested by Frank Cringle
Apache::Registry will now require CGI.pm version 2.35 or higher if you
are using it. Makefile.PL will also test and warn if it is < 2.35
removed examplish modules from the distribution into the contrib directory:
AuthzAge.pm, AccessLimitNum.pm, MsqlProxy.pm, SSI.pm
the contrib directory will be tar'd and uploaded to CPAN when updated.
added headers.t test for Perl(New)SendHeader
added option to link httpd with static Apache.o (the original way),
(Eric Bartley reported problems on aix with Apache.so, others?)
like so: perl Makefile.PL STATIC=1
only bother setting $$ once per-child
%ENV is now cleared by a registered cleanup function, rather than
after PerlHandler is called
applied patch from Andreas to ensure APACHE\_SSL is defined if
we're configuring with it
putback -DSERVER\_SUBVERSION now that netscape workaround is in 1.2b9
PerlNewSendHeader enhancement so headers don't need to be part of
a single print statement.
applied fix from Rob Hartill so Makefile.PL can parse beta version >= 10!
properly initialize cld->new\_sendheader thanks to Rob Hartill
$r->print is now an xsub for speedup, even with the new
extra operation of checking $|, it's faster:
Benchmark: timing 100 iterations of 0.97\_01, 0.97\_02...
0.97\_01: 9 secs ( 2.03 usr 0.19 sys = 2.22 cpu)
0.97\_02: 8 secs ( 1.84 usr 0.17 sys = 2.01 cpu)
sfapachewrite() will now call Apache->print
if $| is non-zero, call rflush() after writing to the client
$| is reset to 0 before PerlHandler is called
applied patch from Eric Bartley to:
-add get\_remote\_logname() method
-update Apache.pm documentation including:
get\_remote\_logname, auth\_type, auth\_name, document\_root, notes
fix so $r->rflush works with older apache's
=item 0.97\_01 - 04/22/97
added experimental `PerlNewSendHeader' config directive
works like `PerlSendHeader', but scans headers for special
headers like Location:, Status:, etc.
simply uses a C global variable `sent\_header', if true, sends
data asis to client, otherwise calls $r->send\_cgi\_header
currently, does not work with sfio (yet) and this only works if a
single print statement sends the headers like so:
print "Status: 302\n",
"Location: http://www.somewhere.com/\n",
"Content-type: text/html\n\n";
"fixed" new preg\* clashes w/ 1.2b9-dev spotted by Dean Gaudet
reworked callback mechanism a bit:
- folded duplicate code in run\_stacked\_handlers() + perl\_call()

- perl\_handler\_ismethod now() uses class stash in gv\_fetchmethod
- cache CV from perl\_get\_cv lookup if -DPERL\_STACKED\_HANDLERS

PerlCleanupHandler now uses register\_cleanup underneath,
instead of abusing the logger slot.
PerlCleanupHandler is enabled by default
added PRINTF for tie'd STDOUT
detached Apache.o from httpd, now a dynamic extension. here's why:
- shinks httpd size
- possible to 'use Apache ()' outside of httpd
(very few methods will work though!)
- once mod\_perl.c settles it will be possible to upgrade mod\_perl
without rebuilding httpd!
added $r->server\_root\_relative function
Apache::Status has 2 new menu items (need Devel::Symdump 1.99\_01+):

introduced experimental "stacked handlers" mechanism, allowing more
than one Perl\*Handler to be defined and run during each stage of the
request.
Perl\*Handler directives can now define any number of subroutines, e.g.
PerlTransHandler OneTrans TwoTrans RedTrans BlueTrans
with a new method, Apache->push\_handlers can add to the stack by
scripts at runtime
PerlLogHandler enabled by default during "stacked handlers" experiment

needed. however, scripts that are currently using:
use Apache:TieHandle ();
tie \*STDOUT => "Apache::TieHandle";

which is an alias for Apache::log\_error
Apache::exit now overrides CORE::exit in Apache::Registry scripts,
now converted CGI scripts can safely call plain 'ol exit;

User and Group with uid and gid of the current process
updated Makefile.tmpl-1.2 with Makefile.tmpl from apache 1.2b2
if Makefile.PL finds apache version >= 1.2b3, instead of copying
Makefile.tmpl to ../src/apache\_x.x, it uses the new '-make Makefile.tmpl'
option, made possible by Rob Hartill
otherwise, same as before and it now tells you it's made a backup
'Makefile.tmpl.bak'
fixed 'make test', so you \_really\_ don't have to modify anything,
hopefully
if libwww-perl is not installed, the tests that require it will not be run,
and it will be suggested that you install the library, but who doesn't
have libwww-perl installed???
=item 0.85\_06
same as 0.85\_05, just fixed broken tarball
=item 0.85\_05
fixed Makefile.PL bug spotted by Gary Shea
applied XA.pm fix from Edmund Mergl
updated docs and examples here and there
'make test' improved, all uneeded directives and files stripped out,
should be able to run with no modification, nothing by hand other than
'make test'

build Perl, thanks to Andreas
added 'make offsite-tar' target for build the perl-side on machines
without apache source
fixed Makefile.tmpl\* so people define EXTRA\_FLAGS as suggested by Rob Hartill
a few minor fixes for Apache-SSL users
=item 0.85\_04
applied patch from Rob Hartill to fix bug in $r->cgi\_env
%ENV is cleared after each callback (&Perl\*Handler)
added $r->cgi\_var as suggested by Andreas:
calls $r->cgi\_env($key) in a scalar context to prevent the
mistake of calling in a list context.
if a Perl\*Handler returns something > 600 we assume OK (for now)
bug fixed introduced in 0.85\_03 for Perl\*Handler's not prefixed with
a Package:: causing httpd to sigsegv
ship with Makefile.tmpl-Ben-SSL for Apache-SSL users
Makefile.PL a little smarter
-knows if we're configuring with Ben-SSL, uses Makefile.tmpl-Ben-SSL
-after looking for 1.1.1 and 1.2\*, globs for  not
-instead of rm -rf'ing the modules/perl/ directory we're configuring
against, we only rm -f those found in our MANIFEST
applied patch from Frank Cringle  to fix defaults
in CGI::XA
got rid of stupid warning "missing test.pl"
=item 0.85\_03
cleaned up internal perl\_setup\_env()

so there is no need to specify PerlModule
added Apache::Status module
$r->print now sets a hard\_timeout() before sending to the client
$r->read now sets a hard\_timeout() before reading from the client

Apache::DBIAuthen renamed Apache::AuthenDBI and split out from
Apache::Authen
Apache::Authen->handler renamed Apache::Authen->check
as it is not a handler, only used by handlers
added ToDo file
updated UserGuide, now called 'mod\_perl.pod'
updated INSTALL and README docs
perl\_init will only perl\_alloc and perl\_contstruct once when the server
starts, meaning no more mad leaks when server is restarted
modified test suite adding extra tests for sfio and TIEHANDLE
unless Perl was configured to use perlio and sfio, STDOUT is tied by default to
the client, no more need for tie \*STDOUT => Apache::TieHandle
Makefile.PL now looks for ../apache\_1.1.1/src/, apache\_1.2\*/src/ to configure
against
Fixed Makefile.PL bug spotted by Frank Cringle ,
when no apache source was present or chosen to configure against
'make clean' will now cd $(APACHE\_SRC) && $(MAKE) clean

The new $r->read implementation is based on patches and ideas from
Milan Votava ,
Joonsuk Bae ,
and Gisle
=item 0.85\_01
added 'tar\_Apache' target for copying the perl-side of mod\_perl to other
machines without dragging the apache-side along.

=item 0.83\_10
send\_cgi\_header now sets $r->status to REDIRECT when it finds a Location
header which is not an internal redirect
Apache::Registry now returns $r->status rather than always OK
dropped old approach of the original mod\_perl.c, mod\_perl\_fast functionality
has moved to the all-knowing, all-doing mod\_perl
Makefile.PL for Apache::Constants looks for httpd.h in ../../apache\*/src/
before prompting
dropped OK from @{$Apache::Constants::EXPORT\_TAGS{response\_codes}}

applied Makefile.PL patch from Gisle to set PERL= in Makefile\*
=item 0.83\_09
fixed bug with get\_basic\_auth\_pw spotted by Patrick Kane
=item 0.83\_08
get\_basic\_auth\_pw now returns the $send\_pw, rather that setting it,
see Apache.pm docs
applied patch from Andreas with the following changes:
1) regex directory added in Constants/Makefile.PL. Current apache
always needs -Iregex, that means for us an additional
-I$httpd/regex. I think, they should
#include
2) Assorted comments added to INSTALL, especially
\* FileHandle bug explained as being a 5.003 bug (not "current")
\* Configuration/Configuration.tmpl relation explained
\* && instead of ; to separate commands is a must in Makefiles
\* Gisle's hint about the default seems very important to me, so is
there again.
3) Drops the deprecated mod\_alias patch from the whole distribution
4) A whitespace patch for src/modules/perl/Makefile
5) The regex directory also for src/modules/perl/Makefile
6) Shuffling of code between mod\_perl\_fast.c and mod\_perl.h until it
fits the bill, who knows why :-0

added callback hooks for authorization, access, type-check,
fixup and logger stages of the request
callback hooks can now be turned off at compile time with
-DNO\_PERL\_...., and are turned off by default, except for the
handler stage (PerlHandler)
reworked installation procedure to follow apache 1.2 recomendations,
the procedure will still work with older versions of apache.
No more Makefile.tmpl.x.x.x mess!!
updated #if MODULE\_MAGIC\_NUMBERS >='s so we're inline with apache 1.2-dev-19961009130008
=item 0.83\_03
Perl\*Handler's are now called with Apache->request as an argument
PerlHandler's may still ask for Apache->request so existing code and
mechanisms such as Apache::Registry will continue to work
However, other handlers such as PerlAuthenHandler and PerlTransHandler,
cannot use Apache->request.
added Apache::Constants module, based on patch to Apache.xs
from Gisle
updated Apache::Debug with patch from Gisle to
- update the status codes from the latest

the standard perl distribution as of 5.003\_01
=item release 0.71b1 - July 19, 1996
added PERL\_CCFLAGS to Makefile.tmpl as suggested by
Lincoln Stein
subroutines no longer need to return '0' for OK status, 200 and 1

| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-03-29 14:24:40 UTC  ``` Description: A vulnerability has been reported in mod_perl, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).    The vulnerability is caused due to a regular expression in "RegistryCooker.pm" (mod_perl 2.x) or "PerlRun.pm" (mod_perl 1.x) that uses the "path_info" variable without properly escaping it. This can be exploited to cause a DoS by sending requests with specially crafted URLs to a vulnerable server.  Solution: Fixed in the SVN repository.

# Apache mod\_perl: Denial of service — GLSA **200705-04**

The mod\_perl Apache module is vulnerable to a Denial of Service when
processing regular expressions.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apache/mod\_perl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.3-r1**revision >= **1.30** |

### Background

Mod\_perl is an Apache module that embeds the Perl interpreter within
the server, allowing Perl-based web-applications to be created.

### Description

Alex Solvey discovered that the "path\_info" variable used in file
RegistryCooker.pm (mod\_perl 2.x) or file PerlRun.pm (mod\_perl 1.x), is
not properly escaped before being processed.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted URL to the vulnerable
server, possibly resulting in a massive resource consumption.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All mod\_perl 1.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apache/mod_perl-1.30"
```

All mod\_perl 2.x users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apache/mod_perl-2.0.3-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-488-1: mod\_perl vulnerability

18 July 2007

mod\_perl vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Alex Solovey discovered that mod\_perl did not correctly validate certain

regular expression matches. A remote attacker could send a specially

crafted request to a web application using mod\_perl, causing the web

server to monopolize CPU resources. This could lead to a remote denial

of service.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=244803#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-06-19 09:51:41 UTC  ``` "Web pages that display the Accept-Language header value sent by the client are susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack if they assume the Accept-Language header value conforms to RFC 2616. Under normal circumstances this would not be possible to exploit, however older versions of Flash player were known to allow carefully crafted malicious Flash files to make requests with such custom headers. Tomcat now ignores invalid values for Accept-Language headers that do not conform to RFC 2616."  Therefore impact=low  "This flaw is actually an issue in the container getLocale() method and not  in Struts itself.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2007:0395 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Low: mod\_perl security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0395)

## Topic

Updated mod\_perl packages that fix a security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

Mod\_perl incorporates a Perl interpreter into the Apache web server,
so that the Apache web server can directly execute Perl code.

An issue was found in the "namespace\_from\_uri" method of the
ModPerl::RegistryCooker class. If a server implemented a mod\_perl registry
module using this method, a remote attacker requesting a carefully crafted
URI can cause resource consumption, which could lead to a denial of service
(CVE-2007-1349).

Users of mod\_perl should update to these erratum packages which contain a
backported fix to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
