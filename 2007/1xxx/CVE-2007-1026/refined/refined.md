Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `album` parameter of the XLAtunes 0.1 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query. Specifically, the `album` parameter is directly used in a query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Exposure:** Attackers can use the SQL injection vulnerability to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application's database.
- **Data Exfiltration:**  Through the crafted SQL queries, attackers can extract sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, from the database. The provided exploit example specifically targets the `config` table to extract configuration details, including the username and password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes the SQL injection payload in the `album` parameter, for instance,  `http://host.com/path/?mode=view&album=-1%20UNION%20SELECT%20confkey%20FROM%20config/*`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable XLAtunes application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the injection payload.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit was found by Bl0od3r on February 17, 2007.
- The vulnerable application is XLAtunes 0.1, which can be downloaded from http://www.scriptdungeon.com/script.php?ScriptID=2844.
- The provided exploit example demonstrates how to extract the `confkey` column from the `config` table, which contains sensitive information such as the application's username and password.
