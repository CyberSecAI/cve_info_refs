{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an insecure inclusion of the 'func.inc.php' file within the 'addressbook.php' script. The 'module_name' parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject a path to an arbitrary file on the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary files located on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This can result in complete compromise of the affected system.",
    "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the 'module_name' parameter in the 'addressbook.php' script through a crafted GET request.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
  },
  "exploit_details": {
    "exploit_code": "The provided exploit code is a Perl script that automates the exploitation process. It injects PHP code into the server's log files via a crafted GET request, then triggers the LFI vulnerability using a crafted request that includes a path to the log file containing the injected code.",
    "steps": [
       "The attacker injects PHP code into log files by sending a crafted HTTP request.",
      "The attacker triggers the LFI vulnerability by manipulating the 'module_name' parameter to point to a log file.",
      "The injected code is executed, allowing arbitrary command execution via the cmd parameter within the crafted GET request."
     ]
  },
   "additional_notes": "The exploit code provides a list of common Apache log file paths. The vulnerability can be exploited to gain remote code execution."
