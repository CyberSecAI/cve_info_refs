Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2007-1003 from the provided documents:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   Integer overflow when parsing data in the XC-MISC extension in the X server. Specifically, the `ALLOCATE_LOCAL` parameter in `ProcXCMiscGetXIDList()` is calculated using a client-supplied value, which if large enough, leads to an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Integer overflow**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking on client-provided input that could result in an integer overflow during memory allocation calculations, leading to memory corruption. This could occur both in the evaluation of the expression and during memory allocation.
*   **Lack of input sanitization:** Insufficient validation of input data received from a client.
*   **Memory corruption**: The overflow during allocation calculation can lead to memory corruption or a crash of the X server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Local privilege escalation**: A local attacker (authenticated client) could exploit this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The integer overflow may also result in a denial of service by causing a crash or other unstable behavior of the X server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   A local attacker that has already authenticated with the X server.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted request to the X server using the XC-MISC extension.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Local user access:** The attacker must be a local user on the system, and authorized to connect to the X server.
*   **Authenticated X client**: Requires a client authenticated with the X server.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
*   Several sources (Red Hat, OpenBSD, Gentoo, Debian, Ubuntu, and freedesktop.org) confirm the vulnerability in X.org and its derivatives, particularly in the XC-MISC extension.
*   The vulnerability affects various systems including, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3, OpenBSD 3.9 and 4.0, Gentoo, Debian, and Ubuntu Linux.
*   Patches are provided by the various vendors to remediate the vulnerability.
*   Some descriptions mention the usage of `alloca()` in `ALLOCATE_LOCAL()` as a potential cause of stack corruption when the allocated memory is large.
*   The vulnerability may not be exploitable remotely and is mainly a local privilege escalation issue.
