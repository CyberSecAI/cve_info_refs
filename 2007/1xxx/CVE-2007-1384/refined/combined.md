How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Ktorrent: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200705-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ktorrent allowing for the
remote execution of arbitrary code and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-p2p/ktorrent** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.1.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.1.3** |

### Background

Ktorrent is a Bittorrent client for KDE.

### Description

Bryan Burns of Juniper Networks discovered a vulnerability in
chunkcounter.cpp when processing large or negative idx values, and a
directory traversal vulnerability in torrent.cpp.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to download a specially crafted
torrent file, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running Ktorrent.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ktorrent users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-p2p/ktorrent-2.1.3"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

KDE Mailing List Announcement:

  <http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-announce&m=117346514411140&w=2>

KDE SVN Revision Comments

  <http://websvn.kde.org/?view=rev&revision=640661>

This issue affects all releases prior to the latest 2.1.2 release (from Breezy to Feisty).

Issues related to the possibility of a DoS or heap corruption by allowing idx to either be to small (negative) or to large (chunkcounter.cpp). The other issue is allowing .. in the file names (torrent.cpp). If ran with the regular user damage could be caused by overwriting user config files or directories. If ran as root, it could overwrite system files.

(from 91172, now dup'd)

<http://websvn.kde.org/?view=rev&revision=640661>

From a quick review, the changes to "torrent.cpp" are to stop arbitrary path overwrites, and the other changes are to protect against heap corruption. I haven't studied the code paths too much, but it feels like a very dedicated attacker could manage to get arbitrary code execution.

Thanks for getting these put together. I'll test them all including breezy. I adjusted your debdiffs to include the assigned CVEs, and to use the -security pocket.

Hm, looks like the patch "system" in the dapper and edgy packages need manual changes to the debian/rules files. I've adjusted them.

# USN-436-1: KTorrent vulnerabilities

13 March 2007

KTorrent vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Bryan Burns of Juniper Networks discovered that KTorrent did not

correctly validate the destination file paths nor the HAVE statements

sent by torrent peers. A malicious remote peer could send specially

crafted messages to overwrite files or execute arbitrary code with user

privileges.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* ktorrent
  -
  2.0.3+dfsg1-0ubuntu1.1

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* ktorrent
  -
  1.2-0ubuntu5.1

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart KTorrent to effect

the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
