  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the insecure usage of the `$_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT]` variable in the `include.php` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `_SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT]` parameter in the URL, the attacker can specify a remote file to be included.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and be able to host or have access to a file containing malicious code."
