  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the readwbmp function within the GD library's wbmp.c file, specifically when handling Wireless Bitmap (WBMP) image files in PHP.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Buffer Overflow"

          "Processing specially crafted wbmp image files",
        "Remote exploitation via PHP applications processing untrusted wbmp files"

    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted wbmp image file with large width and/or height parameters to trigger the integer overflow, and thus the buffer overflow."
