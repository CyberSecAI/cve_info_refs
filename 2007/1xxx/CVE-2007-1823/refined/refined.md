{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Certain voice mail systems use Calling Number Identification (CNID, Caller ID) for authentication to voice mail accounts. This allows an attacker to gain administrative access by spoofing their Caller ID.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability stems from using Caller ID as a sole authentication method, which can be easily spoofed. This is a case of weak authentication.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain administrative access to a voice mailbox, allowing them to listen to and delete messages, modify the greeting, potentially charge calls to the account, and perform other administrative actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through inbound phone calls to the vulnerable voicemail system. The attacker manipulates their Caller ID to match the number associated with the target voice mailbox.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to spoof Caller ID, which can be done using readily available PBX software and a H.323/VOIP gateway service or possibly other methods. They also need to know the phone number associated with the target voice mailbox."
