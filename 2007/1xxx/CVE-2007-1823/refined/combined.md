## Voice mail systems allow administrative access based on Caller ID

#### Vulnerability Note VU#726548

Original Release Date: 2007-01-30 | Last Revised: 2007-03-30

---

### Overview

Certain voice mail systems trust Calling Number Identification (CNID, Caller ID) to authenticate administrative access to voice mail accounts. Caller ID can be easily spoofed, allowing an attacker to gain control over a vulnerable voice mailbox.

### Description

| Some voice mail systems use Caller ID to authenticate administrative access to individual voice mail accounts. If the Caller ID of an inbound call matches the number assigned to the telephone associated with the voice mailbox, the system assumes that the call is originating from that phone, and the call is routed to the voice mailbox with administrative privileges. The party originating the call can then listen to and delete messages, modify the greeting, and perform other administrative functions. Some systems ring the phone first, others do not.  Caller ID can be readily spoofed using freely available PBX software and a H.323/VOIP gateway service, and possibly via other methods. Caller ID should not be trusted for authentication.Depending on available product features and default configurations, voice mail service providers may or may not have the option to use Caller ID to authenticate administrative access to voice mail accounts. There are two groups represented in the Systems Affected section of this document: voice mail product/system vendors and voice mail service providers. A vendor is noted as "Not Vulnerable" if their products do not allow Caller ID to be used for authentication by default or do not allow it at all. A service provider is noted as "Not Vulnerable" if their voice mail services do not rely on Caller ID for authentication. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can gain administrative access to a voice mailbox. Depending on the system, the attacker could listen to and delete messages, change the greeting message, or make other modifications. By changing the greeting message, an attacker may be able to charge calls to an account with a vulnerable voice mail system:<[http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,58517,00.html](http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0%2C1377%2C58517%2C00.html)>Any system that relies solely on caller ID for authentication may be vulnerable to impersonation or spoofing attacks. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Require password authentication**If possible, configure voice mail systems to require a password/PIN to authenticate access to administrative account functions. A unique default password should be assigned to each voice mail account. |

### [Nortel Networks, Inc.](#AAMN-5N2QFX) Affected

Notified:  May 28, 2003  Updated: July 15, 2003

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Nortel Networks CallPilot and Meridian Mail voicemail systems do not generally authenticate by Caller ID but require a mailbox number + password to authenticate access to the mailbox. For additional security, users are forced to change the default password assigned to a newly created mailbox, the first time they logon. The only exception is where the auto logon feature is specifically configured by the administrator for a mailbox, in which case a user at the given Directory Number can access the corresponding mailbox without entering the mailbox number + password. Nortel Networks voicemail systems do not hard code or default to this behavior.
