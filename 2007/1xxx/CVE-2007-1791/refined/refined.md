```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `wall.php` script in Picture-Engine is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `cat` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the 'cat' parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Disclosure of sensitive data (e.g., admin username and password).
  - Modification of data.
  - Complete compromise of the database and potentially the server.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable `wall.php` script, specifically manipulating the `cat` parameter with malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
