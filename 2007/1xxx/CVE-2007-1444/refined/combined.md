How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: netserver can be locked by /tmp/netperf.debug
Date: Tue, 06 Mar 2007 13:56:40 +0100
```
Package: netperf
Version: 2.4.3-2
Severity: wishlist

Hello,
I've been confronted to this inconvenience,
so I guess it could help others too

On lunch netperf's server creates the file /tmp/netperf.debug
with  user's ownership (default root)

And this can cause trouble if serveral users start netserver
(on different port of course).

Maybe this can be workarounded by adding port number in debug filename

Also when deamon is stopped, the file is still here,
which may lock users uage of netserver

Last Wishes :
* '--version' option on client and server
* csv output  is welcome too

Regards

package netperf
severity 413658 serious
tags 413658 security
retitle 413658 netserver logs to insecure temporary file
thanks

Since /tmp/netperf.debug is opened without the O_EXCL mode, it's
possible to carry out a serious denial-of-service on another user by
creating it as a symbolic link to one of their files before they run
netperf.

It's also given mode 644 which means it can leak information, though
this is unlikely to be sensitive.

Finally, this is a violation of FHS: when netserver is run as a daemon
its log file should be under /var/log.

Ben.

tags 413658 + patch
thanks

Hi,
attached is a patch (untested, please do so), it's not really nice because
of the global variables but it won't work without them
without bigger code changes.
Kind regards
Nico
