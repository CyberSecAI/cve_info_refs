Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from the fact that Firefox, on certain branches, treated "about:" URLs as ChromeProtocol instead of DenyProtocol. This allowed scripts to load "about:" URIs, enabling a form of history sniffing. This was a regression caused by changes made to implement `about:about`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary issue was that scripts were allowed to load "about:" URIs. This allowed web pages to probe which URLs the user has visited in the current browser session.
- **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability was a privacy issue that allowed an attacker to probe the browser's cache to infer user's browsing history.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:** Attackers could determine which URLs the user had visited during their current browser session. This information can be used to profile users based on their browsing habits and potentially expose information about private browsing, such as whether they are logged into a router or other web based private devices.
- **Targeted Attacks:** Attackers could leverage this information to detect if a user has accessed specific administrative interfaces for devices like routers, allowing them to target users who manage such devices via the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** The attack vector is a website that uses JavaScript to attempt to load specific URLs using about: URIs.
- **Remote:** The vulnerability could be exploited remotely, meaning the user only needed to visit a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker only needs to serve a malicious web page and lure users into visiting it.
- **JavaScript Execution:** The attacker needs to use JavaScript code to test the availability of URLs in the browser's cache.
- **No Authentication:** The attack does not require the user to have authenticated or logged in to any system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is described as a "Firefox Cache Hack - Firefox History Hack redux," suggesting it is similar to but distinct from other previously reported browser history vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability was specific to older branches of Firefox (1.8). The main trunk (newer versions) did not have this vulnerability.
- The fix involved changing "about:" URLs back to DenyProtocol to block the vulnerability.
- A patch was created and deployed to fix the vulnerability.
- The severity was considered "minor" however the exploitability was high.
- The issue was resolved in Firefox 1.8.0.12 and 1.8.1.4.
