Root cause of vulnerability: The `download_pdf.php` script uses `readfile($_GET["pdf_file"])` without proper sanitization or validation of the `pdf_file` parameter.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to the lack of input sanitization on the `pdf_file` parameter.
  - Path traversal vulnerability allowing access to files outside the intended directory.

Impact of exploitation:
  - Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive information like `/etc/passwd`.
  - Could potentially lead to further compromise if configuration files or other sensitive data are exposed.

Attack vectors:
  - Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `download_pdf.php` script.
  - The `pdf_file` parameter is manipulated to include path traversal sequences such as `../../`.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
  - No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, it can be exploited remotely.
