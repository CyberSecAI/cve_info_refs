## CVE-2007-1745

*   **Vulnerability:** File descriptor leak
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the CHM (Compiled HTML Help) handler of ClamAV. Specifically, a file descriptor leak can occur during the processing of CHM files.
*   **Affected Component:** CHM handler in ClamAV.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause the ClamAV scanner to leak file descriptors. This can eventually lead to the exhaustion of available file descriptors, preventing ClamAV from processing further files and effectively causing a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted CHM file to the ClamAV scanner.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious CHM file to be scanned by ClamAV.
*   **Affected Versions:** app-antivirus/clamav versions prior to 0.90.2 are affected.
*   **Resolution:** Upgrade to ClamAV version 0.90.2 or later.
*   **Gentoo Specific:** Gentoo provides a resolution via `emerge --sync` and `emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.90.2"`
*   **Debian Specific:**
    *   For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in version 0.84-2.sarge.16.
