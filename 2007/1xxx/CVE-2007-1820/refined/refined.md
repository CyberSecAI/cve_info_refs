{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Certain voice mail systems use Caller ID (CNID) for authentication to provide administrative access to voice mail accounts. Caller ID can be easily spoofed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of Caller ID for authentication is inherently insecure due to its susceptibility to spoofing."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain administrative access to a voice mailbox, allowing them to listen to and delete messages, change the greeting message, or make other modifications. By changing the greeting message, an attacker may be able to charge calls to an account with a vulnerable voice mail system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Spoofing Caller ID via freely available PBX software and a H.323/VOIP gateway service, and possibly other methods."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the capability to spoof caller ID, which can be achieved via readily available tools."
