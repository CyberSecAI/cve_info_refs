{
  "cve": "CVE-2007-1014",
  "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in VicFTPS versions prior to 5.0 when handling the CWD command, leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when handling the argument of the `CWD` command. Sending an overly long argument to `CWD` results in a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is a denial of service (DoS) condition. Overwriting memory, including the EIP, can lead to application crashes.",
    "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted `CWD` command with an overly long argument to the FTP server.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable FTP server and the ability to send FTP commands."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The provided exploit code demonstrates sending a 400-byte string of 'A's after the 'CWD ' command, which is enough to overwrite the EIP register, leading to a crash. The exploit also mentions that the exception handler is overwritten, preventing an error message, which is more detail than the CVE description.",
