{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way GnuPG handles signed messages in streaming mode. It's possible to insert additional text before or after a signed (or signed and encrypted) OpenPGP message, potentially deceiving the user into believing that this extra text is also covered by the signature.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of concatenated messages when verifying signatures.",
      "Lack of proper identification of which parts of a message are actually signed when using gpg without correctly using the status interface."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can forge a signed message by adding arbitrary material before or after the actual signed content. This could lead users to trust the forged parts of the message, which could have malicious intent or be misleading.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "By manipulating messages using a pipeline or with redirected input and output.",
        "By concatenating plaintext with an existing signed message."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create or manipulate signed messages using GnuPG, and either have the ability to deliver the forged message directly to the victim, or place the message in a location where the victim will read it."
  },
  "affected_components": [
    "GnuPG versions prior to 1.4.7 and 2.0.3",
    "GPGME versions up to and including 1.1.3",
    "Applications using GnuPG without properly using the status interface to verify signed/encrypted messages."
  ],
  "fixed_versions": [
    "GnuPG version 1.4.7 and 2.0.3 and later",
      "GPGME 1.1.4 and later"
  ],
    "additional_notes": "Detached signatures are not affected by this vulnerability. The vulnerability is a variant of a well known problem with the way signed material is presented in a MUA and it is recommended to use detached signatures or PGP/MIME messages over old style clear signed messages"
