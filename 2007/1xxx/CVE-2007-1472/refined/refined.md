Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `$c_basepath` variable in multiple PHP files of Groupit 2.00b5, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local or remote files.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability: The `$c_basepath` variable, which is used in `include` statements, is not properly validated, allowing the injection of malicious URLs or local paths.
- Unsafe handling of global variables: The `groupit.start.inc` file registers global variables from `HTTP_GET_VARS`, `HTTP_POST_VARS`, etc., when `register_globals` is disabled or `magic_quotes_gpc` is enabled. This allows an attacker to overwrite the `$c_basepath` variable by passing it through a GET or POST request.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary PHP code execution: An attacker can include malicious files, leading to arbitrary PHP code execution on the server.
- System access: Successful exploitation can potentially give the attacker full control over the server.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP GET requests: The `$c_basepath` variable can be manipulated via GET parameters in the URL.
- HTTP POST requests: The `$c_basepath` variable can be manipulated via POST parameters.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
