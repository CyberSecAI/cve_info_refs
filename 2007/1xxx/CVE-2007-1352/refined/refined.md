{
  "CVE-2007-1352": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the `FontFileInitTable()` function of the libXfont library when parsing a fonts.dir file due to lack of validation of the declared number of fonts.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Lack of Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the X.org server.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local attack by exploiting a specially crafted fonts.dir file.",
      "Attacker needs to already have access to the system either as an authenticated client of the running X server, or with the ability to (re)start the X server."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access with the ability to use a specially crafted font file, or authenticated client of the X server."
