Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from the FTP server's handling of a long PWD response. Specifically, when the FTP Explorer client receives an excessively long response to the PWD command, it leads to high CPU consumption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Inefficient handling of large input by the client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- 100% CPU consumption on the client machine running FTP Explorer.
- Potentially unresponsive or unusable client.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a crafted, lengthy response to the PWD command to a vulnerable FTP Explorer client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to act as an FTP server, or perform a man-in-the-middle attack on a legitimate FTP server connection.
- Needs to send the crafted response to the PWD command to the target.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code acts as a malicious FTP server that sends a long string as a response to the PWD command.
- The vulnerability is present in FTP Explorer 1.0.1 Build 047.
- The vendor acknowledged the vulnerability and indicated it was addressed in version 1.0.1.52.
