  "CVE-2007-1099": {
    "related_content": "TRUE",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `dbclient` program did not warn loudly enough when a host key mismatch occurred. It prompted to confirm the mismatch but didn't exit, potentially allowing a MITM attack.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient warning for host key mismatch",
        "Lack of strong enforcement of host key validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack could occur if the user blindly confirms the mismatch, potentially allowing an attacker to intercept communications.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "MITM attack where attacker intercepts initial connection and alters the host key"
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack"
      ]
