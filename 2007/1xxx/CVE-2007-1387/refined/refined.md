Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-1387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   It exists in the `DMO_VideoDecoder_Open` function within the `loader/dmo/DMO_VideoDecoder.c` file, which is code shared with MPlayer and also present in xine-lib.
*   The root cause is that the code does not properly check boundaries when reading data into buffers from DMO video files. Specifically, it does not set the `biSize` before using it in a `memcpy`, leading to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** This allows writing past the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable media player (xine-lib or MPlayer).
*   **Denial of service (DoS):** While not explicitly stated in all sources, a crash due to buffer overflow is also a possible impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DMO video file:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious DMO video file.
*   **User interaction:** The user must be enticed into opening/playing the malicious file with a vulnerable player (xine-lib or MPlayer).
*   **Remote exploitation:** The attack is described as remote in some documents, implying the malicious file could be delivered over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a crafted DMO video file:** The attacker needs technical knowledge to create a video file that triggers the overflow.
*   **Ability to deliver the file to the victim:** The attacker needs a way to make the victim open the malicious video file. This could be via email, a malicious website, or other means.
*   **No specific user privileges required:** The attacker does not require prior privileges on the victim's machine.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was present in `xine-lib` versions prior to 1.1.4-r2 and `mplayer` prior to 1.0.20070321
