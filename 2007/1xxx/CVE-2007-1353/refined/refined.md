{
  "CVE-2007-1353": {
    "description": "A flaw in the Bluetooth subsystem that allowed a local user to trigger an information leak.",
    "root_cause": "An uninitialized stack buffer in the Bluetooth setsockopt() function can be leaked via getsockopt() call.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak",
        "Uninitialized Memory"
    ],
    "impact": "Local attackers can use the information leak to read the contents of sensitive kernel memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Local exploitation"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Local user access to the system"
    ],
      "additional_details": "The L2CAP setsockopt code has a small information leak, where 32 bits of kernel stack memory can get leaked. Also the HCI_FILTER case in hci_sock_setsockopt() has a similar issue where data remains uninitialized."
