In analysis of these issues, bugs which rely on an \"untrusted local attacker\" will therefore not be classified as being security-sensitive, since no trust boundary is crossed."

          "comment": "A script which allows unbounded function recursion will eventually cause the interpreter to overflow the process stack and trigger a segmentation fault; this \"feature\" of the PHP interpreter is under the control of the script author so would not be treated as security-sensitive per the introduction.  Since this \"feature\" has been (repeatedly) reported publically as a \"security issue\" in the past, it has been assigned a CVE name by MITRE, [CVE-2006-1549](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-1549).  MOPB-02-2007 and MOPB-03-2007 both concern the handling of (untrusted) input data which contains deeply-nested arrays. MOPB-02-2007 describes how a script processing such input data in a recursive fashion, without concern for recursion bounds, may crash the interpreter, as described in the previous paragraph. MOPB-03-2007 describes how, on automatic deallocation of a deeply-nested-array variable, the PHP interpreter may itself overflow the process stack and crash.  The attack vector here in both cases is the single issue, that PHP allows input arrays of arbitrary nesting; this would be treated as security-sensitive.  The impact of this issue is Low; in both paths the consequence of the bug is to segfault a single Apache httpd child process, which will be immediately replaced."

An input string required to exploit this issue must exceed ~512K in length, so default Apache line length limits will prevent this from being exploited via input data carried in the HTTP request headers or URI.
