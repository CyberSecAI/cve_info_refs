# Security Update Severity Rating System

Attacks that impact customers' systems rarely result from attackers' exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities. Rather, they exploit vulnerabilities for which patches are available but not applied. For this reason, Microsoft recommends that customers make patching a priority. Currently available updates are listed in the [Security Update Guide](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/).

However, not all vulnerabilities are equally severe. To help customers understand the risk associated with each vulnerability we patch, we have published a severity rating system that rates each vulnerability according to the worst theoretical outcome were that vulnerability to be exploited.

| Rating | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | A vulnerability whose exploitation could allow code execution ***without*** user interaction. These scenarios include self-propagating malware (e.g. network worms), or unavoidable common use scenarios where code execution occurs without warnings or prompts. This could mean browsing to a web page or opening email.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Critical updates immediately. |
| Important | A vulnerability whose exploitation could result in compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data, or of the integrity or availability of processing resources. These scenarios include common use scenarios where client is compromised ***with***warnings or prompts regardless of the prompt's provenance, quality, or usability. Sequences of user actions that do not generate prompts or warnings are also covered.  Microsoft recommends that customers apply Important updates at the earliest opportunity. |
| Moderate | Impact of the vulnerability is mitigated to a significant degree by factors such as authentication requirements or applicability only to non-default configurations.  Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update. |
| Low | Impact of the vulnerability is comprehensively mitigated by the characteristics of the affected component. Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems. |

The measure of a vulnerability’s severity is distinct from the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited. To assess that likelihood, the [Microsoft Exploitability Index](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc998259) provides additional information to help customers better prioritize the deployment of Microsoft security updates. This index provides customers with guidance on the likelihood of functioning exploit code being developed for vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft security updates, within the first thirty days of that update's release.

While this severity rating system is intended to provide a broadly objective assessment of each issue, we strongly encourage customers to evaluate their own environments and make decisions about which updates are required to protect their systems.

## Vulnerability Details

#### DNS RPC Management Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1748:

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Domain Name System (DNS) Server Service in all supported server versions of Windows that could allow an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected system.

#### Mitigating Factors for DNS RPC Management Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1478:

The DNS Server Service may not be enabled by default in certain server role configurations. On Domain Controller with DNS Server Functionality, DNS Server, and Microsoft Small Business Server configurations the DNS Server Service is enabled by default.

#### Workarounds for DNS RPC Management Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1748:

Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While the workaround will not correct the underlying vulnerability, it helps block known attack vectors. Specifically, all these workarounds have been tested and shown to block attempts to exploit the vulnerability over RPC traffic as well as port 139 and 445. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.

* **Disable remote management over RPC capability for DNS Servers through the registry key setting.**

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in regedit.exe.
**Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.
1. On the start menu click **'Run'** and then type **'Regedit'** and then press ENTER.
2. Navigate to the following registry location:
âHKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parametersâ.
3. On the **'Edit'** menu select **'New'** and then click **'DWORD Value'.**
4. Where **'New Value #1'** is highlighted type **'RpcProtocol'** for the name of the value and then press ENTER.
5. Double-click on the newly created value and change the value's data to **'4'** (without the quotes).
6. Restart the DNS service for the change to take effect.

* **Managed Deployment Script**

  The following sample registry script can be used to enable this registry setting:

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters]
  "RpcProtocol"=dword:00000004

  The above registry script can be saved to a file with a .REG file extension and can be deployed silently as part of an automated deployment script using regedit.exe using the /s command line switch.

  The DNS service needs to be restarted for this change to take effect.

  For help using regedit.exe to deploy registry scripts please refer to [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article Q82821](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/q82821): Registration Info Editor (REGEDIT) Command-Line Switches.

  **How to undo workaround:** To undo the workaround perform the following steps:

  1. On the start menu click **'Run'** and then type **'Regedit'** and then press ENTER.
  2. Navigate to the following registry location:
     âHKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parametersâ.
  3. Select Registry Key **RpcProtocol**.
  4. Right click on the RpcProtocol Key and select **Delete**.
  5. Restart the DNS service for the change to take effect.

  **RpcProtocol registry key values**

  The value â4â being used above restricts the DNS RPC interface to local procedure calls (LPC) only. This allows for local management only.

  The following values are available for the RpcProtocol registry entry:
* 0x1 - This value corresponds to a setting of DNS\_RPC\_USE\_TCPIP #define DNS\_RPC\_USE\_NAMED\_PIPE0x2
* 0x2 - This value corresponds to a setting of DNS\_RPC\_USE\_NAMED\_PIPE
* 0x4 - This value corresponds to a setting of DNS\_RPC\_USE\_LPC
* **Disable the capacity for remote management over RPC**

  You can re-configure the DNS serverâs management interface to accept only LPC by setting a value in the registry. Other registry values will modify or disable RPC communication differently. For more information on the RpcProtocol registry key please see the following [TechNet article](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/f9b959ae-345e-4639-813d-1c1064d94c90).

  + Setting the value to 4 will mitigate a remote attempt to exploit the vulnerability
  + Setting the value to 0 will disable all DNS RPC functionality and will protect against both local and remote attempts to exploit the vulnerability.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Setting the registry value to 4 will disable remote management and configuration of DNS server functionality using RPC or WMI. DNS management tools, will fail to work remotely. Local management and remote management through terminal services can be still used to manage your DNS Server configuration.

  You will still be able to use the DNS management MMC Snap-in, DNSCMD.exe, and the DNS WMI provider if they are run locally from the server.

  Setting the registry value to 0 will disable all DNS RPC management capability including local administration and configuration.

  DNS Server local administration and configuration may not work if the server being managed has a computer name of 15 characters and is selected by its computer name. To avoid this issue, use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the computer being managed in the DNS administration tools.
* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  Block TCP and UDP port 445 and 139 as well as all unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024.

  The RPC interface of Windows DNS is bound to a port greater than 1024. While the majority of RPC port binding occurs between the 1024 to 5000 range it is possible for the RPC interface to bind to higher unreserved port numbers. Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports that RPC uses, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312). To block all unsolicited RPC requests while preserving DNS management functionality please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 555381](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/555381).

  **Note** An attacker would need to authenticate using a valid username and password to exploit the vulnerability using ports 139 or 445.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Remote management of DNS server functionality using RPC will be disabled. DNS management tools, will fail to work remotely. Local and remote management through terminal services can be still used to manage your DNS Server configuration.

  This includes the DNS management MMC Snap-in, DNSCMD.exe, DNS WMI provider. Additional management and control functionality may be lost for applications or components that use the affected ports.

  Blocking port 445 will prevent computers from connecting to the server through SMB, and prevent servers from accessing shared network folders. Management tools that depend on SMB for connectivity will be unable to connect to the server.
* **Enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **Block TCP and UDP port 445 and 139 as well as affected ports greater than 1024 by using IPsec on the affected systems**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPsec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPsec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

  **Note** An attacker will need to authenticate using a valid username and password to exploit the vulnerability using ports 139 or 445.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Remote management of DNS server functionality using RPC will be disabled. DNS management tools, will fail to work remotely. Local and remote management through terminal services can be still used to manage your DNS Server configuration.

  This includes the DNS management MMC Snap-in, DNSCMD.exe, and the DNS WMI provider. Additional management and control functionality may be lost for applications or components that use affected ports.

  Blocking port 445 will prevent computers connecting to the server through SMB as well as the server will being unable to access folders shared on the network. Management tools that depend on SMB for connectivity will be unable to connect to the server.

#### FAQ for DNS RPC Management Vulnerability - CVE-2077-1748:

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

A stack-based buffer overrun exists in the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Management Interface in the Windows Domain Name System (DNS) Server service.

**What is Remote Procedure Call (RPC)?**

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that a program can use to request a service from a program located on another computer in a network. RPC helps with interoperability because the program using RPC does not have to understand the network protocols that are supporting communication. In RPC, the requesting program is the client and the service-providing program is the server.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

On servers running the DNS Server Service on all supported server versions of Windows, an anonymous attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RPC packet to an affected system. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to run code in the security context of the Domain Name System Server Service, which by default runs as Local SYSTEM.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

DNS Servers, Domain Controllers and Small Business Servers are primarily at risk. These systems could be at more risk if they are placed on untrusted networks where unsolicited PRC management traffic permitted However, firewall best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that RPC validates the length of a message before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

**Notes** When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the frequently asked question, âCan I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine whether this update is required?â in the section, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update, earlier in this bulletin.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

**Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

**Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.

  Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003 R2, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Datacenter Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Enterprise Edition; and Windows Small Business Server 2003 R2:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB935966\Filelist

  Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Small Business Server 2003 with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP2; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP2; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP2; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP2; and Windows Small Business Server 2003 R2 with SP2:

  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP3\KB935966\Filelist

  **Note** This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 935966 security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Software Update Services:**

By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.

For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).

In response to customer feedback, and in order to provide customers with additional time to migrate from Software Update Services (SUS) 1.0, Microsoft has announced an extension to the end of support date to Tuesday, July 10, 2007. Windows Server Update Services, (WSUS), the successor to SUS, supports updating for a broader set of Microsoft products and provides robust management and reporting features. Customers can download WSUS from [Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/updateservices/default.mspx).

**Windows Server Update Services:**

By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

**Systems Management Server:**

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).

**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Windows DNS RPC buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#555920

Original Release Date: 2007-04-13 | Last Revised: 2007-05-08

---

### Overview

The Microsoft DNS service Remote Procedure Call (RPC) implementation contains a stack buffer overflow. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

### Description

| The Microsoft Windows DNS service uses RPC to facilitate remote management. The Microsoft Windows DNS service RPC management interface contains a stack-based buffer overflow. This vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted RPC packet to the RPC management interface. The management interface typically operates on a dynamically-assigned port between 1024/tcp and 5000/tcp.  This vulnerability can also be exploited via the ports used by SMB services (139/tcp, 139/udp, 445/tcp, and 445/udp). However, this attack vector requires valid authentication credentials.More information on this vulnerability, including a list of affected products is available in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-029](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-029.mspx).Exploit code for this vulnerability is publicly available, and it is being actively exploited. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This vulnerability is addressed by the updates included with Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-029](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-029.mspx).Until an update can be applied, the following workarounds may reduce the chances of exploitation. It is important to understand your network's configuration and service requirements before deciding what changes are appropriate. For instance, disabling the RPC interface of the DNS service may prevent administrators from being able to remotely manage a Microsoft Windows DNS server. Consider this when implementing the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Disable the RPC interface used by the Microsoft Windows DNS service**This workaround will configure the DNS management service to to function only via Local Procedure Call (LPC). This prevents exploitation of the vulnerability, however it also disables remote management via RPC, which is used by the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) DNS snap-in.According to Microsoft SecurityBulletin [MS07-029](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-029.mspx), the RPC remote management can be disabled by taking the following steps:   1. On the start menu click '**Run**' and then type '**Regedit**' and then press enter. 2. Navigate to the following registry location: “HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters”. 3. On the '**Edit**' menu select '**New**' and then click '**DWORD Value**'. 4. Where '**New Value #1**' is highlighted type '**RpcProtocol**' for the name of the value and then press enter. 5. Double click on the newly created value and change the value's data to **4**.  Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters]"RpcProtocol"=dword:00000004This will restrict the DNS management interface to Local Procedure Call (LPC) only. Note that the DNS service needs to be restarted for the above changes to take effect. More information on regedit.exe is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article Q82821](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q82821).Additional information regarding how to disable remote administration of the DNS Server service in Windows Server 2003 and in Windows 2000 Server can be found in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article [936263](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936263).**Block or Restrict access to RPC at the network perimeter**This workaround will restrict TCP/IP access to all RPC interfaces, including the vulnerable DNS management RPC interface. This workaround will not prevent exploitation of the vulnerability, but will limit the possible sources of attacks. This workaround will allow remote management using the RPC interface (MMC DNS Snap-in) from selected networks.Access to the RPC Endpoint Mapper service (135/tcp), the ports assigned by the RPC Endpoint Mapper (by default 1024/tcp to 5000/tcp), and SMB services (139/tcp, 139/udp, 445/tcp, and 445/udp) should be blocked at your network perimeter. This will limit your exposure to attacks. Note that blocking RPC and SMB at the network perimeter will still allow attackers within the perimeter of your network to exploit this vulnerability. All unsolicited traffic on the ports listed above should be blocked. |
