```
Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by an infinite loop during the parsing of CRLF sequences when a connection is aborted.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability is present in the handling of carriage return and line feed sequences when a connection is prematurely terminated, leading to an infinite loop.

Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by repeatedly sending incomplete requests and disconnecting, leading to 100% CPU usage on the server. The server will still respond to other requests, but this can lead to a complete denial of service if the number of concurrent connections or file descriptors are exhausted.

Attack vectors: The attack vector is remote, by sending a specially crafted request and aborting the connection.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection with the vulnerable server and send partial requests, which can then be followed by an abrupt disconnection.
