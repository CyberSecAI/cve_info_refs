Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-1224 (though the exploit-db page also mentions CVE-2007-1225)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The NetProxy web filter software improperly handles URLs that omit the "http://" prefix, allowing bypass of access controls and logging mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Web Filter Evasion:** The proxy fails to correctly identify and block URLs that lack the "http://" prefix.
*   **Logging Bypass:** Requests made without the "http://" prefix are not logged, masking malicious or unauthorized access.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The proxy prepends "http://" to URLs in the block list, but does not properly handle URLs without it during request processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Access to Restricted Content:** Users can bypass the web filter and access websites that are supposed to be blocked.
*   **Concealed Activity:** Malicious or unauthorized access can be performed without being logged, hindering auditing and detection.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request.
*   The attacker sends a request to the proxy without the `http://` prefix in the URL, e.g., `GET www.milw0rm.com:80 HTTP/1.0`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the NetProxy server.
*   The attacker must be an internal user or have network access to the proxy server.
*   No specific privileges beyond being able to make network requests are required for exploitation.
