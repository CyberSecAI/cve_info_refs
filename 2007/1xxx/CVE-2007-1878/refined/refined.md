  "CVE-2007-1878": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A critical vulnerability exists in Firefox/Firebug that allows attackers to inject code inside the browser chrome. This can lead to a lot of problems. Theoretically everything is possible, from modifying the user file system to launching processes, installing ROOTKITs.",
    "details": [
      {
        "Root cause": "Cross-zone or Cross-context scripting vulnerability. A script from a web page can be injected inside the browser chrome, or in the zone of the file: protocol. Browser extensions use the chrome: protocol, which is not restricted. If a remote script tricks the browser into executing JavaScript on chrome:, it can take control of the entire chrome and also the underlying operating system.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Cross-context scripting",
          "Lack of security checks for chrome protocol",
          "Unrestricted access through chrome: protocol"
        ],
        "Impact": "Complete control of the system where the vulnerable Firefox/Firebug is installed. This includes:\n\t* Modifying the user file system\n\t* Launching processes\n\t* Installing ROOTKITs\n\t* Reading and writing files",
        "Attack vectors": "A malicious webpage is required to trigger the vulnerability. The user has to visit the malicious page with Firebug enabled.",
        "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious webpage with the specific JavaScript code to exploit the vulnerability."
      }
    ],
     "additional_notes": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered using console.log with a crafted payload.",
         "The vulnerability affects Firebug versions prior to the fix.",
         "Disabling Firebug does not prevent exploitation from local files (file: protocol) - Firebug automatically enables itself even if disabled.",
         "The vulnerability was fixed in Firebug version 1.04, which also added support for disabling file: URLs.",
         "The vulnerability was independently researched by pdp and Thor Larholm.",
        "The original discoverer of the vulnerability is pdp"
