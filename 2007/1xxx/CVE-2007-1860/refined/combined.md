| [Description](#c0)  aeoo    2002-01-15 16:36:34 UTC  ``` My /boot is never mounted, as per default gentoo philosophy.  And when it is  mounted, it's mounted under /mnt/boot.  However, after doing emerge --world update I notice this: -------------------- root@gamma /boot # pwd /boot root@gamma /boot # ls -l total 36 lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            1 Jan 15 14:31 boot -> . -rw-r--r--    1 root     root         7708 Jan 15 16:42 boot-bmp.b -rw-r--r--    1 root     root         7680 Jan 15 16:42 boot-menu.b -rw-r--r--    1 root     root         5920 Jan 15 16:42 boot-text.b lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           11 Jan 15 16:42 boot.b -> boot-menu.b -rw-r--r--    1 root     root          728 Jan 15 16:42 chain.b drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         4096 Jan 15 16:40 grub -rw-r--r--    1 root     root          656 Jan 15 16:42 os2_d.b -------------------- If these files were in fact meant to overwrite anything in my real /mnt/boot  partition, obviously they didn't succeed, and they created a /boot with stuff  in it.  Considering that some people might be using /boot as a mount point and  have boot partition unmounted at most times, that is not good.  The issue is: should boot partition be mounted in /boot prior to emerge  --world update?  If so, can emerge check to make sure it's mounted prior to  executing update?  Or, perhaps, only check it if lilo/grub are being updated?   Or perhaps it should be mounted under /mnt/boot instead?  Should this be  documented on gentoo.org or in emerge --world update's output? ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Nils Ohlmeier    2002-01-15 17:58:04 UTC  ``` This also happened when i did an 'emerge update' on my system. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Daniel Robbins (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-28 12:40:18 UTC  ``` not sure how to solve this one cleanly. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Geert Bevin    2002-01-31 08:48:20 UTC  ``` the to be implemented pkg_prereq() ebuild function could check if /boot is mounted and exit with an error message if it's not ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Geert Bevin    2002-02-04 06:53:42 UTC  ``` fixed in lilo-22.1-r2 and grub-0.90-r5, additional pkg_setup() function provides the required checks and tries to mount /boot automatically ``` |  |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- Acroread wrapper script minor /tmp race
Adobe Acrobat Reader 8.1.2 contained a /tmp race in its "acroread"
wrapper script in the SSL certificate handling. (CVE-2008-0883)
This problem is not triggered by just starting acrobat reader,
but only on certificate handling.
Furthermore Acrobat Reader contained several duplicated copies of
system libraries, which have been removed by this update to make sure
they are up-to-date security wise by using the system provided ones.
Also on x86-64 platforms, the Mozilla embedding detection did not
work and was fixed, so the Splashscreen and Help are again displayed.
Updates have been released on SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10,
SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
Updates for version 7 for Novell Linux Desktop 9 and SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server 9 are still pending.
- Asterisk security issues
A security update was released for the PBX Asterisk, fixing following
security issues:
CVE-2007-6430: Attackers could bypass host based authentication by
using a valid user name.
CVE-2007-6170: Attackers could inject SQL commands under certain
circumstances if 'cdr\_pgsql' was used.
Asterisk was updated on SUSE Linux 10.1 and openSUSE 10.2.
- cacti various vulnerabilities
The following vulnerabilities were fixed in cacti:
- CVE-2008-0783: multiple XSS vulnerabilities
- CVE-2008-0784: path disclosure
- CVE-2008-0785: multiple SQL injections
- CVE-2008-0786: HTTP response splitting on very old PHP instances
Cacti is included in SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3 and
was fixed there.
- compat-openssl097g security fixes
This update of compat-openssl097g fixes a off-by-one buffer overflow
in function SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers(). This vulnerability potentially
allows remote code execution; depending on memory layout of the
process. (CVE-2007-5135)
We released updates for openssl already, but an update for the compat
0.9.7g openssl libraries was missing and is provided with this patch.
Released for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux 10.1 and openSUSE
10.2, 10.3.
- icu regular expression problems
Certain regular expressions could crash the ICU library
(CVE-2007-4770, CVE-2007-4771).
Updated icu packages have been released for all distributions.
- libcdio buffer overflow
A security bug was fixed in libcdio. Long file names in ISO file
systems with Joliet extension could cause a buffer overflow in
libcdio (CVE-2007-6613).
libcdio fixes were released for all SUSE Linux products.
- wireshark/ethereal security problems
The network analyzer wireshark (formerly known as ethereal) was
updated to fix the following security bugs:
- CVE-2008-1070: The SCTP dissector could crash on reception of bad packets
- CVE-2008-1071: The SNMP dissector could crash on reception of bad packets
- CVE-2008-1072: The TFTP dissector could crash Wireshark (maybe
a bug in the Cairo library on specific platforms)
- Jakarta Tomcat security problems
Various security issues in Jakarta Tomcat have been fixed:
- CVE-2006-7196: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
example JSP applications
- CVE-2007-3382: Handling of cookies containing a ' character
- CVE-2007-3385: Handling of \" in cookies
- CVE-2007-5461: tomcat path traversal / information leak
- CVE-2007-1860: directory traversal
- CVE-2008-0128: tomcat https information disclosure
- CVE-2005-2090: tomcat HTTP Request Smuggling
Updates have been released for all distributions.
- perl-Tk GIF security problem
Specially crafted GIF files could crash perl-Tk (CVE-2006-4484).
Fixed packages have been released for all distributions.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Apache mod\_jk: Directory traversal — GLSA **200708-15**

A directory traversal vulnerability has been discovered in Apache mod\_jk.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apache/mod\_jk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.23** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.23** |

### Background

Apache mod\_jk is a connector for the Tomcat web server.

### Description

Apache mod\_jk decodes the URL within Apache before passing them to
Tomcat, which decodes them a second time.

### Impact

A remote attacker could browse a specially crafted URL on an Apache
server running mod\_jk, possibly gaining access to restricted resources.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache mod\_jk users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apache/mod_jk-1.2.23"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions
of Apache Tomcat Jk Connectors. Each vulnerability is given a
[security impact rating](security-impact.html) by the Apache
Tomcat® security team — please note that this rating may vary from
platform to platform. We also list the versions of Apache Tomcat JK
Connectors the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been
verified list the version with a question mark.

This page has been created from a review of the Apache Tomcat archives
and the CVE list. Please send comments or corrections for these
vulnerabilities to the [Tomcat
Security Team](security.html).

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.50

**Moderate: Information disclosure / Denial of service**
[CVE-2024-46544](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-46544)

Incorrect default permissions for the memory mapped file configured by
the `JkShmFile` directive on Unix like systems allows local
users to view and/or modify the contents of the shared memory containing
mod\_jk configuration and status information. This could result in
information disclosure and/or denial of service.

This was fixed with commit
[d55706e9](https://github.com/apache/tomcat-connectors/commit/d55706e92b65018c2e4c7ab14014a996b0174966).

This issue was identified by the Tomcat Security Team on 6 August 2024.
The issue was made public on 23 September 2024.

Affects: JK 1.2.9-1.2.49 (mod\_jk on Unix like platforms only)

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.49

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2023-41081](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-41081)

In some circumstances, such as when a configuration included
`JkOptions +ForwardDirectories` but the configuration did not
provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied requests, mod\_jk would
use an implicit mapping and map the request to the first defined worker.
Such an implicit mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the
status worker and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As
of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all
mappings must now be via explicit configuration. Only mod\_jk is affected
by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.

This was fixed with commit
[0095b6cb](https://github.com/apache/tomcat-connectors/commit/0095b6cb84f41313ee4c0364b49c766168790792).

This issue was reported to the Tomcat Security Team on 7 July 2023. The
issue was made public on 13 September 2023.

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.48 (mod\_jk only)

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.46

*Note: The issue below was fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.45
but the release vote for the 1.2.45 release candidate did not pass.
Therefore, although users must download 1.2.46 to obtain a version that
includes the fix for this issue, version 1.2.45 is not included in the
list of affected versions.*

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2018-11759](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-11759)

The Apache Web Server (httpd) specific code that normalised the requested
path before matching it to the URI-worker map did not handle some edge
cases correctly. If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were
exposed via httpd, then it was possible for a specially constructed
request to expose application functionality through the reverse proxy
that was not intended for clients accessing the application via the
reverse proxy. It was also possible in some configurations for a
specially constructed request to bypass the access controls configured in
httpd. While there is some overlap between this issue and CVE-2018-1323,
they are not identical.

This was fixed in revisions [1838836](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1838836),
[1838857](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1838857),

[1841463](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1841463).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.44

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.43

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2018-1323](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-1323)

The IIS/ISAPI specific code that normalised the requested path before
matching it to the URI-worker map did not handle some edge cases
correctly. If only a sub-set of the URLs supported by Tomcat were exposed
via IIS, then it was possible for a specially constructed request to
expose application functionality through the reverse proxy that was not
intended for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy.

This was fixed in [revision 1825658](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1825658).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.42

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.42

**Moderate: Buffer Overflow**
[CVE-2016-6808](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6808)

The IIS/ISAPI specific code implements special handling when a virtual
host is present. The virtual host name and the URI are concatenated to
create a virtual host mapping rule. The length checks prior to writing
to the target buffer for this rule did not take account of the length of
the virtual host name, creating the potential for a buffer overflow.

It is not known if this overflow is exploitable.

This was fixed in [revision 1762057](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1762057).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.41

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.41

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2014-8111](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8111)

Multiple adjacent slashes in a request URI were not collapsed to a single
slash before comparing the request URI to the configured mount and
unmount patterns. It is therefore possible for an attacker to use a
request URI containing multiple adjacent slashes to bypass the
restrictions of a `JkUnmount` directive. This may expose
application functionality through the reverse proxy that is not intended
for clients accessing the application via the reverse proxy.

As of mod\_jk 1.2.41, slashes are collapsed by default. The behaviour is
now configurable via a new `JkOption` for httpd (values
`CollapseSlashesAll`, `CollapseSlashesNone` or
`CollapseSlashesUnmount`) and via a new property
`collapse_slashes` for IIS (values `all`,
`none`, `unmount`).

This was fixed in [revision 1647017](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1647017).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.40

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.27

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2008-5519](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5519)

Situations where faulty clients set Content-Length without providing
data, or where a user submits repeated requests very quickly, may permit
one user to view the response associated with a different user's request.

This was fixed in [revision 702540](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=702540).

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.26

Source shipped with Tomcat 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.36, 5.0.0-5.0.30,
5.5.0-5.5.27

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.23

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2007-1860](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1860)

The issue is related to
[CVE-2007-0450](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0450), the patch for which was insufficient.

When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and Tomcat)
process a request, the request URL should not get decoded multiple times
in an iterative way by these components. Otherwise it might be possible
to pass access control rules implemented on front of the last component
by applying multiple URL encoding to the request.

mod\_jk before version 1.2.23 by default decoded request URLs inside Apache
httpd and forwarded the encoded URL to Tomcat, which itself did a second
decoding. This made it possible to pass a prefix JkMount for /someapp,
but actually access /otherapp on Tomcat. Starting with version 1.2.23
by default mod\_jk forwards the original unchanged request URL to Tomcat.
You can achieve the same level of security for older versions by setting
the forwarding option "JkOption ForwardURICompatUnparsed".

Please note, that your configuration might contain a different forwarding
JkOption. In this case, please consult the
[forwarding documentation](http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/reference/apache.html#Forwarding) concerning the security implications.
The new default setting is more secure than before, but it breaks
interoperability with mod\_rewrite.

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.22 (httpd mod\_jk module only)

Source shipped with Tomcat 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.36, 5.0.0-5.0.30,
5.5.0-5.5.23

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.21

**Critical: Arbitrary code execution and denial of service**
[CVE-2007-0774](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0774)

An unsafe memory copy in the URI handler for the native JK connector
could result in a stack overflow condition which could be leveraged to
execute arbitrary code or crash the web server.

Affects: JK 1.2.19-1.2.20

Source shipped with: Tomcat 4.1.34, 5.5.20

### Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.16

**Important: Information disclosure**
[CVE-2006-7197](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7197)

The Tomcat AJP connector contained a bug that sometimes set a too long
length for the chunks delivered by send\_body\_chunks AJP messages. Bugs of
this type can cause mod\_jk to read beyond buffer boundaries and thus
reveal sensitive memory information to a client.

Affects: JK 1.2.0-1.2.15

Source shipped with: Tomcat 4.0.0-4.0.6, 4.1.0-4.1.32, 5.0.0-5.0.30,
