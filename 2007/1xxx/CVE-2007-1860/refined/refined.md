{
  "CVE-2007-1860": {
    "Description": "The Apache mod_jk connector, in versions before 1.2.23, decodes URL requests twice, allowing attackers to bypass security restrictions by using multiple URL encodings.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the mod_jk connector decoding URLs within the Apache server before passing them to Tomcat, which then decodes them a second time. This double decoding can be exploited to bypass security rules.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Double URL decoding",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can access restricted resources by crafting specially encoded URLs that bypass access controls.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker sends specially crafted URLs to an Apache server running mod_jk.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior access or knowledge is required, making this a remotely exploitable vulnerability."
