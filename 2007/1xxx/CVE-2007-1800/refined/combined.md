As a result, much emphasis has been placed on the development of various high-level security standards and protocols, but in most cases the simplest attacks, those at the application level, have been neglected.  Nish Bhalla of Security Compass will explore, at a low-level, the vulnerabilities inherent to web services from an attacker's point of view. The talk covers the dependency of web services on xml, the various forms of xml-based attacks, including exploiting parsers and validators, and finally provides recommendations and countermeasures.  This talk is intended for developers and web application architects. It drills down to the details of web services implementation, while maintaining a focus on good versus bad architectural design. | | Nishchal Bhalla, the Founder of Security Compass, is a specialist in product, code, web application, host and network reviews.  Nish has coauthored "Buffer Overflow Attacks: Detect, Exploit & Prevent" and is a contributing author for "Windows XP Professional Security", "HackNotes: Network Security", "Writing Security Tools and Exploits" and "Hacking Exposed: Web Applications, 2nd Edition". Nish has also been involved in the open source projects such as YASSP and OWASP, and is the chair of the Toronto Chapter. He has also written articles for securityfocus and also spoken at web seminars for Global Knowledge and University of Florida.  Nish who is a frequent speaker on emerging security issues has recently been quoted by both CSO magazine as well as Internet news. He has also spoke at many reputed Security Conferences such as at "Reverse Engineering Conference" in Montreal, the "HackInTheBox 2005" in Malaysia and "ISC2's Infosec Conference" in Las Vegas, New York, DC, Toronto. He also has created and taught the Exploiting & Defending Classes for Security Compass. He is also going to be speaking at the upcoming HITB 2006 conference.  Prior to joining Security Compass, Nish was a Principal Consultant at Foundstone, where he performed numerous security reviews (Web Application / Code ) for major software companies, online banking and trading & e-commerce sites. He also helped develop and teach the "Secure Coding" class, the Ultimate Hacking, Ultimate Web Hacking and Ultimate Hacking Expert classes. Prior to working at Foundstone, Nish provided engineering and security consulting services as an independent consultant to a variety of organizations including Sun Microsystems, Lucent Technologies, TD Waterhouse & The Axa Group.  Nish holds his Masters in Parallel Processing from Sheffield University, is a post graduate in Finance from Strathclyde University and a Bachelor in Commerce from Bangalore University.  Sahba Kazerooni is a Security Consultant with a strong background in J2EE software architecture and development, bringing to Security Compass a unique blend of development and security knowledge. Sahba has recently been engaged in Threat Modeling and web application source code review, as well as research on SOA security. He also plays a critical role in the development of curriculum for and delivering of Security Compass training services.  Sahba will be speaking on Web Services security at Security Opus and DallasCon security conferences.  Prior to joining Security Compass, Sahba held the position of Technical Consultant at Workbrain Inc. where he was involved in the end-to-end implementation of a web-based workforce management solution. He has worked and built recommendable relationships with many fortune 500 organizations in various sectors, from retail to airline and transportation. His experience at Workbrain has equipped Sahba with advanced knowledge of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) as well as the intricacies of the JAVA programming language.  Sahba has a BSc in Computer Science with Software Engineering specialization from the University of Western Ontario. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | NIDS: False Positive Reduction Through Anomaly Detection Damiano Bolzoni, PhD student at Twente University Emmanuele Zambon | | --- | | The Achilles' heel of network IDSes lies in the large number of false positives (i.e., false attacks) that occur: practitioners as well as researchers observe that it is common for a NIDS to raise thousands of mostly false alerts per day. False positives are a universal problem as they affect both signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. Finally, attackers can overload IT personnel by forging ad-hoc packets to produce false alerts, thereby lowering the defences of the IT infrastructure.  Our thesis is that one of the main reasons why NIDSs show a high false positive rate is that they do not correlate input with output traffic: by observing the output determined by the alert-raising input traffic, one is capable of reducing the number of false positives in an effective manner. To demonstrate this, we have developed APHRODITE (Architecture for false Positives Reduction): an innovative architecture for reducing the false positive rate of any NIDS (be it signature-based or anomaly-based). APHRODITE consists of an Output Anomaly Detector (OAD) and a correlation engine; in addition, APHRODITE assumes the presence of a NIDS on the input of the system. For the OAD we developed POSEIDON (Payl Over Som for Intrusion DetectiON): a two-tier network intrusion detection architecture.  Benchmarks performed on POSEIDON and APHRODITE with DARPA 1999 dataset and with traffic dumped from a real-world public network show the effectiveness of the two systems. APHRODITE is able to reduce the rate of false alarms from 50% to 100% (improving accuracy) without reducing the NIDS ability to detect attacks (completeness). | | Damiano Bolzoni received a MSc degree from the University of Venice, Italy, in Computer Science with a thesis about anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems. He has been working for a year at the Information Risk Management division in KPMG Italy. He is author of the POSEIDON and APHRODITE papers and gave talks at IWIA workshop, WebbIT and many security conferences in Netherlands. At the moment, he is a PhD student at the University of Twente, The Netherlands. His research topics are IDS and risk management.  Emmanuele Zambon pursued an MSc degree from the University of Venice, Italy, in Computer Science with a thesis about anomaly-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems.Â He has been working for an year at Information Risk Management division in KPMG Italy.Â He is author and researcher of the POSEIDON paper. |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | Software Virtualization Based Rootkits Sun Bing, Research Scientist | | --- | | The most popular virtual execution technologies include pure emulator, API emulator and virtual machine, the typical representations of all these three technologies are Bochs, Wine and VMware respectively. The implementation of virtual machine could be divided into two categories by the virtualization extent employed, those are full virtualization and para-virtualization, the latter has come up and been used in most recent years; the âparaâ means making some assumptions about or doing some modifications on the Target OS. In addition, according to the difference of virtual machine monitor(VMM)âs structure, there are type I and type II VMM, and the type II could be referred to as the hosted VMM as well. As the virtualization technology continues developing and becomes more prevalent, the two biggest processor manufacturers in the world both have developed their new CPU technologies which support virtualization, the Intel VT-x and AMD Pacifica. However, all of the following discussion will still aim at the traditional x86 platform as that is by far the most widely used. The virtualizable processor architecture requires that all the sensitive instructions could be trapped when running with the degraded privilege level. Unfortunately there exists a few non-virtualizable instructions that make x86 a non-strictly virtualizable architecture. In order to achieve the full virtualization of x86, some extremely complicated software techniques should be used to overcome these architectural limitations.  Being an excellent virtual machine software product, VMware has implemented the full virtualization of x86. We take the VMware Workstation version as an example to give a brief introduction about the architecture, basic working principle and some core technologies used of the type II VMM. As a hosted structure, there are two OS contexts, the host and the guest, so VMware must use the total context switch method to ensure necessary execution environment isolation. VMware uses privilege compression and dual execution modes (direct execution and binary translation) to virtualize the instruction execution part of x86 CPU. Direct execution with ring degradation would let a majority of common instructions run natively, and trap most of the sensitive ones at the same time. However, the binary translator would be used to deal with the non-virtualizable instructions. The execution mode selection will be made by the appropriate decision-making module which depends on the CPUâs current mode, privilege level and segment state. It is worthy to point out that binary translation is a very complicated but useful software technique which is also referred to as dynamic recompilation. Besides the fact that the code generation is highly difficult and complex, it will also handle the translation cacheâs synchronization and coherency. However, another technique, used by Plex86, that solves the same problem seems much simpler, which should be a good choice for implementing a light weight VMM. In addition to virtualizing the instruction execution part, VMware also applies some other techniques to virtualize the CPUâs segmentation, paging and interrupt/exception system components, such as deferred shadow segmentation, shadow paging and interrupt/exception forwarding. As to device virtualization, VMware chooses the method of full emulation which provides a complete set of virtual devices that are totally different from the true hardware devices. Since the device emulation depends completely on how each given hardware device works, the implementation method varies.  At present, the virtualization technology has been widely used in many computer related fields, but the research and application of virtualization on the security area is still in an elementary state. Virtualization technology could be applied to developing a non-intrusive debugger, a honey pot that traps malicious programs, and VM Based Rootkits. The Microsoft research team working together with Michigan University has developed a VM Based Rootkit prototype named SubVirt. SubVirt could gain system control after the Target OS was infected and rebooted. SubVirt then made the Target OS run within the context of a VM, while SubVirt itself would run directly on the true hardware. SubVirt could control the behavior of the target system via a VMM and provide some malicious services externally. However some inherent and obvious defects of SubVirt greatly reduced its practicality. Finally, as the most key part of the presentation, we will discuss the complete technical scheme of a novel VM Based Rootkit. The VMBR itself is sort of light weight VMM. After the VMBR is loaded, the VMBR will ensure the target system is still running by placing it into a rootkit created virtual execution environment. It then becomes very difficult for the victim to perceive the rootkitsâ presence or to find any virtualization footprint. Although this novel VMBR is just a proof of concept, it has at least achieved the coexisting transparently and perfectly with the target system.

Although it's true that kernel-mode exploitation often presents some new challenges for exploit developers, it still all boils down to "creative debugging" and knowledge about the target in question.  This talk intends to demystify kernel-mode exploitation by demonstrating the analysis and reliable exploitation of three different kernel vulnerabilities without public exploits. From a defenders point of view this could hopefully serve as an eye-opener, as it demonstrates the ineffectiveness of HIDS, NX, ASLR and other protective measures when the kernel itself is being exploited.  The entire process will be discussed, including how the vulnerabilities were found, how they were analyzed to determine if and how they can be reliably exploited and of course the exploits will be demonstrated in practice.  The vulnerabilities that will be discussed are:   * FreeBSD 802.11 Management Frame Integer Overflow (Patched)   Found and exploited by Karl Janmar.

As this model is dominating in the industry and the community, we show that our novel embedded architecture is more adapted when debuggee systems are hostile and protected at the operating system level.  This alternative modelization is also more performant as the debugger executes from inside the debuggee program and can read the memory of the host process directly. We give detailed information about how to keep memory unintrusiveness using a new technique called allocation proxying.  We reveal how we developed the organization of our multi-architecture framework and its multiple modules so that they allow for graph-based binary code analysis, compositional fingerprinting, program instrumentation, real-time tracing, multithread debugging and general hooking of systems. Finally we reveal the reflective essence of our framework: our analyzers are made aware of their own internal structures using concepts of aspect oriented programming, embedded in a weakly typed language dedicated to reverse engineering. | | The ERESI team is composed of many experienced professional and researchers in computer security and reverse engineering.

But is it? How do you know that the scanner exercised all the vital areas of your application? How accurate and complete are the results? Is relying on HTTP response the best way to find all vulnerabilities in an application? What if there was a way to look at whatâs happening inside the application while these web scanners were hitting the application?  In this talk, weâll explore that âlooking inside the application as the security test runsâ possibilityâthrough byte-code instrumentation. We will see how we can use aspect oriented technologies such as AspectJ to inject security monitors directly inside a pre-compiled Java / .NET web application. We will also go through a proof of concept and demoâturning a typical blackbox test into a âwhiteboxâ test using the techniques discussed in this talk, gaining a more complete picture: gaining coverage insight, finding more vulnerabilities, weeding out false positives reported by the scanners, and gaining root cause source information. | | Toshinari Kureha is the technical lead and principal member of technical staff at Fortify Software.

Due to deregulation and a push toward all-IP architecture, SS7 is opening up, notably with SIGTRAN (SS7 over IP) and NGN (Next Gen Networks) initiatives.  SCTP is the protocol used to carry all telecom signalling information on IP according to the SIGTRAN protocol suite. It's the foundation, as TCP is the foundation for the web and email. SCTP is also used for high-performance clusters, resources pooling and very high-speed file transfer.  When you discover open SCTP ports, you discover a secret door to this walled garden. As a walled garden, the internal security of the SS7 network is not as good as one might expect. SCTPscan is a tool to do exactly just that, and is released as open source.  This presentation will explain how SCTPscan manages to scan without being detected by remote application, how discrepancies between RFC and implementation enable us to scan more efficiently and how we manage to scan without even being detect by systems like SANS - Dshield.org. Here we will have a look at INIT packet construction, stealth scanning and a beginning of SCTP fingerprinting.  Then, we go on to detail upper layer protocols that use SCTP and the potentials of the SIGTRAN protcol suite in term of security. We'll see the M2UA, M3UA, M2PA, IUA which are SIGTRAN-specific protocols, and also the more generic SS7 protocols such as ISUP, BICC, BSSAP, TCAP, SCCP and MTP. | | Philippe Langlois is a founder and Senior Security Consultant for Telecom Security Task Force, a research and consultancy outfit.

What's more popular now are more directed or targeted attacks using a variety of different methods. Since most of these attacks will be a single shot styled attack attackers will often look for anyway to increase the likelihood of success.  This is where data seepage comes in. Unbeknownst to a lot of mobile professional's laptops, pdas, even cell phones can be literally bleeding information about a company's internal network. This can be due to applications like email clients that are set to start up and automatically search for its mail server, windows may be attempting to remap network drives, an application could be checking for updates.  All this information can be used by an attacker to make attacks more accurate with a higher likelihood of success.  Don't laugh and dismiss this as a trivial problem with no impact.

Very little information can be found on the Net and almost every question related to security assessment of these applications keeps being unanswered. Besides, very few public presentations on the subject are available.  At CYBSEC, we had been researching SAP security casually, mostly because we came across some of its components while performing penetration tests in our customers. During that superficial research, we discovered more than 20 vulnerabilities (not all of them has been published yet), some of them highly critical.  Several months ago, we decided to perform a deep research over SAP security. We went really deep, down to SAP 's heart: the SAP RFC (Remote Function Call) Interface.  SAP RFC is the heart of communications between SAP systems, and between SAP and external software. Almost every system that wants to interact with SAP does so using the RFC interface. As stated by SAP: "The RFC library is the most commonly used and installed component of existing SAP software".  Our presentation will describe, after a short description of RFC interface purpose and internals, new vulnerabilities discovered in our research, both in the RFC protocol implementation and in the RFC Library itself.  Beyond new vulnerabilities discovered, our presentation will include description of some new advanced attacks we have developed, abusing default mis-configurations and design vulnerabilities. These are mainly RFC connection hi-jacking and MITM attacks, targeting connections between SAP R/3 and external programs working as RFC servers.  To make knowledge practical and publicly available, we will be presenting and releasing a new open-source tool, which will enable penetration testers and researchers to perform security assessments of SAP systems' RFC interface, allowing them to mine information and exploit the vulnerabilities and attacks described during our presentation.

As the market is still evolving and one framework has been quite successful on the market: "Cisco Network Admission Control". NAC is a pivotal part of Ciscoâs "Self Defending Network" strategy and supported on the complete range of Cisco network- and security-products. From a security point of view âNACâ is a very interesting emerging technology which deservers some scrutiny. We are able to hack the Cisco NAC-solution by exploiting a fundamental design flaw.  Part II: NAC Technology â How it works: The basic idea behind Cisco NAC is quite simple: Before allowing a client admittance to the network the client is tested against a predefined set of âpoliciesâ. These tests are performed by a backend system (a Cisco ACS) which processes .credentials supplied by the client against one or more administrator-defined policies. Based on the result of these tests a client is categorized and a well-defined access-level to the network is granted. While the client is connected to the network it is repeatedly rechecked and the state of the client is reassessed. On a somewhat more technical layer the communication takes place using EAP over UDP with undisclosed Cisco-proprietary EAP messages and the UDP connection itself is secured using SSL. The connection-point to the network (e.g. the switch, wireless AP, Firewall, Router, etc.) acts sort of as a "translating proxy" between the client talking EAPoU and the Cisco Secure ACS server talking RADIUS [Client <-EAPoU-> Switch <-RADIUS-> ACS). Besides this "proxy"-functionality the connection-point also acts as an enforcing element of the security policy. Three somewhat different deployment flavours of Cisco NAC exist but the underlying concept âadmittance-level based on the result of a testâ is always the same.  For every .NAC-enabled application on the client a client-side agent provides so called âcredentialsâ to the ACS server where they are compared against the defined tests to derive a âposture tokenâ per application. From all application posture tokens an overall âsystem posture tokenâ is inferred which determines the access-level granted to the client. The client-side agent of the framework responsible for the communication is the âCisco Trust Agentâ (CTA) which also includes the capability to report a few basic credentials (e.g. OS Version, Hostname, etc) without an additional NAC-enabled application. The CTA contains an API enabling third-party vendors to hook their applications into the NAC framework. Anti-Virus Vendors have been among the first to join the NAC-Alliance formed by Cisco.  Part III: The Problem â NAC is not âsecure by designâ: The Cisco NAC solution contains at least one major design-flaw which enables us to hack (at least) two of the three different variants: The server authenticates itself to the client using a server-certificate and client and server establish a secure tunnel (something like âSSL over UDPâ), but the client does not authenticate itself to the server, so we have a situation in which a component (the client) is authorized without prior authentication. After realizing this fundamental design-error, the idea of a âposture spoofing attackâ was born and research started with evaluating different attack-vectors for their feasibility. In the end we decided to analyse the protocols used within the framework and code our own âNAC-clientâ which provides the ACS with attacker-supplied-credentials in order to get illegitimate access to NAC-secured networks.  Part IV: The Hack â how we did it NAC is a complex system involving different protocols which are used in an odd combination. Especially the usage of SSL over UDP/EAP-FAST over UDP made the usage of SSL-Proxies for man-in-the-middle attacks or clear-text-traffic-analysis with standard methods impossible. So instead of focusing on the network-traffic (which was our first approach â âstare at the packets until you understand themâ), we decided to focus on the client first. Analysing the CTA client in different versions and on different operating systems revealed some of the inner workings of the protocols. Besides âClient analysisâ we built a NAC test-lab and developed a âNAC-test-suiteâ to implement different âadmission-scenariosâ. While running theses tests we hooked into the interesting functions of the client in order to understand the functions used and their (inter)dependencies. As a next step we started coding our own NAC client to get a better insight into the communication process. The first goal was to get a clear text dump of the communication by establishing the secure tunnel. The next goal was to provide our own credentials to the ACS in order to get access to the NAC protected network. We will release our "NAC-Credential-Spoofing"-tool at the conference alongside with our insight into the operating of NAC.  Part V: Our proposed talk We do not wish to simply release a tool; we want the audience to understand how Cisco NAC works, why it is not as secure as Cisco wants us to believe and which mitigations exist, if NAC is implemented (there actually exist mitigations and secure setup-approaches). We will present our approach, disclose technical details yet unpublished and release our tool. As an âadd-onâ-benefit we will explain how to tackle a complex system like NAC when doing security research. | | Dror has enjoyed working with Cisco stuff for more than eight years and is usually busy assessing the security of enterprise networks and data-centers.

The heap protection features in the latest versions of Windows have been effective at stopping the basic exploitation techniques. In most cases bypassing the protection requires a great degree of control over the allocation patterns of the vulnerable application.  This presentation introduces a new technique for precise manipulation of the browser heap layout using specific sequences of JavaScript allocations. This allows an attacker to set up the heap in any desired state and exploit difficult heap corruption vulnerabilities with great reliability and precision.  This talk will begin with an overview of the current state of browser heap exploitation and the unreliability of many heap exploits. It will continue with a discussion of Internet Explorer heap internals and the techniques for JavaScript heap manipulation. I will present a JavaScript heap exploitation library that exposes an abstract heap manipulation API. Its use will be demonstrated by exploit code for two complex heap corruption vulnerabilities.  The talk will focus on Internet Explorer exploitation, but the general technique presented is applicable to other browsers as well. | | Alexander Sotirov has been involved in computer security since 1998, when he started contributing to Phreedom Magazine, a Bulgarian underground technical publication.

The second is a complementary section dealing with ASLR in Windows Vista, its implementation and some surprising results...  Part I Synopsis: GS is a Visual Studio compiler option that was introduced in Visual Studio 2002 to mitigate the local stack variable overflows that resulted in arbitrary code execution. The following paper details the methods Symantec used to assess which binaries within Windows Vista 32bit leveraged GS as a defensive mechanism. This paper presents the results of this analysis, the techniques that have been developed, and supporting material. The results in this paper are from the 32bit RTM release of Microsoft Windows Vista  Part II Synopsis: Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a mitigation technique designed to hinder the ability of an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution when exploiting software vulnerabilities. As the name implies, ASLR involves placing a computer program and its associated memory at random locations, either between reboots or executions, to hinder the attacker's ability to reliably locate either their shell code or other required data. This paper is the result of a brief analysis of the implementation of ASLR within Microsoft Windows Vista 32bit RTM, conducted by Symantec's Advanced Threat Research. | | Ollie Whitehouse has worked in information security both as a consultant and researcher.

It makes the process of finding many common webapp flaws much easier. The user simply navigates the target site while using the WebScarab proxy and ScarabMon constantly updates the user with information on discovered flaws.  ScarabMon is written in Python and all code and modules will be released at the conference.  ScarabMon is also easily extensible, with useful checks often only requiring 5-10 lines of Python code.  I wrote ScarabMon because I couldn't find anything like it.  Historically the standard web proxies have been @Stake's WebProxy (which is totally unavailable anymore as Symantec killed it after the acquisition), SpikeProxy and WebScarab. Those have have recently been joined by two other apps, WebScarab-NG and Pantera.  The latter are not ready for serious usage yet. Pantera development seems to have stalled and WebScarab-NG is missing major features, though it shows the most promise. The latest date on any of the SPIKEProxy files is from 2003.  So basically everyone uses WebScarab for web application pen tests.  WebScarab is obnoxious to program for, as you have to write dozens of lines of Java code (BeanShell) for the simplest tasks. BeanShell is also often unstable.  ScarabMon is currently designed to work with WebScarab, but could be ported to work with any of the above should the need arise. Instead of acting as a proxy, it just monitors the output of the proxy and opportunistically performs tests. Some tests are things people have seen before in other tools (like finding directories that support PUT) and others aren't anything I've seen in any other tool such as finding values that were set as cookies over SSL that later wind up as a query string parameter.  The best thing is that you get all of this for free. You don't have to change \*anything\* about your current testing methodology. You just run ScarabMon in the background and it sees the servers and files you're accessing and generates findings.  Module findings include:   * Insecure Web server SSL configuration* Secure cookie values that later get sent clear or as query string values* Listable webserver directories* Webserver directories that allow upload (via PUT)* Values that cross domain boundaries* Offsite redirects* Values set over SSL that also go cleartext* Fuzzing                 and many more |   [Return to the top of the page](#Top "Return to the top of the page")   | 360Â° Anomaly Based Unsupervised Intrusion Detection Stefano Zanero, Partner and CTO, Secure Network | | --- | | In this talk, after briefly reviewing why we should build a good anomaly-based intrusion detection system, we will briefly present two IDS prototypes developed at the Politecnico di Milano for network and host based intrusion detection through unsupervised algorithms.
