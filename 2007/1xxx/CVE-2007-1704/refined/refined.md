Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1704:

**CVE Description:**  The provided content indicates that CVE-2007-1704 is related to a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Car Manager" component of Joomla! version 1.1 or earlier.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter when handling the `moreinfo` task within the `com_resman` component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Specifically, the `id` parameter, when used in a SQL query is not sanitized properly, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords. In the provided exploit code the attacker attempts to retrieve admin user credentials.
* **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Successfully exploiting the SQL injection could lead to further attacks such as data modification, or full system compromise depending on database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable page (`index.php?option=com_resman&task=moreinfo&id=`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target web server.
* **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** The attacker must know the vulnerable component (Joomla! Car Manager) and the correct request structure.
* **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit script shows the vulnerability can be triggered without prior authentication, meaning the attacker can be anyone with network access to the vulnerable site.

**More Details than CVE description**
The provided exploit script gives a clear illustration of how the vulnerability can be exploited. The script uses a union-based SQL injection to extract usernames and passwords from the `jos_users` table.
