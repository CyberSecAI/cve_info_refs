Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in `phpechocms2`, specifically in how it handles the `_plugin_file` and `root_path` parameters. The `include_once $_plugin_file;` and `require ( $root_path . "lang/" . $language . "/global.php" );` code snippets are vulnerable to remote file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes files based on user-supplied input in the `_plugin_file` parameter in the `core.load_pulgins.php` and `root_path` parameter in the `index.php`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code by referencing external files via URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server and its data, including potentially:
    *   Data theft
    *   Website defacement
    *   Installation of backdoors
    *   Further attacks on other systems on the network

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is performed remotely via HTTP requests.
    *   **Vulnerable URL Examples**:
        *   `www.example.com/[path]/kernel/smarty/internals/core.load_pulgins.php?_plugin_file=[Sh3ll-Script]`
        *   `www.example.com/[path]/index.php?root_path=[Sh3ll-Script]`
*   The attacker injects the URL of a malicious file into the `_plugin_file` or `root_path` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker needs to have a publicly accessible file containing malicious code that can be included.
*   No authentication is required.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided information provides more detail than the standard CVE description, clearly explaining the vulnerable code and how to exploit the vulnerability.
* The issue is rated as high risk with a CVSS base score of 7.5/10.
* The vulnerability has a remote exploit range with low attack complexity and no authentication required.
