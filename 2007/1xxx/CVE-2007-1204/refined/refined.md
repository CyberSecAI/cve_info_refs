{
  "CVE-2007-1204": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the way the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) service handles specially crafted HTTP requests, leading to memory corruption.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory corruption due to improper handling of HTTP requests by the UPnP service.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Local Service account.",
      "Attack vectors": "Attackers on the same subnet as the target computer can send specially crafted HTTP requests directly to the affected UPnP service.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be on the same subnet as the target machine."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The UPnP service improperly validates HTTP requests before passing the data to the allocated buffer.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper validation of HTTP requests, leading to a memory corruption vulnerability.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution as the Local Service account.",
      "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks via specially crafted HTTP requests sent to the UPnP service.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be on the same subnet as the target machine."
