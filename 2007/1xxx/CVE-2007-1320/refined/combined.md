How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1384-1                  security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                               Steve Kemp
October 5th, 2007                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : xen-utils
Vulnerability  : various
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-4993, CVE-2007-1320
Debian Bug     : 444430, 444007

Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor
packages which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-4993

   By use of a specially crafted grub configuration file a domU user
  may be able to execute arbitary code upon the dom0 when pygrub is
  being used.

CVE-2007-1320

   Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the Cirrus VGA extension,
  provided by QEMU, may allow local users to execute arbitrary code
  via "bitblt" heap overflow.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
3.0.3-0-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen-utils package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- imlib2
A security problem was fixed in imlib2 where loading a specific XPM
file could corrupt memory. (CVE-2008-5187)
Affected products: SLED 10 SP2, SLE SDK 10 (updates for other products
were already released)
- valgrind
valgrind reads a file .valgrindrc in the current directory.
Therefore local users could place such a file a world writable
directory such as /tmp and influence other users' valgrind when it's
executed there (CVE-2008-4865).
Affected products: SLES9/SDK (updates for other products were already
released)
- kvm
Rogue VNC clients could make the built in VNC server of kvm run into
an infinite loop (CVE-2008-2382)
An off-by-one bug limited the length of VNC passwords to seven
instead of eight (CVE-2008-5714)
Virtualized guests could potentially execute code on the host by
triggering a buffer overflow in the network emulation code via large
ethernet frames (CVE-2007-5729)
Virtualized guests could potentially execute code on the host by
triggering a heap based buffer overflow in the Cirrus Graphics card
emulation (CVE-2007-1320).
Affected products: openSUSE 11.0, 11.1
- cups
Previous updates for the PNG and HPGL filters were incomplete and
are corrected now (CVE-2008-3641, CVE-2008-5286).
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3, 11.0, SLE10-SP2, SLES9
- lynx
This update of lynx fixes two security bugs:
- untrusted search path allows execution of arbitrary commands via
.mailcap or mime.types file (CVE-2006-7234)
- when advanced mode is enabled and lynx is used as URL handler, remote
attackers can execute arbitrary commands (CVE-2008-4690)
Affected products: NLD 9 SDK, SLE SDK 10 SP2, SLES SDK 9 (updates for
other products were already released)
- xterm
XTerm evaluated various ANSI Escape sequences so that command execution
was possible if an attacker could pipe raw data to an xterm.
(CVE-2008-2383)
(It is usually not recommended to display raw data on an xterm.)
Affected products: openSUSE 10.3-11.0, SLE10-SP2, (SLES9 packages will
be released within this week)

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1284-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Moritz Muehlenhoff
May 1st, 2007                           <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : qemu
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-1320 CVE-2007-1321 CVE-2007-1322 CVE-2007-1323 CVE-2007-1366

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the QEMU processor
emulator, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of
service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2007-1320
    Tavis Ormandy discovered that a memory management routine of the Cirrus
    video driver performs insufficient bounds checking, which might
    allow the execution of arbitrary code through a heap overflow.

CVE-2007-1321
    Tavis Ormandy discovered that the NE2000 network driver and the socket
    code perform insufficient input validation, which might allow the
    execution of arbitrary code through a heap overflow.

CVE-2007-1322
    Tavis Ormandy discovered that the "icebp" instruction can be abused to
    terminate the emulation, resulting in denial of service.

CVE-2007-1323
    Tavis Ormandy discovered that the NE2000 network driver and the socket
    code perform insufficient input validation, which might allow the
    execution of arbitrary code through a heap overflow.

CVE-2007-1366
    Tavis Ormandy discovered that the "aam" instruction can be abused to
    crash qemu through a division by zero, resulting in denial of
    service.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.1+20050407-1sarge1.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 0.8.2-4etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
