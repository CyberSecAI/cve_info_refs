  "cve": "CVE-2007-1909",
  "source": "www.exploit-db.com_fe32ed5e_20250125_062217.html",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `login.php` file of the Battle.net Clan Script 1.5. The script directly uses user-supplied input from the `$_POST['user']` and `$_POST['pass']` variables within a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially gaining access to sensitive data, modifying or deleting data, or taking control of the application's database. In this instance, the provided exploit uses a UNION SELECT to read from the bcs_members table.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the `user` and `pass` parameters in a POST request to `login.php`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send POST requests to the `login.php` file."
  }
