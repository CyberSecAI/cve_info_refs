Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2007-1702:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a remote file inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `mod_flatmenu.php` module of Mambo 4.5.1. The module uses a variable, `$mosConfig_absolute_path`, in a `require_once` statement without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject a URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The core weakness is the ability to include arbitrary remote files. The vulnerable code is:
  ```php
  require_once(
  "$mosConfig_absolute_path/modules/mod_flatmenu.class.php" );
  ```
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `$mosConfig_absolute_path` variable is used directly within the `require_once` statement without proper validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the variable's value.
- **Dependence on `register_globals`:** The vulnerability is contingent on the PHP `register_globals` setting being enabled, which is a PHP feature that is often discouraged due to security risks. When enabled, external parameters are directly introduced into PHP scripts as variables.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file (e.g., a shell), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the Mambo application.
- **Full System Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary code can lead to a complete compromise of the server.
- **Data Theft:** An attacker could also potentially use the access to steal sensitive information stored within the compromised system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The primary attack vector is through manipulating the `$mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter within an HTTP request to the vulnerable `mod_flatmenu.php` script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Mambo application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerability exists in `mod_flatmenu.php` and the method to exploit the RFI flaw through the `$mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.
- **Ability to Host Malicious File:** The attacker must have access to a web server capable of hosting the malicious remote file that will be included.
- **Target Environment Configuration:** The attacker relies on the target server having the `register_globals` PHP setting enabled.
