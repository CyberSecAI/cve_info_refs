{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The SonicBB scripts `search.php`, `viewforum.php`, and `members.php` have flaws that lead to warnings or fatal errors when specific crafted requests are sent, resulting in the disclosure of the full server-side script path.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path disclosure due to insufficient error handling and lack of input validation in PHP scripts.",
      "The vulnerability is only exploitable when PHP `magic_quotes_gpc` is set to `Off`."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's internal file system structure, which could potentially aid in further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via HTTP requests to vulnerable PHP scripts (`search.php`, `viewforum.php`, `members.php`)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable scripts. No authentication is required."
  },
  "affected_systems": [
    "SonicBB version 1.0"
  ],
  "remediation": "The recommended workaround is to disable PHP error messages by setting `display_errors = Off` in the `php.ini` configuration file or via `.htaccess` for Apache servers."
