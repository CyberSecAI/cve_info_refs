### Web Wiz Forums 8.05 (MySQL version) SQL Injection

There is a vulnerability in MySQL version of Web Wiz Forums, free ASP bulletin board system software, enabling SQL injection. The vulnerability is in the code used to filter string parameters prior to including them in the SQL queries:

'Format SQL Query funtion
Private Function formatSQLInput(ByVal strInputEntry)
'Remove malisous charcters from sql
strInputEntry = Replace(strInputEntry, "\'", "&#092;'", 1, -1, 1)
strInputEntry = Replace(strInputEntry, """", "", 1, -1, 1)
strInputEntry = Replace(strInputEntry, "'", "''", 1, -1, 1)
strInputEntry = Replace(strInputEntry, "[", "&#091;", 1, -1, 1)
strInputEntry = Replace(strInputEntry, "]", "&#093;", 1, -1, 1)
strInputEntry = Replace(strInputEntry, "<", "&lt;", 1, -1, 1)
strInputEntry = Replace(strInputEntry, ">", "&gt;", 1, -1, 1)
'Return
formatSQLInput = strInputEntry
End Function

Assume the user enters a string containing the following sequence of characters: \"' (a backslash, followed by a double quote followed by a single quote). The first line inside the function above would do nothing, the second line would remove the double quote, and after the third line the sequence would look like \'' (a backslash followed by two single quotes). In MySQL the first two characters would be interpreted as an escaped single quote and the third character would terminate the quotes thus allowing injection of arbitrary SQL code placed after it.

Only the MySQL version of the Web Wiz Forums is vulnerable to this as SQL Server and MS Access don't use backslash as an escape character.

Below I include a small exploit that demonstrates this vulnerability.

Mar 19th 2007: Vulnerability discovered
Mar 20th 2007: Vendor contacted
Mar 20th 2007: Vendor responded
Mar 20th 2007: Vendor released fixed version (8.05a)

<form method="post" action="http://localhost/forum/pop\_up\_member\_search.asp?">

It seems vendor did well once. Fast contact and fast patch -even patch was simply to make-. Good job.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
