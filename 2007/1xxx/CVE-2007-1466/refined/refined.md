It details multiple vulnerabilities in libwpd, including heap overflows and an integer overflow. The vulnerabilities can be triggered by processing a specially crafted WordPerfect file. Exploitation could lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution with the user's privileges. The attack vector is remote, meaning a user could be enticed into opening a malicious file. The advisory recommends upgrading to libwpd version 0.8.9 or later to resolve the issue. This document provides more specific information than the official CVE description." ,
