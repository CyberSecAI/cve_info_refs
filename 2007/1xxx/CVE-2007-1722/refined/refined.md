Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `DownloadCertificateExt()` function of the SignKorea SKCommAX ActiveX control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `DownloadCertificateExt()` function does not properly validate the `pszUserID` argument, allowing for a buffer overflow when a long string is provided as input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain remote user privileges on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a specially crafted HTML file.
- **ActiveX Control:** The vulnerability resides within the SKCommAX ActiveX control, making web browsers a primary attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious HTML file that leverages the vulnerable `DownloadCertificateExt()` function by providing an oversized `pszUserID` parameter. The user needs to open this HTML file.
- The attacker does not need to be on the local network, as the exploit can be delivered remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected versions are SKCommAX ActiveX Control Module 7,2,0,2 and SKCommAX ActiveX Control Module(3280) 6,6,0,1.
- The vulnerability is considered "High critical" and was patched by the vendor within 6 days of notification to KISA (Korea Information Security Agency).
- The advisory was publicly disclosed on March 26, 2007.
