  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insecure inclusion of external files in multiple PHP scripts.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in `lms-1.5.3` (old version)",
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in `lms-1.8.9` (latest version), affecting `welcome.php` and `userpanel.php`."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to execution of malicious code on the server.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By manipulating the `_LIB_DIR` parameter in `welcome.php`.",
       "By manipulating the `CONFIG[directories][userpanel_dir]` parameter in `userpanel.php`."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and have a remote file server hosting malicious code."
