Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `contact_business.php` and `contact_person.php` files of phpContact. These files use an include statement with a variable `$include_path` that can be controlled via URL parameters. Specifically, this allows an attacker to inject a path to a malicious file, leading to Remote File Inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include arbitrary remote files using the `$include_path` variable in the `include()` function. This is due to lack of sanitization of the `$include_path` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `$include_path` parameter before using it in the `include` statement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include a malicious file (e.g., a PHP shell) from a remote server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- **Compromise of the Application:** Successful exploitation leads to the complete compromise of the web application.
- **Data Theft and Manipulation:** Attackers can steal sensitive data and perform other malicious activities on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to `contact_business.php` and `contact_person.php`, appending the `include_path` parameter with a URL to the attacker's malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Files:** The attacker must know the vulnerable files and the parameter used to inject the malicious path.
- **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker must host a malicious file (e.g., a PHP shell) on a server accessible to the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippets are:
```php
// In contact_business.php and contact_person.php
include("include/include_preferences.inc.php");
include($include_path . "include_session.inc.php");
include($include_path . "include_mysql_connect.inc.php");

// In include_preferences.inc.php
$include_path = "include/";
```
The vulnerability occurs because the `$include_path` is set to a default value, but the `contact_business.php` and `contact_person.php` files directly use this variable in a way that can be controlled via the URL parameter `include_path`. The provided exploit example shows that this variable can be used to include a remote file named `shell.txt` with the following exploit:
```
http://victim/path/contact_business.php?include_path=shell.txt?
http://victim/path/contact_person.php?include_path=shell.txt?
```

This confirms the remote file inclusion vulnerability.
