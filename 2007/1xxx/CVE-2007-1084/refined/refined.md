Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2007-1084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue is that Firefox allows users to bookmark `javascript:` and `data:` URLs. When these bookmarks are invoked, the embedded JavaScript code executes within the context of the currently viewed page. This bypasses same-origin policy restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By bookmarking a malicious `javascript:` or `data:` URL, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code on any web page the user visits after clicking the bookmark.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The browser does not properly validate or sanitize the content of `javascript:` and `data:` URLs when they are bookmarked.
*   **Lack of User Awareness:** Users may unknowingly bookmark malicious URLs, especially when tricked into doing so through social engineering tactics.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could steal session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts (e.g., Gmail as mentioned in the bug report).
*   **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts could be used to extract sensitive data from the victim's browsing session.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious websites or display fake login forms within a legitimate page context.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although within the browser context, the attacker can execute arbitrary javascript, potentially modifying the page content or redirecting the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Social Engineering:** Tricking users into visiting a page containing a crafted `javascript:` or `data:` URL, which then gets inadvertently bookmarked by the user (e.g., using CTRL+D).
*   **Malicious Links/Pages:** An attacker could embed a malicious javascript: or data: link on a web page, or convince the user to bookmark a page which in turn will execute the payload.
*   **Drag and Drop:** Users might drag such links to the bookmarks toolbar or other bookmark locations, which would also create the exploit vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to either:
    *   Persuade the user to visit a malicious link that executes and evaluates a `javascript:` or `data:` URL and then bookmarks the resulting page.
    *   Convince the user to drag and drop a crafted link to their bookmarks toolbar.
*   The attacker can be an external or an internal user.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report mentions that other browsers, like MSIE7, handle bookmarking these URLs differently, by bookmarking the last seen "physical" page, which mitigates the issue.
*   The bug report also mentions the need to address similar vulnerabilities in other Mozilla-based applications like Camino and SeaMonkey.
*  There is a discussion about the UI and how to prevent this sort of attack, including disabling bookmarking of such links altogether or creating a warning/confirmation dialog.
* The severity was rated as S3 (Normal) and not as a high severity bug, because the attack requires user interaction.
* The bug report contains several discussions about how to fix this issue and it seems that the fix was not trivial to implement.
