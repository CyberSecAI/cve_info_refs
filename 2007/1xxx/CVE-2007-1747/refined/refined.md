      {
        "Source": "docs.microsoft.com_21fc49f3_20250125_201337.html",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "Microsoft Office does not perform sufficient data validation when parsing Office drawing objects, leading to memory corruption.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Office handles a specially crafted drawing object. When Office parses a malformed drawing object, it may corrupt memory.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system, potentially gaining complete control of the affected system.",
        "Attack vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Office file to the user, either as an e-mail attachment or by hosting the file on a malicious website. The user must open the file for the exploit to be successful.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Office file containing a malformed drawing object and convince the user to open it. In a web-based attack, the attacker needs a website to host the malicious file and persuade users to visit the site."

        "Root cause of vulnerability": "Microsoft Office fails to properly handle malformed drawing objects embedded within Office documents.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of malformed drawing objects can lead to memory corruption.",
         "Impact of exploitation":"A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Office application. If the user is logged in with administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of a vulnerable system.",
        "Attack vectors": "By convincing a user to open a specially crafted Office document.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious Office document and convince a user to open it."
