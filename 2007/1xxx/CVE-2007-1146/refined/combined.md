# [VIM] Verified: arabhost function.php RFI

BUGTRAQ:20070222 Hasadya Raed
<http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/460933/100/0/threaded>

Since the script download at
<http://delmaa.com/upfile/users/arabHost.zip>
is currently 404. I'll refer to the Google Code cache of
arabHost/function.php:

<http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&q=show:y_09L32ZX4g:c-H4PKvziZc:C>
SW92BIlIMw&sa=N&ct=rd&cs_p=[http://delmaa.com/upfile/users/arabHost.zip&](http://delmaa.com/upfile/users/arabHost.zip%26)
cs_f=arabHost/function.php

Code (lines 1-4):
> <?php
>
> include("includes/protaction.php");
> include("$adminfloder/config.php");

And the package contains no "includes/protaction.php" file (and
the ReadMe.html is in Arabic), so this issue does appear valid.

Sorry jericho, no disputes this time.
