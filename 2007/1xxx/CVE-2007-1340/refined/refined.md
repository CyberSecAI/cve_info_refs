- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `eintrag.php` script in News-Letterman 1.1 includes a file specified by the `sqllog` parameter without proper sanitization, leading to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The vulnerable code is `include ($sqllog);`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**: The application includes an external file specified by a user-controlled parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Arbitrary code execution**: By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **HTTP GET request**: The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `eintrag.php` script, including the URL of the malicious file in the `sqllog` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    - The attacker needs access to a web server where the malicious file is hosted.
