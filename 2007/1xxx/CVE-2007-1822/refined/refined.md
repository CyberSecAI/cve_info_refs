{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Certain voice mail systems use Caller ID (CNID) for authentication of administrative access to voice mail accounts. Caller ID can be easily spoofed.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Reliance on Caller ID for authentication",
    "Lack of password/PIN authentication for administrative functions"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain administrative access to a voice mailbox, listen to and delete messages, change the greeting message, and potentially charge calls to the victim's account.",
  "Attack vectors": "Spoofing Caller ID using freely available PBX software, H.323/VOIP gateway services, or possibly other methods.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to spoof Caller ID; knowledge of the target's phone number."
