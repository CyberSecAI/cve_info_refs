      "exploit_source": "www.exploit-db.com_031c16b1_20250124_203638.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `includes/base.php` file of Activist Mobilization Platform (AMP) version 3.2. The `$base_path` parameter in the `require_once()` function is not properly sanitized, allowing for the inclusion of arbitrary local or remote files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
        "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
       "impact": "Arbitrary PHP code execution leading to potential system access.",
      "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can manipulate the `base_path` parameter in the `includes/base.php` file by providing a URL to a malicious PHP script, which will then be included and executed on the server.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and supply a crafted `base_path` parameter. No prior authentication is required."
