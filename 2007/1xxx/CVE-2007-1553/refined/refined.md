ருக்கு Root cause: The Guestbara 1.2 application allows remote attackers to change the administrator login and password.

Weaknesses: Lack of proper input validation and authentication mechanisms.

Impact: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel and compromise the entire guestbook application.

Attack vector: By submitting a crafted POST request to the 'admin/configuration.php' script with the 'action=saveconfig&zapis=ok' parameters.

Required capabilities: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable 'configuration.php' script. No authentication is required prior to the attack.
