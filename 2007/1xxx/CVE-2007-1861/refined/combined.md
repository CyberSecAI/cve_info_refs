How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)

## Details

The compat\_sys\_mount function allowed local users to cause a denial of

service when mounting a smbfs filesystem in compatibility mode.

([CVE-2006-7203](/security/CVE-2006-7203))

The Omnikey CardMan 4040 driver (cm4040\_cs) did not limit the size of

buffers passed to read() and write(). A local attacker could exploit

this to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. ([CVE-2007-0005](/security/CVE-2007-0005))

Due to a variable handling flaw in the ipv6\_getsockopt\_sticky()

function a local attacker could exploit the getsockopt() calls to

read arbitrary kernel memory. This could disclose sensitive data.

([CVE-2007-1000](/security/CVE-2007-1000))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that Bluetooth setsockopt calls could leak

kernel memory contents via an uninitialized stack buffer. A local

attacker could exploit this flaw to view sensitive kernel information.

([CVE-2007-1353](/security/CVE-2007-1353))

A flaw was discovered in the handling of netlink messages. Local

attackers could cause infinite recursion leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2007-1861](/security/CVE-2007-1861))

A flaw was discovered in the IPv6 stack's handling of type 0 route

headers. By sending a specially crafted IPv6 packet, a remote attacker

could cause a denial of service between two IPv6 hosts. ([CVE-2007-2242](/security/CVE-2007-2242))

The random number generator was hashing a subset of the available

entropy, leading to slightly less random numbers. Additionally, systems

without an entropy source would be seeded with the same inputs at boot

time, leading to a repeatable series of random numbers. ([CVE-2007-2453](/security/CVE-2007-2453))

A flaw was discovered in the PPP over Ethernet implementation. Local

attackers could manipulate ioctls and cause kernel memory consumption

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2525](/security/CVE-2007-2525))

An integer underflow was discovered in the cpuset filesystem. If mounted,

local attackers could obtain kernel memory using large file offsets

while reading the tasks file. This could disclose sensitive data.

([CVE-2007-2875](/security/CVE-2007-2875))

Vilmos Nebehaj discovered that the SCTP netfilter code did not correctly

validate certain states. A remote attacker could send a specially

crafted packet causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2876](/security/CVE-2007-2876))

Luca Tettamanti discovered a flaw in the VFAT compat ioctls on 64-bit

systems. A local attacker could corrupt a kernel\_dirent struct and

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2878](/security/CVE-2007-2878))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* linux-image-2.6.17-12-mckinley
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-powerpc64-smp
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-hppa32
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-hppa64
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-sparc64-smp
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-generic
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-powerpc-smp
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-386
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-server-bigiron
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-itanium
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-powerpc
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-sparc64
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-server
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the Ubuntu 6.10 kernel updates

have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you

use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to

get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually

uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (linux-386, linux-powerpc,

linux-amd64-generic, etc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2007-1496

    Michal Miroslaw reported a DoS vulnerability (crash) in netfilter.
    A remote attacker can cause a NULL pointer dereference in the
    nfnetlink_log function.

CVE-2007-1497

    Patrick McHardy reported an vulnerability in netfilter that may
    allow attackers to bypass certain firewall rules. The nfctinfo
    value of reassembled IPv6 packet fragments were incorrectly initalized
    to 0 which allowed these packets to become tracked as ESTABLISHED.

CVE-2007-1861

    Jaco Kroon reported a bug in which NETLINK_FIB_LOOKUP packages were
    incorrectly routed back to the kernel resulting in an infinite
    recursion condition. Local users can exploit this behavior
    to cause a DoS (crash).

This problem has been fixed in the stable distribution in version
2.6.18.dfsg.1-12etch2.

The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                 Debian 4.0 (etch)
     fai-kernels                 1.17+etch2
     user-mode-linux             2.6.18-1um-2etch2
     kernel-patch-openvz         028.18.1etch1

We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

A flaw was discovered in dvb ULE decapsulation. A remote attacker could

send a specially crafted message and cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2006-4623](/security/CVE-2006-4623))

The compat\_sys\_mount function allowed local users to cause a denial of

service when mounting a smbfs filesystem in compatibility mode.

([CVE-2006-7203](/security/CVE-2006-7203))

The Omnikey CardMan 4040 driver (cm4040\_cs) did not limit the size of

buffers passed to read() and write(). A local attacker could exploit

this to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. ([CVE-2007-0005](/security/CVE-2007-0005))

Due to an variable handling flaw in the ipv6\_getsockopt\_sticky()

function a local attacker could exploit the getsockopt() calls to read

arbitrary kernel memory. This could disclose sensitive data.

([CVE-2007-1000](/security/CVE-2007-1000))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that Bluetooth setsockopt calls could

leak kernel memory contents via an uninitialized stack buffer. A local

attacker could exploit this flaw to view sensitive kernel information.

([CVE-2007-1353](/security/CVE-2007-1353))

A flaw was discovered in the handling of netlink messages. Local

attackers could cause infinite recursion leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2007-1861](/security/CVE-2007-1861))

The random number generator was hashing a subset of the available entropy,

leading to slightly less random numbers. Additionally, systems without

an entropy source would be seeded with the same inputs at boot time,

leading to a repeatable series of random numbers. ([CVE-2007-2453](/security/CVE-2007-2453))

A flaw was discovered in the PPP over Ethernet implementation. Local

attackers could manipulate ioctls and cause kernel memory consumption

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2525](/security/CVE-2007-2525))

An integer underflow was discovered in the cpuset filesystem. If mounted,

local attackers could obtain kernel memory using large file offsets

while reading the tasks file. This could disclose sensitive data.

([CVE-2007-2875](/security/CVE-2007-2875))

Vilmos Nebehaj discovered that the SCTP netfilter code did not correctly

validate certain states. A remote attacker could send a specially

crafted packet causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2876](/security/CVE-2007-2876))

Luca Tettamanti discovered a flaw in the VFAT compat ioctls on 64-bit

systems. A local attacker could corrupt a kernel\_dirent struct and

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2878](/security/CVE-2007-2878))

A flaw was discovered in the cluster manager. A remote attacker could

connect to the DLM port and block further DLM operations.

([CVE-2007-3380](/security/CVE-2007-3380))

A flaw was discovered in the usblcd driver. A local attacker could

cause large amounts of kernel memory consumption, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2007-3513](/security/CVE-2007-3513))
