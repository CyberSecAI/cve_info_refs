{
  "CVE-2007-1859": {
    "Description": "XScreenSaver incorrectly handles the results of the getpwuid() function in drivers/lock.c when using directory servers during a network outage.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way xscreensaver parses a call to getpwuid(getuid()). The getpwuid call can return NULL in certain instances, specifically when using remote directory services like NIS or LDAP during a network outage. The code does not properly handle the NULL return, resulting in a flawed authentication process.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of NULL return values from getpwuid().",
      "Inadequate validation of authentication responses when network connectivity is disrupted.",
       "Authentication bypass vulnerability."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can bypass the screen lock by interrupting network connectivity. This results in unauthorized access to the user's session without the need for a valid password.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local user can trigger the vulnerability.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to interrupt network connectivity to the system. This is typically achieved by disconnecting the network cable or disabling the network adapter."
