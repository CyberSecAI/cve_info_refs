- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in how the DivX Web Player ActiveX control (npdivx32.dll) handles the `Resize` method. When excessively large arguments are passed to the `Resize` method, it leads to an access violation due to an attempt to write to an invalid memory location.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation when processing the arguments passed to the `Resize` method. This allows an attacker to specify overly large values that result in memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the application to crash.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves embedding a malicious HTML page that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control. Specifically, a VBScript is used to instantiate the control, and invoke the `Resize` method with large integer values.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage or inject code into a webpage that a victim will visit using a vulnerable version of the DivX web player.
