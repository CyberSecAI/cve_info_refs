{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'op' parameter before including it in a file path, leading to a Local File Inclusion vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files from the server, potentially leading to information disclosure, code execution, or other unauthorized actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `op` parameter in the URL to include a file path to a local file, such as an apache log file, using directory traversal sequences like `../`.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication is required."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "exploit_code": "The provided exploit code is a Perl script that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability. It injects code into the server logs, and then includes these logs using the LFI vulnerability and the 'op' parameter.",
      "exploit_steps": [
        "Inject code into server logs by sending a request with a specific User-Agent that contains the code.",
        "Send a second HTTP request that include the log file with the injected code using the vulnerable 'op' parameter."
