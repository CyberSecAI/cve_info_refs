Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-1459:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insecure `include_once` function in the `mods/content/load.inc.php` file, as well as other files like `config/load.inc.php` and `http/load.inc.php`.
*   The `$moddir` parameter, used in the `include_once` statement, is not properly sanitized before being used in a file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include arbitrary files from external resources. Because of the lack of input sanitization, the `$moddir` parameter can be manipulated to include files from a remote server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary PHP Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote location, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **System Access:** The exploit description indicates that successful exploitation can lead to system access. This would mean the attacker could gain considerable control over the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered via a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script.
*   **Manipulated `moddir` Parameter:** The attacker includes a URL in the `moddir` parameter, pointing to a malicious PHP file hosted on an attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script, such as `mods/content/load.inc.php`, `config/load.inc.php`, or `http/load.inc.php`.
*   **Ability to Host a Malicious File:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious PHP file to be included by the target.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects WebCreator versions up to and including 0.2.6-rc3.
*   The exploit was publicly disclosed on March 13, 2007.
*   The exploit documentation specifies that the vulnerability exists because user-supplied input is not properly validated before being passed to the `include_once()` function.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by sanitizing the `$moddir` variable and disabling `register_globals`.
