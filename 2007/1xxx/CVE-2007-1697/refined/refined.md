    {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files using a variable without proper sanitization, which leads to remote file inclusion. Additionally, the application reads a file specified by a user-controlled variable allowing for file disclosure.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
            "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
            "File Disclosure"
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include remote files, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server. They can also read sensitive files on the server, potentially disclosing configuration or other sensitive information.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "Modifying the `CssFile` parameter in `header.inc.php` to include a remote file.",
            "Modifying the `file` parameter in `download.php` to disclose local files."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or specific network position is required."
