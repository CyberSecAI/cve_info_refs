Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified security issues:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The primary root cause appears to be a combination of factors:

1.  **Session Management:**  The OpenID provider (MyOpenID.com) maintains a session, and a user logged into the provider can be re-authenticated on a relying party website without explicit consent, if "always trust" is selected. This means that if a user has an active session with the OpenID provider and has previously granted persistent access to a relying party, the attacker can re-establish a session without further interaction by the user.
2.  **Lack of Authorization on Cached Tokens:** The OpenID specification or its implementations at the time may not have been robust enough in requiring explicit authorization for cached tokens. This allows an attacker to potentially bypass the user dialog for granting trust to a relying party.
3.  **Crafted Requests:** It's possible to create a specially crafted web page that can automatically log a user onto a website and also add that website to the "always trust" list within the OpenID provider, without requiring explicit user confirmation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unintentional Re-authentication:** If a user is logged into an OpenID provider and has previously logged into a relying party with persistent trust enabled, an attacker can force re-authentication to the relying party without user interaction.
2.  **Bypassing Trust Dialogs:** An attacker can potentially bypass the trust dialog that is supposed to require user confirmation before granting permanent access to a relying party. This can be done with a crafted webpage and a valid session with the OpenID provider.
3.  **Lack of Authorization:** The lack of consistent and strict authorization checking on cached tokens or existing sessions can lead to unauthorized access to relying party sites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to a user's account on a relying party site. This could lead to data breaches, account hijacking, or other forms of unauthorized activity.
2.  **Automatic Addition to "Always Trust":** An attacker could force a user to add a malicious site to their "always trust" list, making them vulnerable to future attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Website:** An attacker could host a malicious web page that exploits these vulnerabilities. When a logged-in user visits this page, the attack can be initiated.
2.  **Phishing:** An attacker could use a phishing attack to trick a user into visiting a malicious page that exploits these vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **User Must Be Logged into OpenID Provider:** The attacker requires the victim to have an active session with the vulnerable OpenID provider.
2.  **Knowledge of OpenID Login URL:** The attacker needs to know the login URL of the relying party site to perform the re-authentication attack.
3.  **Crafting Web Pages:** The attacker needs to be able to create malicious web pages that perform the crafted requests to exploit the trust dialog bypass.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The messages indicate that the initial vulnerability was found on MyOpenID.com, but it was later considered that the problem might be in the OpenID protocol itself.
*   The vulnerability was actively being fixed by MyOpenID at the time of these discussions.
*   The vulnerability was demonstrated to work in at least one browser, and the discoverer believed it could be reproduced in others.
*   The discoverer of the vulnerability (gaz_sec) chose to wait before publicly disclosing the details to allow other OpenID providers a chance to respond.

The information provided in these messages is more detailed than the standard CVE description, giving a good understanding of the nature of the vulnerabilities.
