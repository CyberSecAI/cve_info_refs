Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1130:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** flaw in the `sinagb.php` script of Sinapis 2.2 Gastebuch. Specifically, the script includes a file specified by the `fuss` parameter without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `fuss` parameter is directly used in an `include` statement without validation, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary remote files.
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `include($fuss)` statement is vulnerable to RFI, as an attacker can specify a URL to a malicious file hosted on an external server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to a full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `sinagb.php` script, using the `fuss` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `fuss` parameter is vulnerable to RFI.
- **External Server:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious PHP file to be included.

**Technical Details:**

The relevant code snippet is:

```php
if($fuss == ""){
echo "</body></html>";}
else{
include($fuss);}       <<< rfi coded
```

The exploit example provided is:

```
http://SITE.com/path//sinagb.php?fuss=[SHELL]
```

This demonstrates how an attacker can inject a URL containing malicious PHP code into the `fuss` parameter, leading to remote code execution on the target server.
