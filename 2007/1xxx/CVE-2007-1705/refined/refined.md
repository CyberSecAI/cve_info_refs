Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `catid` parameter of the `default.asp` page within the Active Trade application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input in the `catid` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, and other administrative data. In this specific case, the exploit demonstrates retrieving admin credentials.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By retrieving the administrator username and password, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the administrative interface (`/admin.asp`) of the application.
*   **Full Database Control:** With a successful SQL injection attack, the attacker may potentially achieve complete database control, potentially leading to data modification, deletion or other harmful actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `default.asp` page. The malicious SQL code is included within the `catid` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know or discover the vulnerable parameter name (`catid`) and the format of the URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit examples demonstrate how to retrieve the administrator username and password from the `admins` table in the database.
*   The exploit utilizes a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject the malicious code into the SQL query.
*   The content also provides information like the vulnerable software name, platform (ASP), exploit date, and author.
