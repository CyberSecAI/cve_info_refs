    "description": "Masayuki Nakagawa discovered that flow labels were inadvertently being shared between listening sockets and child sockets. This defect can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (Oops).",

    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `ipv6_fl_socklist` from a listening socket is inadvertently shared with new sockets created for connections. The reference count isn't bumped and the object isn't cloned causing potential double frees and memory corruption.",

        "Incorrect handling of flow labels in IPv6",
        "Inadequate reference counting for shared objects"
      ],
      "impact": "Local users can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by triggering a kernel panic (Oops). Additionally, memory corruption could occur.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local users, by opening a listening IPv6 TCP socket and attaching a flow label, can trigger the vulnerability by connecting to that listening socket, and closing the connection.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local user access to the system."
