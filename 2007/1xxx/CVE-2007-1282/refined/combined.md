Package        : mozilla-firefox
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-1282 CVE-2007-0994 CVE-2007-0995 CVE-2007-0996 CVE-2007-0981 CVE-2007-0008 CVE-2007-0009 CVE-2007-0775 CVE-2007-0778 CVE-2007-0045 CVE-2006-6077

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox.

This will be the last security update of Mozilla-based products for
the oldstable (sarge) distribution of Debian. We recommend to upgrade
to stable (etch) as soon as possible.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:

CVE-2007-1282

    It was discovered that an integer overflow in text/enhanced message
    parsing allows the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0994

    It was discovered that a regression in the Javascript engine allows
    the execution of Javascript with elevated privileges.

CVE-2007-0995

    It was discovered that incorrect parsing of invalid HTML characters
    allows the bypass of content filters.

CVE-2007-0996

    It was discovered that insecure child frame handling allows cross-site
    scripting.

CVE-2007-0981

    It was discovered that Firefox handles URI withs a null byte in the
    hostname insecurely.

CVE-2007-0008

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0009

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the NSS code allows the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0775

    It was discovered that multiple programming errors in the layout engine
    allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-0778

    It was discovered that the page cache calculates hashes in an insecure
    manner.

CVE-2006-6077

    It was discovered that the password manager allows the disclosure of
    passwords.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge17. You should upgrade to etch as soon as possible.

The stable distribution (etch) isn't affected. These vulnerabilities have
been fixed prior to the release of Debian etch.

The unstable distribution (sid) no longer contains mozilla-firefox. Iceweasel
is already fixed.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

MailNews Core :: MIME
Problems with parsing the MIME structure and displaying messages. When this problem happens, it's often useful to attach a copy of the mail message generating the problem. If you have Communicator 4.x, you can select the message and save it as an .eml file (just save with the .eml extension). A few examples: 1. The contents of a message do not display properly. Certain items do not show up.

2 problems in MimeRichtextConvert
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/mailnews/mime/src/mimetric.cpp&rev=1.16>
106 seawood 1.13 // The code below must never expand the input by more than 5x;
107 mstoltz 1.12 // if it does, the desired\_size multiplier (5) below must be changed too
108 [1] desired\_size = (length \* 5) + 1;
109 rhp 1.1 [2] if (desired\_size >= \*obuffer\_sizeP)
110 status = mime\_GrowBuffer (desired\_size, sizeof(char), 1024,
111 obufferP, obuffer\_sizeP);
so 2 problems:
A) |desired\_size| may be negative even on 32 bit systems at the cost of
1.8G VM (~ 425M length).
the check at [2] is useless in this case.
B) on 64 bit systems [1] may overflow at the cost of about 3.6G VM
(~ 850M length). this may work in theory on 32 bit systems, but could reproduce it only on a 64 bit system.
stack from the negative case:

seems like it might be clearer to write something like:
0xfffffffe / BGROWTH
and it looks like there's a tab before the return -1.

imho this blocks both branches and with favorable heap layout is exploitable on 32 bit os - classic under allocation without exhausting the process memory space.
don't have cvs access so can't check in this.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200703-18**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Thunderbird, some of
which may allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.10** |

| Package | **mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.10** |

### Background

Mozilla Thunderbird is a popular open-source email client from the
Mozilla Project.

### Description

Georgi Guninski reported a possible integer overflow in the code
handling text/enhanced or text/richtext MIME emails. Additionally,
various researchers reported errors in the JavaScript engine
potentially leading to memory corruption. Additionally, the binary
version of Mozilla Thunderbird includes a vulnerable NSS library which
contains two possible buffer overflows involving the SSLv2 protocol.

### Impact

An attacker could entice a user to read a specially crafted email that
could trigger one of the vulnerabilities, some of them being related to
Mozilla Thunderbird's handling of JavaScript, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
some of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript. Note that the
execution of JavaScript is disabled by default and enabling it is
strongly discouraged.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.5.0.10"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.5.0.10"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-10

## Potential integer overflow with text/enhanced mail

Announced
March 5, 2007
Reporter
Georgi Guninski
Impact
Critical
Products
SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* SeaMonkey 1.0.8
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.10

### Description

Georgi Guninski discovered a potential integer overflow in the code
that handles mail formatted as text/enhanced or text/richtext. This
could in turn lead to a buffer overflow and potential code execution.

To exploit this flaw a malicious mail message would have to include
a line more than 400 megabytes long. Many mail systems have storage
quotas and transport filters that would prevent a message of that size
from reaching its destination, but should the message get through
its size would provide more than sufficient space for a payload.

### Workaround

Do not open mail messages that are megabytes in size unless the sender
is someone you know and from whom you were expecting that specific mail.
Delete the message without opening it by shutting the view pane (F8, or
from the "View | Layout" menu) before selecting the message in the thread
pane and then deleting.

Upgrade to a version containing the fix.

It creates .pyc (compiled bytecode python) files if they don't already exist.  This could very well happen whenever a python module is imported.  You may want to play with this. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Geert Bevin    2002-01-15 06:45:32 UTC  ``` See sandbox python modules [bug #44](show_bug.cgi?id=44 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"apparent\" sandbox violations when merging python modules") ``` |  |

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
