## Google Desktop vulnerable to cross-site scripting

#### Vulnerability Note VU#615857

Original Release Date: 2007-02-22 | Last Revised: 2007-02-27

---

### Overview

A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the Google Desktop Search application. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to take any action on a vulnerable system that the Google Desktop Search can.

### Description

| [Google Desktop Search](http://desktop.google.com/) is a desktop search program that is integrated into the Google search engine. Google Desktop Search indexes the user's local hard drive, and allows the results to be searched from a browser.  The Google Desktop Search program contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the under parameter. This vulnerability occurs because the Google Desktop Search engine fails to properly sanitize user input. Note that this vulnerability may not be exploited remotely without the presence of another vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to perform any action that the Google Desktop Search engine is capable of performing. This includes executing programs that are already on a vulnerable system, searching and viewing files and exfiltrating sensitive data. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Google has addressed this issue in the most recent version of the Google Desktop Search. Note that Google updates the Google Desktop Search [automatically](http://desktop.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=15935&topic=95). |
| --- |

| **Disable JavaScript**Disable JavaScript in your browser's preferences. Instructions for disabling JavaScript can be found in the [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/securing_browser/) document and the [Malicious Web Scripts FAQ](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_FAQ.html). Some Mozilla [add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/) can simplify the ability to enable or disable JavaScript, or set up site-specific rules for doing so. |

Hello,
A new research from Watchfire has revealed a serious vulnerability in
Google Desktop.
The attack, which is fully presented in a new Watchfire research paper
released today (available at
http://www.watchfire.com/resources/Overtaking-Google-Desktop.pdf), can
allow a malicious individual to achieve not only remote, persistent
access to sensitive data, but in some cases full system control as well.
Google Desktop is a popular freeware desktop search tool which offers
powerful indexing abilities along with an easy to use interface.
In many cases, Google Desktop manages highly sensitive information.
Therefore, the impact of a security breach in it is far-reaching.
Google Desktop contains several protection mechanisms to secure its
indexed data against remote intruders.
In this paper, we present a step-by-step attack flow that circumvents
Google Desktop's protection mechanisms and allows a malicious attack to
take place against Google Desktop users.
The attack is composed of web-application security flaws found in Google
Desktop along with exploitation of Google Desktop's tight integration
with the Google.com website.
The paper shows that it is possible to achieve a remote and persistent
access to sensitive data on attacked systems.
In addition, under certain conditions, it is also possible to covertly
inject and execute malicious applications on attacked systems, using
Google Desktop's own features.
The full paper can be found in the following link:
http://www.watchfire.com/resources/Overtaking-Google-Desktop.pdf
A demonstration of the attack flow can be found at the same page or at
the following link:
http://download.watchfire.com/googledesktopdemo/index.htm
Note:
-----
The Google Desktop security flaw was coordinated with the Google
Security Team.
Google has been responsive and recently issued a patch which mitigates
the risk of the attack.
We highly recommend all Google Desktop users to make sure they have an
updated version installed on their system.
This vulnerability was discovered by me with the cooperation of Danny
Allan and Adi Sharabani.
Best regards,
Yair Amit
