Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1085:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within Google Desktop Search. It arises because the application fails to properly sanitize user input, specifically within the "under" parameter. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core weakness is the lack of input sanitization, leading to an XSS vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Google Desktop application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Attackers can potentially execute programs on the victim's machine.
- Data exfiltration: Sensitive data indexed by Google Desktop can be accessed and extracted by an attacker.
- Full system control: Under certain circumstances, it is possible to covertly inject and execute malicious applications on attacked systems, using Google Desktop's own features.
- Persistent access: The attacker may be able to achieve persistent remote access to the compromised system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through web application security flaws in Google Desktop, combined with the tight integration of Google Desktop with the Google.com website. Specifically, the "under" parameter is vulnerable to malicious script injection.
- A separate vulnerability involving Internet Explorer was noted as being used to exploit the Google Desktop XSS, as mentioned in one of the provided links.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote unauthenticated attacker: The attacker can be remote and does not need any authentication credentials to begin exploitation.
- Requires another vulnerability:  The vulnerability cannot be exploited directly over the network and may require a separate vulnerability to trigger the exploit. (This is mentioned in the CERT document, but the Watchfire report indicates that it is indeed exploitable remotely.)
- Technical skills: Knowledge of XSS attacks and potentially web application vulnerabilities.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Yair Amit, Danny Allan, and Adi Sharabani from Watchfire.
- Google was notified and has released a patch to mitigate this vulnerability.
- A proof of concept was released by Watchfire demonstrating how to use the flaw, including a live demonstration on their website.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.6, an impact subscore of 10, and an exploitability subscore of 4.9, indicating a high level of severity.
- The attack complexity was rated as "High", but the exploit range is "Remote".
- The vendor has been responsive in addressing the issue.
