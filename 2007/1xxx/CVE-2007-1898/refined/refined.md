Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the email form of Jetbox CMS version 2.1. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data when constructing email headers, leading to email injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Email injection vulnerability.
- Lack of sanitization of user-provided input in the email form.
- Reliance on the PHP `register_globals` setting being enabled. This setting, which is considered insecure, allowed attackers to inject variables into the program's scope through HTTP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can send spam emails using the target site's mail server.
- Attackers can inject arbitrary email headers such as "Bcc," "From," and "Content-Type," allowing them to:
    - Send emails to arbitrary recipients.
    - Spoof the "From" address.
    - Send emails with malicious attachments.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited remotely through HTTP requests to the `formmail.php` script of the Jetbox CMS.
- Attackers manipulate the `recipient`, `subject`, and `_SETTINGS[allowed_email_hosts][]` parameters in the request URL to inject malicious email headers and content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Jetbox CMS server.
- The target server must have PHP's `register_globals` setting enabled for the exploit to work.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jesper Jurcenoks of netVigilance, Inc.
- The vendor, Streamedge Consultancy & Development, refused to fix the issue, stating that Jetbox is no longer maintained.
- A workaround is provided, which suggests disabling `register_globals` in the PHP configuration.
- A specific example of an attack is provided demonstrating how to inject email headers and content through the vulnerable parameters in the URL. This example also includes Bcc recipients, a custom "From:" address, and a multipart/mixed attachment.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity with a CVSS Base Score of 3.7.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a low target distribution on the internet.
