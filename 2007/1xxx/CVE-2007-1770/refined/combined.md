### Summary

This patch prevents the ArcSDE service from being affected by malicious connection packets.

### Description

NIM007075 - The giomgr can be crashed by sending extra characters in the connectiion string.

**Description**

A security issue has been identified where it is theoretically possible for someone to create a connection packet that could cause the ArcSDE server to crash when using three tiered ArcSDE configurations (i.e., app server). Sending a maliciously-crafted connection packet to an ArcSDE service can crash the service. This will not happen under normal use of the software and we are unaware of any occasion when anyone has created one of these malicious packets. Therefore ESRI considers the risk of an attack to be very low. As a precaution ESRI has developed this patch to ArcSDE that will remove the ability for someone to create a malicious packet that could cause the system to crash and thereby secures the ArcSDE service against such an attack

### Installing the Patch

[ArcSDE 9.1 General Update Patch 3](https://support.esri.com/en-us/patches-updates/2016/arcsde-9-1-general-update-patch-3-1198) must be installed before you can install this Patch. It is strongly recommended that you back up your database including all previous ArcSDE system tables and user layer data before upgrading your ArcSDE installation. Install this Patch using your SDE user account.

**REQUIRED INSTALL STEP:** If you connect to ArcSDE 9.1 via an Application Server and Direct Connect connections using ArcGIS 9.1, ArcIMS 9.1, or ArcView GIS 3.3 with DBA 2.1g make sure you also see [ESRI Products connecting to ArcSDE (Application and Direct Connect connections)](#install-ncUNIX).

### Server Install for UNIX

During installation, you can either save the original 9.1 files or overwrite them. If you choose to save them, make sure you have enough disk space. The disk space requirements, for each platform, are displayed during the installation process.

1. Download the appropriate tar file to a location other than $SDEHOME:

    - ArcGIS Workstation - <installation-folder>\arcexe9x\bin
    - ArcView GIS - <installation-folder>\av\_gis30\arcview\(bin32 & DCONNECT\LIB)
    - Depending on the ArcIMS Setup features installed, the SDE client file could be located in one or more of the following locations:
      * C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\bin
      * C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\ArcIMS\IndexBuilder
      * C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\ArcIMS\Metadata\Commands
      * C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\ArcIMS\Server\bin
  + **ArcIMS only**, restart ArcIMS Application Server, ArcIMS Monitor and ArcIMS Tasker (in that order).

### How to identify which Patch is installed

1. **UNIX**
    To find out what ArcGIS products are currently installed on your machine, download and extract the [PatchFinder.tar](http://downloads2.esri.com/Support/ServicePacks/91sp2/ArcGIS/ArcGISEngine91sp2.msp) and run PatchFinder utility from your local machine. This utility provides a report detailing which ArcGIS products and which servicepacks have been installed. The PatchFinder utility searches for thefollowing ArcGIS products.
   * ArcGIS Engine Runtime
   * ArcGIS Reader
   * ArcGIS Server
   * ArcIMS
   * ArcInfo Workstation
   * ArcSDE

   Extract the tar file by typing:

   `% tar xvf PatchFinder.tar`

   Run the utility by typing:

   `% ./PatchFinder`

    **Windows**

   To check for the presence of a Patch, for each file examine the unique identification information provided (right click, properties, version tab, item name, QFE Version). With only a few exceptions, all files modified as part of a Patch distribution can be uniquely identified in this manner. The identification string for this Patch should read:

   * `QFE-SDE-91-CQ00303306`

### Patch Updates

Check the Online Support Center periodically for the availability of additional Patches or Service Packs. New information about this Patch will be posted here.

* **UPDATE 04/11/2007 - Now Available:**

  + The ArcSDE Informix download for HP.
  + The ArcSDE SDK and ESRI Products downloads for HP.

  **UPDATE 04/03/2007 - Now Available:**

  + The ArcSDE Informix download for IBM.

### Getting Help

### Server Install for Windows

* #### Windows Installation Notes:

  + [ArcSDE 9.0 General Update Patch 3](#EsriSupport/index.cfm?fa=downloads.patchesServicePacks.viewPatch&PID=19&MetaID=1228) must be installed on the server and your client applications before you install this Patch.

#### Installation Steps

1. Make sure you have write access to the ArcSDE installation folder, that no one is using ArcSDE, and that the ArcSDE service is down.
2. Download the appropriate files to a location other than the ArcSDE installation folder:

   | **DB2** |  |
   | --- | --- |
   | [sde90-securitypatch-db2-win.exe](https://downloads.esri.com/Support/downloads/sde_/sde90-securitypatch-db2-win.EXE) | 1 MB |
   | **Informix** |  |
   | [sde90-securitypatch-inf-win.exe](https://downloads.esri.com/Support/downloads/sde_/sde90-securitypatch-inf-win.EXE) | 1 MB |
   | **SQL Server** |  |
   | [sde90-securitypatch-sql-win.exe](https://downloads.esri.com/Support/downloads/sde_/sde90-securitypatch-sql-win.EXE) | 1 MB |

   **For Oracle 8i/9i**, this issue has been addressed in a soon to be released ArcSDE 9.0 Reconcile and Post Patch. You'll be able to access it from this page once it's released
3. Double-click the appropriate executable to start the install process.
4. When Setup starts, follow the instructions on your screen.
5. As the SDE user, run the following command to restart the ArcSDE service:

   `sdemon -o start`

### How to identify which Patch is installed

1. **UNIX**

   Any modified UNIX executables (or libraries) being sent out as part of a Patch will return the unique identification number for that fix when checked with the "what" command for UNIX and the "strings" command for Linux. For example, to display the identification string for this Patch on UNIX, type:

   * `%what gsrvr.static | grep QFE`

     `QFE-SDE-90-CQ00303307`**Windows**

   To check for the presence of a Patch, for each file examine the unique identification information provided (right click, properties, version tab, item name, QFE Version). With only a few exceptions, all files modified as part of a Patch distribution can be uniquely identified in this manner. The identification string for this Patch should read:

   * `QFE-SDE-90-CQ00303307`

### Patch Updates

Check the Online Support Center periodically for the availability of additional Patches or Service Packs. New information about this Patch will be posted here.

* **UPDATE 04/11/2007 - Now Available:**

  + The ArcSDE Informix download for HP.

  **UPDATE 04/03/2007 - Now Available:**

  + The ArcSDE Informix download for IBM.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
