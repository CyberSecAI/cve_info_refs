Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-1564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the KDE FTP ioslave (specifically within Konqueror) parses the host address in the PASV (Passive Mode) response from an FTP server. This flawed parsing allows for potential exploitation via JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure FTP PASV Response Handling:** The KDE FTP ioslave does not properly sanitize or validate the host address in PASV responses, which is provided by the FTP server.
- **JavaScript Exploitation:** The ability to trigger FTP connections via JavaScript allowed for the exploitation of the flawed PASV handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Port Scanning:** An attacker can leverage the vulnerability to perform port scans of machines within the user's network. This can reveal information about services running on the user's internal network.
- **Information Disclosure:** The port scanning vulnerability can lead to private information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Websites:** A user can be tricked into visiting a malicious website containing JavaScript code designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **JavaScript Injection:**  Websites that allow JavaScript injection could be used to inject malicious code that leverages this vulnerability.
- **Malicious FTP Servers:** If a user is tricked into connecting to a malicious FTP server, the server can send crafted PASV responses to trigger the port scanning.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to serve malicious content:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious JavaScript code to the target's browser. This could be through hosting a malicious website, injecting JavaScript into a vulnerable website, or via a malicious FTP server.
- **Knowledge of target network (optional):** While not required for a general scan, knowing specific internal network address ranges increases the effectiveness of the port scan.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability could crash Konqueror, resulting in a denial-of-service.
- The vulnerability was present in KDE versions up to and including 3.5.6.
- Patches were provided by KDE for versions 3.4.x and 3.5.x.
- The vulnerability was triggered by javascript via malicious FTP server responses.
