Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists in FTP Voyager when processing a long 257 response to the PWD command. This overflow is triggered when the client sends a long string as part of the response and then hits the abort button.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack overflow: The program copies a large amount of data into a fixed-size buffer on the stack, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The overflow causes the application to crash, leading to a denial of service. The provided information states that only a DoS is achievable and that code execution is unlikely.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to connect to the vulnerable FTP server.
- The attacker sends a series of FTP commands.
- The attacker sends a long string as part of the 257 response to the PWD command and the user needs to disconnect for the crash to happen.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable FTP server.
- The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted FTP commands.
- The attacker doesn't need authentication.
