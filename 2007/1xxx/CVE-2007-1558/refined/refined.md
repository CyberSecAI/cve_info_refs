{
  "CVE-2007-1558": {
    "Root cause": "Cryptographic weakness in the APOP authentication protocol, specifically regarding MD5 collisions and predictable message IDs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Design flaw in the APOP protocol.",
      "Lack of sufficient message ID validation.",
      "Susceptibility to MD5 collision attacks."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can potentially recover the first 3 characters of a user's password through man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.",
      "Crafted message IDs to exploit MD5 collisions.",
      "Impersonating a trusted server."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to intercept network traffic, forge messages, and pose as a legitimate mail server to the targeted client.",
    "Affected products": [
      "Thunderbird 1.x before 1.5.0.12 and 2.x before 2.0.0.4",
      "Evolution",
      "mutt",
      "fetchmail (before 6.3.8)",
      "SeaMonkey 1.0.x before 1.0.9 and 1.1.x before 1.1.2",
      "Balsa 2.3.16 and earlier",
       "Icedove mail client (fixed in version 1.5.0.12.dfsg1-0etch1)",
      "Mailfilter before 0.8.2"
    ],
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious mail server by forging message IDs and exploiting MD5 collisions to guess portions of a user's password. A stricter validation of the message-ID format can mitigate this vulnerability, although the underlying design issue remains. Some sources mention that up to 31 characters of a password could be recovered. The vulnerability affects POP mail accounts using APOP authentication."
