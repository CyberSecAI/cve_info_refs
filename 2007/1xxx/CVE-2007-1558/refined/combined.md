Subject: mailfilter 0.8.2 fixes CVE-2007-1558 (APOP)

CVE-2007-1558:
  The APOP protocol allows remote attackers to guess the first 3
  characters of a password via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks that use
  crafted message IDs and MD5 collisions. NOTE: this design-level issue
  potentially affects all products that use APOP, including (1)
  Thunderbird 1.x before 1.5.0.12 and 2.x before 2.0.0.4, (2) Evolution,
  (3) mutt, (4) fetchmail, (5) SeaMonkey 1.0.x before 1.0.9 and 1.1.x
  before 1.1.2, (6) Balsa 2.3.16 and earlier, and possibly other
  products.

Mailfilter 0.8.2 is now out and added the mitigation mutt added a while
ago: <http://mailfilter.sourceforge.net/NEWS>

If you need the patch:

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [fetchmail](/security/cves?package=fetchmail) -

## Details

Gaetan Leurent discovered a vulnerability in the APOP protocol based

on MD5 collisions. As fetchmail supports the APOP protocol, this

vulnerability can be used by attackers to discover a portion of the APOP

user's authentication credentials. ([CVE-2007-1558](/security/CVE-2007-1558))

Earl Chew discovered that fetchmail can be made to de-reference a NULL

pointer when contacting SMTP servers. This vulnerability can be used

by attackers who control the SMTP server to crash fetchmail and cause

a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-4565](/security/CVE-2007-4565))

### Reduce your security exposure

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* [fetchmail](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/fetchmail)
  -
  [6.3.6-1ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/fetchmail/6.3.6-1ubuntu2.1)

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* [fetchmail](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/fetchmail)
  -

Package        : icedove
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-1558 CVE-2007-2867 CVE-2007-2868

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Icedove mail client,
an unbranded version of the Thunderbird client. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-1558

    Gatan Leurent discovered a cryptographical weakness in APOP
    authentication, which reduces the required efforts for an MITM attack
    to intercept a password. The update enforces stricter validation, which
    prevents this attack.

CVE-2007-2867

    Boris Zbarsky, Eli Friedman, Georgi Guninski, Jesse Ruderman, Martijn
    Wargers and Olli Pettay discovered crashes in the layout engine, which
    might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-2868

    Brendan Eich, Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman, moz_bug_r_a4 and Wladimir Palant
    discovered crashes in the Javascript engine, which might allow the execution of
    arbitrary code. Generally, enabling Javascript in Icedove is not recommended.

Fixes for the oldstable distribution (sarge) are not available. While there
will be another round of security updates for Mozilla products, Debian doesn't
have the ressources to backport further security fixes to the old Mozilla
products. You're strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable as soon as possible.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version
1.5.0.12.dfsg1-0etch1.

The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

# USN-469-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

6 June 2007

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Gaëtan Leurent showed a weakness in APOP authentication. An attacker

posing as a trusted server could recover portions of the user's

password via multiple authentication attempts. ([CVE-2007-1558](/security/CVE-2007-1558))

Various flaws were discovered in the layout and JavaScript engines. By

tricking a user into opening a malicious email, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the user's privileges. Please note that JavaScript

is disabled by default for emails, and it is not recommended to enable

it. ([CVE-2007-2867](/security/CVE-2007-2867), [CVE-2007-2868](/security/CVE-2007-2868))

### Reduce your security exposure

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* mozilla-thunderbird
  -
  1.5.0.12-0ubuntu0.7.04

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* mozilla-thunderbird
  -
  1.5.0.12-0ubuntu0.6.10

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* mozilla-thunderbird
  -
  1.5.0.12-0ubuntu0.6.06

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to effect

the necessary changes.

# Fetchmail

Fetchmail ist ein vollwertiges, robustes, gut dokumentiertes Dienstprogramm zum Abrufen und Weiterleiten von Remote-Mails, das für die Verwendung über On-Demand-TCP/IP-Verbindungen (wie SLIP- oder PPP-Verbindungen) vorgesehen ist. Es unterstützt jedes Remote-Mail-Protokoll, das derzeit im Internet verwendet wird: POP2, POP3, RPOP, APOP, KPOP, alle Varianten von IMAP, ETRN und ODMR. Es kann sogar IPv6 und IPSEC unterstützen.

Fetchmail ruft E-Mails von entfernten Mail-Servern ab und leitet sie über SMTP weiter, so dass sie dann von normalen Mail-Benutzeragenten wie mutt, elm oder BSD Mail gelesen werden können. Es ermöglicht es allen Filter-, Weiterleitungs- und Aliasing-Funktionen Ihres System-MTAs, genauso zu arbeiten wie auf normalen E-Mails.

Fetchmail bietet einen besseren Schutz vor Passwortsniffing als jeder andere Unix-Remote-Mail-Client. Es unterstützt APOP, KPOP, OTP, Compuserve RPA, Microsoft NTLM und IMAP RFC1731 verschlüsselte Authentifizierungsmethoden einschließlich CRAM-MD5, um das Senden von Passwörtern en clair zu vermeiden. Es kann konfiguriert werden, um eine End-to-End-Verschlüsselung über Tunneling mit ssh, der Secure Shell, zu unterstützen.

Fetchmail kann als POP/IMAP-zu-SMTP-Gateway für eine gesamte DNS-Domäne verwendet werden, indem E-Mails aus einer einzigen Dropdown-Box auf einem ISP gesammelt und SMTP basierend auf Kopfadressen weitergeleitet werden. (Wir empfehlen dies jedoch nicht wirklich, da es wichtige Informationen über den Kuvertkopf verlieren kann. ETRN oder eine UUCP-Verbindung ist besser.)

Fetchmail kann automatisch und geräuschlos als Systemdämon beim Booten gestartet werden. Wenn man in diesem Modus mit einem kurzen Poll-Intervall läuft, ist es für jeden ziemlich schwer zu sagen, dass der eingehende Mail-Link keine Vollzeit- „Push“-Verbindung ist.

Fetchmail ist einfach zu konfigurieren. Sie können die Dotfile direkt bearbeiten oder den interaktiven GUI-Konfigurator (fetchmailconf) verwenden, der mit der fetchmail-Distribution geliefert wird. Es wird auch direkt in linuxconf Versionen 1.16r8 und höher unterstützt.

Fetchmail ist schnell und leicht. Es enthält alle seine Standardfunktionen (POP3-, IMAP- und ETRN-Unterstützung) in 196K Core auf einem Pentium unter Linux.

Fetchmail ist eine Open-Source- und kostenlose Software.

## Download

Fetchmail Download unter <https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/>

## Alternative

Eine gute Alternative ist getmail.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser from the Mozilla Project,
and Mozilla Thunderbird an email client. The SeaMonkey project is a
community effort to deliver production-quality releases of code derived
from the application formerly known as the 'Mozilla Application Suite'.
XULRunner is a Mozilla runtime package that can be used to bootstrap
XUL+XPCOM applications like Firefox and Thunderbird.

### Description

Mozilla developers fixed several bugs involving memory corruption
through various vectors (CVE-2007-2867, CVE-2007-2868). Additionally,
several errors leading to crash, memory exhaustion or CPU consumption
were fixed (CVE-2007-1362, CVE-2007-2869). Finally, errors related to
the APOP protocol (CVE-2007-1558), XSS prevention (CVE-2007-2870) and
spoofing prevention (CVE-2007-2871) were fixed.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to
the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service. It is also
possible for an attacker to spoof the address bar or other browser
elements, obtain sensitive APOP information, or perform cross-site
scripting attacks, leading to the exposure of sensitive information,
like user credentials.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.4"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.4"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-2.0.0.4"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-2.0.0.4"
```

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-15

## Security Vulnerability in APOP Authentication

Announced
May 30, 2007
Reporter
Gaëtan Leurent
Impact
Moderate
Products
SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* SeaMonkey 1.0.9
* SeaMonkey 1.1.2
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.12
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.4

### Description

**Gaëtan Leurent** informed us of a weakness in APOP
authentication that could allow an attacker to recover the first
part of your mail password if the attacker could interpose
a malicious mail server on your network masquerading as your legitimate
mail server. With normal settings it could take several hours for
the attacker to gather enough data to recover just a few characters
of the password. This result was presented at the
*Fast Software Encryption 2007* conference.

In a rump session at the same conference a team from The University of
Electro-Communications claimed that a variant on the same hash-collision
attack allowed them to recover a 31 character password.

Fixed versions of Thunderbird and SeaMonkey mail prevent this
technique by stricter enforcement of the Message-ID format used
by APOP.

POP mail accounts which do not use any authentication are
common and in the same hypothetical situation the password could
be recovered immediately without any special programming on the
attacker's part.

### Workaround

Upgrade to a fixed version of the client if your mail account
uses APOP authentication.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : iceape
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-1362 CVE-2007-1558 CVE-2007-2867 CVE-2007-2868 CVE-2007-2870 CVE-2007-2871

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceape internet
suite, an unbranded version of the Seamonkey Internet Suite. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-1362

    Nicolas Derouet discovered that Iceape performs insufficient
    validation of cookies, which could lead to denial of service.

CVE-2007-1558

    Gatan Leurent discovered a cryptographical weakness in APOP
    authentication, which reduces the required efforts for an MITM attack
    to intercept a password. The update enforces stricter validation, which
    prevents this attack.

CVE-2007-2867

    Boris Zbarsky, Eli Friedman, Georgi Guninski, Jesse Ruderman, Martijn
    Wargers and Olli Pettay discovered crashes in the layout engine, which
    might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-2868

    Brendan Eich, Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman, moz_bug_r_a4 and Wladimir Palant
    discovered crashes in the javascript engine, which might allow the execution of
    arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-2870

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that adding an event listener through the
     addEventListener() function allows cross-site scripting.

CVE-2007-2871

    Chris Thomas discovered that XUL popups can can be abused for spoofing or
    phishing attacks.

Fixes for the oldstable distribution (sarge) are not available. While there
will be another round of security updates for Mozilla products, Debian doesn't
have the ressources to backport further security fixes to the old Mozilla
products. You're strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable as soon as possible.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version
1.0.9-0etch1. A build for the arm architecture is not yet available, it will
be provided later.

The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

# fetchmail 6.3.2-2ubuntu2.2 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
fetchmail (6.3.2-2ubuntu2.2) dapper-security; urgency=low

  * SECURITY UPDATE: DoS via NULL pointer dereference when SMTP refuses to
    send certain warning messages
  * added 05_CVE-2007-4565.dpatch to sink.c to verify msg is not NULL
  * SECURITY UPDATE: Due to a design flaw in the APOP protocol, remote
    attackers may be able to acquire a portion of a user's authentication
    credentials using man-in-the-middle techniques.
  * added 06_CVE-2007-1558.dpatch.  This patch adds notes about APOP's
    limitations as well as updating pop3.c to more strictly validate the
    presented challenge for RFC-822 conformity. This change to pop3.c does
    not fix the APOP design flaw, but does make attacks against APOP somewhat
    more difficult.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
