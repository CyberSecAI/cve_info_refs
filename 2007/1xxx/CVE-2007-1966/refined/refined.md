The provided content is related to CVE-2007-1966. It describes two vulnerabilities found in eXV2 CMS versions 2.0.4.3 and earlier: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Session Fixation.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root cause:** The "set_lang" parameter in "archive.php", "article.php", "index.php", and "topics.php" does not properly sanitize user-supplied input.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Lack of input sanitization.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code into a user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities within the context of the vulnerable website.
*   **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `set_lang` parameter.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking a crafted URL.

**Session Fixation:**

*   **Root cause:** The application allows setting the `PHPSESSID` cookie to an arbitrary value.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The application accepts session identifiers from GET/POST variables, doesn't regenerate session IDs on each request, and accepts server-generated or non-server generated IDs.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a user's session ID to a predefined value. After the user logs in, the attacker can use the fixed session ID to assume their online identity.
*   **Attack vectors:** By setting the `PHPSESSID` cookie to a predefined value or using GET/POST variables.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to lure the victim to a malicious link/page that sets the `PHPSESSID`.

The advisory also provides workarounds for both vulnerabilities:

*   For XSS, it recommends using `htmlspecialchars()` or `htmlentities()` PHP functions to properly sanitize input.
*   For session fixation, it recommends:
    1.  Not accepting session identifiers from GET/POST variables.
    2.  Regenerating session IDs on each request.
    3.  Only accepting server-generated session IDs.
