Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `id` parameter of the `index.php` file in the Tiny Event module for XOOPS.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. This means that the attacker can inject SQL code, but the results of the query are not directly displayed to the user. The attacker must infer the results by observing changes in the application's behavior (e.g., error messages, response time, etc.)
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database. In this specific example, the exploit attempts to extract usernames and passwords of users from the `xoops_users` table, which could lead to unauthorized access and control of the XOOPS application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file of the Tiny Event module. The `id` parameter is manipulated to inject SQL code.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable XOOPS application. This can typically be done remotely and does not require prior access or authentication. The attacker needs to have some understanding of SQL syntax and the structure of the database.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided exploit code is a Perl script designed to automate the SQL injection. It takes the target server and the path to the module directory as input, and also requires the user ID to target.
*   The exploit script constructs a SQL injection payload that uses `UNION SELECT` to concatenate the username and password from the `xoops_users` table.
*   The script then sends an HTTP GET request with the malicious payload to the vulnerable application.
*   The response is analyzed for strings that match patterns associated with usernames and passwords.
