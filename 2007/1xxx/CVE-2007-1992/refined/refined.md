{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an insecure use of the `$mosConfig_absolute_path` variable in the `EXIF.php` and `EXIF_Makernote.php` files. This allows a remote attacker to include arbitrary files from a remote location.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious URL in the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and needs a publicly accessible web server to host the malicious PHP file."
