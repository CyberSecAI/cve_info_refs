{
  "CVE-2007-1660": {
    "description": "Multiple forms of character class had their sizes miscalculated on initial passes, resulting in too little memory being allocated.",
    "extracted_data": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an error in the PCRE library where the sizes for \"multiple forms of character class\" were miscalculated during the initial parsing, leading to insufficient memory allocation.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted regular expression to applications using the vulnerable PCRE library. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code, a denial of service (DoS), or the disclosure of sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted regular expressions"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted regular expression to an application using the vulnerable PCRE library.",
      "more_info": "This issue was also fixed in version 7.0 of PCRE where the compiler was re-engineered. Multiple integer overflows in the processing of escape sequences could also result in heap overflows or out-of-bounds reads/writes."
