```
Root cause of vulnerability: The application uses unsanitized input for the `$ROOTDIR` variable in `createemails.inc.php` and `send_emails.inc.php`. The include function then uses this unsanitized variable, leading to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a remote malicious PHP script, allowing for arbitrary code execution on the server.
Attack vectors: HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts (`createemails.inc.php` and `send_emails.inc.php`) by providing a malicious URL to the `$ROOTDIR` parameter.
Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application and must also have a server to host the malicious payload. The vulnerable server must have the `register_globals` setting turned on, `allow_fopenurl` turned on in PHP.
