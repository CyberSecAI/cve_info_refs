Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1359:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from mod_security's handling of NULL characters within POST requests using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding. Mod_security interprets these NULL characters as string terminators, unlike other parsers used by web applications.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The vulnerability is a rule bypass issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can bypass mod\_security rules by sending a crafted POST request with NULL characters.
- Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code in the context of the web server with the privileges of the user running the web server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote.
- It involves sending specially crafted POST requests using the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding type, embedding NULL characters to manipulate how mod_security processes the data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to a web server protected by a vulnerable version of mod_security.
- No specific privilege is needed to exploit this vulnerability as the attack is via HTTP request to a web server.
