Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** flaw in Weatimages 1.7.1. This means the application allows an attacker to include a remote file into the application by manipulating the `ini[langpack]` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input provided through the `ini[langpack]` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject a URL pointing to a malicious file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to a full compromise of the web server and potentially the entire network, depending on the server setup and permissions.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the server or modify the application to include backdoors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector is through the `ini[langpack]` parameter in the URL, which can be manipulated to include a remote file. For example:
    ```
    http://www.nazarkin.name/projects/weatimages/demo/index.php?ini[langpack]=shelladress
    ```
    In this example, "shelladress" would be the URL of a file under the attacker's control

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:**  The attacker does not need any prior access to the server.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*  **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that `ini[langpack]` is vulnerable and how to utilize it.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided exploit-db entry notes that the vulnerability doesn't exist if `weatimages.ini` file is uploaded, because the ini configuration would not be loaded through a remote parameter.
*   The exploit-db entry includes a Google dork: `inurl: index.php?ini[langpack]=` which allows to quickly identify vulnerable websites.
