Hi, i've tested a simple way to bypass the phishing protection in Firefox 2.0.0.3 and Opera 9.10. Aparently both browsers fails to detect a phishing site if it is embeded in an IFRAME / OBJECT label.
I've released some demostrations to test the above:
http://zonafirefox.googlepages.com/prueba.html (using Javascript to create an iframe object)
http://zonafirefox.googlepages.com/prueba2.html
(without Javascript)
Also, the following code can be used to bypass the phishing protection:
"<object type="text/html" classid="(phishing site)" data="(phishing site)"></object>"
The tests were realized using several many sites from Phishtank database. IE7 has no problems.
Any feedback and/or confirmation of the above will be very appreciated.
rgds,
nsp
