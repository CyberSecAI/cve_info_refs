Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-1756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a calculation error where Microsoft Excel does not correctly validate version information when handling malformed Excel files. This leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper validation of version information in malformed Excel files.
- The vulnerability is present in the way Excel handles specially crafted Excel files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code as the logged-on user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take full control of the affected system.
- This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new user accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **E-mail:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Excel file as an attachment and convince the user to open it.
- **Web-based:** An attacker can host a website containing a malicious Excel file or compromise existing websites with the crafted file, then persuade users to visit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malformed Excel file.
- Ability to deliver the crafted file to the victim, either by email or by hosting the file on a webserver.
- Social engineering skills are required to convince the victim to open the file.
- The attacker gains the same user rights as the user who opens the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Microsoft Excel validates version related data.
- The Microsoft document also mentions mitigation factors like using the "Office Document Open Confirmation Tool", which prompts the user before opening documents.
- Workarounds include using the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) or the File Block policy.
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office 2000 (critical) and, to a lesser degree, Office XP, 2003, 2004 for Mac, 2007 Office System, and Office Compatibility Pack (important).
