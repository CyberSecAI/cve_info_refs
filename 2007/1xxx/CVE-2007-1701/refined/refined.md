The provided content includes a Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 200705-19) that lists multiple vulnerabilities affecting PHP. CVE-2007-1701 is mentioned within this advisory, alongside other CVEs related to the same set of PHP vulnerabilities.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The advisory describes multiple vulnerabilities in PHP, including an integer overflow in the GD library's `wbmp.c` (CVE-2007-1001) and in the `substr_compare()` function (CVE-2007-1375). Additionally, it mentions buffer overflows in `make_http_soap_request()` (CVE-2007-2510) and `user_filter_factory_create()` (CVE-2007-2511), as well as a buffer overflow in the XMLRPC library (CVE-2007-1864). Double-free vulnerabilities were also found in `session_regenerate_id()` (CVE-2007-1484) and `array_user_key_compare()` (CVE-2007-1521). Finally, implementation errors were noted in the Zend engine, `mb_parse_str()`, `unserialize()`, and `mail()` functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Integer overflows
    - Buffer overflows
    - Double-free vulnerabilities
    - Implementation errors in various functions of the PHP core
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, cause denial of service, execute scripted content in the context of the affected site, bypass security restrictions, or leak information.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attacks via PHP applications using the vulnerable functions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker able to access PHP applications using vulnerable functions.

The advisory explicitly lists CVE-2007-1701, but does not provide specific details for this vulnerability. Instead, it groups it with multiple other CVEs that affect the same PHP release, and it describes the general types of vulnerabilities and their potential impact.
