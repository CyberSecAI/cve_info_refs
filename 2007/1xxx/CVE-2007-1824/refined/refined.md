Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2007-1824:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An off-by-one error exists in the `php_stream_filter_create()` function within the PHP filtering framework when handling wildcards.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Off-by-one buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote crash of the PHP interpreter.
- The vulnerability could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code, depending on the specific context and application setup (as mentioned in the Debian advisory).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by passing malformed input that exploits the off-by-one error during the wildcard handling in `php_stream_filter_create()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send crafted input to a PHP application that uses the affected filtering mechanism.
- The attacker is required to interact with the PHP application through the network or other means, depending on the application design, to trigger the vulnerable code path.
