{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows including local files by manipulating the 'lang' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, which can lead to sensitive information disclosure and potentially arbitrary code execution if the attacker can include a file containing malicious code.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request with a 'lang' parameter that contains the path to the file to be included, followed by a null byte (%00) to bypass file extension checks.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special access is needed as the vulnerability is triggered through a GET parameter."
