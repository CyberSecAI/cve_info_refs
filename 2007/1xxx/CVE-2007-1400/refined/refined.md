  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Plash sandbox allowing a sandboxed process to use the TIOCSTI ioctl() on the terminal file descriptor.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient access control",
        "Unrestricted use of TIOCSTI ioctl()"
      ],
      "impact": "A sandboxed process can insert characters into the input stream of the user's terminal, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary commands with the user's privileges.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Abuse of the TIOCSTI ioctl() on the terminal file descriptor by a sandboxed process"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a Plash sandbox."
