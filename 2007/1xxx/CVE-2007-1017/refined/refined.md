Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1017:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. It arises from the `newsordner` parameter in the `show_news_inc.php` script not being properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to include a remote file containing malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The application includes a file specified by the attacker through the `newsordner` parameter without proper validation, allowing code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious PHP script from a remote location.
- Full System Compromise: Successful exploitation could lead to complete control of the vulnerable web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: An attacker sends a crafted GET request to the `show_news_inc.php` script, providing the URL of a malicious script in the `newsordner` parameter.
- The vulnerable parameter is `newsordner` in `show_news_inc.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable web server.
- Ability to host a malicious PHP script: The attacker needs a publicly accessible server to host the malicious PHP script that will be included on the victim's server.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit code provided in the Exploit-DB entry shows how to craft the malicious URL and send it to the vulnerable server.
- The vulnerable application is identified as VS-News-System version 1.2.1 or earlier.
- The included code snippets highlight the specific vulnerable line in `show_news_inc.php`.
- This is a basic Remote File Inclusion vulnerability, and it's implied there's no input sanitization or filtering of the `newsordner` parameter.
