The provided content describes multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Phpwebgallery version 1.4.1.

- **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input in several files, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - `register.php`: The `login` and `mail_address` fields are vulnerable.
  - `search.php`: The `search_author`, `mode`, `start_year`, `end_year`, and `date_type` parameters are vulnerable.
- **Attack Vector:** Remote.
- **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the affected web pages.  The CVSS score indicates a partial impact on integrity, meaning an attacker could modify some content.
- **Required Capabilities:** No authentication required. Medium attack complexity.
