{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The BrowseDialog Class (ccrpbds6.dll) has multiple methods that are unable to handle long strings, leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation in the 'IsFolderAvailable' and 'RootFolder' methods. These methods crash when processing overly long string arguments.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in a denial of service. The application using the vulnerable DLL will likely crash when the affected methods are called with long strings. This could cause the service/application to become unavailable.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending overly long strings to the `IsFolderAvailable` or `RootFolder` methods of the `BrowseDialog` ActiveX object.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute a script or application that can instantiate the vulnerable ActiveX object and call the vulnerable methods with long string inputs. This could be achieved through a web page or malicious application."
