  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `module.php` script in Digital Eye CMS 0.1.1b uses an unsanitized `menu` parameter in a `require_once()` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `menu` parameter in the `module.php` script via an HTTP GET request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a malicious script."
