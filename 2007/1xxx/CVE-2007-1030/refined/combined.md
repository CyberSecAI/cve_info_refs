How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Sponsors

[![AppNexus Logo](images/sm-web-appnexus-logo.png)](http://appnexus.com/)Thanks to [AppNexus](http://appnexus.com/) for sponsoring Libevent development in 2012!

The *libevent* API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. Furthermore, *libevent* also support callbacks due to **signals** or regular **timeouts**.

*libevent* is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven network servers. An application just needs to call *event\_dispatch()* and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change the event loop.

Currently, *libevent* supports *[/dev/poll](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E19253-01/816-5177/6mbbc4g9n/index.html)*, *[kqueue(2)](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kqueue&apropos=0&sektion=0&format=html)*, *[event ports](http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/event_completion.html)*, [POSIX *select(2)*](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=select), [Windows *select()*](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms740141%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx), [*poll(2)*](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=poll), and *[epoll(4)](http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/epoll.txt)*. The internal event mechanism is completely independent of the exposed event API, and a simple update of libevent can provide new functionality without having to redesign the applications. As a result, *Libevent* allows for portable application
development and provides the most scalable event notification mechanism available on an operating system. Libevent can also be used for multi-threaded applications, either by isolating each event\_base so that only a single thread accesses it, or by locked access to a single shared event\_base. *Libevent* should compile on Linux, \*BSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, Windows, and more.

Libevent additionally provides a sophisticated framework for buffered network IO, with support for sockets, filters, rate-limiting, SSL, zero-copy file transmission, and IOCP. Libevent includes support for several useful protocols, including DNS, HTTP, and a minimal RPC framework.

More information about event notification mechanisms for network servers can be found on Dan Kegel's "[The C10K problem](http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html)" web page.

### [Older Releases](old-releases.html)

Libevent has been released under a [3-clause BSD license](LICENSE.txt). Information on public [git](https://github.com/libevent/libevent) access.

### Benchmark

Performance comparison using different event notification mechansims in Libevent. We declare interest in a large number of connections of which most are cold and only a few are active.

| Benchmarks with one active connection |  | Benchmarks with 100 active connections |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The benchmark measures how long it takes to serve one active connection and exposes scalability issues of traditional interfaces like select or poll. |  | The benchmark measures how long it takes to serve one hundred active connections that chain writes to new connections until thousand writes and reads have happened. It exercises the event loop several times. |
