When we search "Copyright (c) 2004 by Sam Tang" there is only one
result (1) and on the server, the php is not interpreted ... we can
read the source code. The title of the script is not "stat12" but "PHP
i-Stats". The website (2) of the author is down. The file inclusion
will not work : require_once('global.php');...define('LANGPATH',
'lang/');

Darkfig,

Agreed - I accidentally did a similar investigation because I forgot you
had posted this :)

I have no idea where the "stat12" came from since it's not part of the
live site that appears to have the unparsed i-Stats code.

If you change the "counter.php" on the live site to index.php, which was
the program in the original disclosure, you have:

  require_once(LANGPATH . $cfg['langFile']);

which obviously is not a "langpath" parameter.

Hey Gadi - RaeD seems to be one of the worst offenders right now and
identifies as Israeli.  Do you feel like using your subtle,
non-confrontational style to see if he can change his ways?  ;-)

- Steve
