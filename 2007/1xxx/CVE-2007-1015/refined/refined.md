  "CVE-2007-1015": {
    "related_to_cve": true,
    "description": "Aktueldownload Haber scripti is vulnerable to SQL injection via the 'id' parameter in HaberDetay.asp. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive data like usernames and passwords from the 'ayar' table.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'id' parameter in HaberDetay.asp, before using it in an SQL query.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to: \n- Disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., usernames, passwords).\n- Modification or deletion of data.\n- Potential full compromise of the database.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the HaberDetay.asp script."

      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, and have knowledge of SQL."
      ],
        "exploit": "The provided exploit is `HaberDetay.asp?id=-1+union+select+0,1,kadi,4,5,parola,7+from+ayar`. This crafted URL injects an SQL query into the `id` parameter, bypassing the intended query and extracting the `kadi` (username) and `parola` (password) fields from the `ayar` table."
