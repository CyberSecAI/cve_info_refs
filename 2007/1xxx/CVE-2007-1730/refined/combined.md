# USN-464-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

24 May 2007

Linux kernel vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Philipp Richter discovered that the AppleTalk protocol handler did

not sufficiently verify the length of packets. By sending a crafted

AppleTalk packet, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the

kernel. ([CVE-2007-1357](/security/CVE-2007-1357))

Gabriel Campana discovered that the do\_ipv6\_setsockopt() function did

not sufficiently verifiy option values for IPV6\_RTHDR. A local

attacker could exploit this to trigger a kernel crash. ([CVE-2007-1388](/security/CVE-2007-1388))

A Denial of Service vulnerability was discovered in the

nfnetlink\_log() netfilter function. A remote attacker could exploit

this to trigger a kernel crash. ([CVE-2007-1496](/security/CVE-2007-1496))

The connection tracking module for IPv6 did not properly handle the

status field when reassembling fragmented packets, so that the final

packet always had the 'established' state. A remote attacker could

exploit this to bypass intended firewall rules. ([CVE-2007-1497](/security/CVE-2007-1497))

Masayuki Nakagawa discovered an error in the flowlabel handling of

IPv6 network sockets. A local attacker could exploit this to crash

the kernel. ([CVE-2007-1592](/security/CVE-2007-1592))

The do\_dccp\_getsockopt() function did not sufficiently verify the

optlen argument. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel

memory (which might expose sensitive data) or cause a kernel crash.

This only affects Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-1730](/security/CVE-2007-1730))

The IPv4 and DECnet network protocol handlers incorrectly declared

an array variable so that it became smaller than intended. By sending

crafted packets over a netlink socket, a local attacker could exploit

this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2007-2172](/security/CVE-2007-2172))

David,

	Please push for 2.6.21 and stable (CCed for good measure).

-----------------------------------

We were only checking if there was enough space to put the int, but left len as
specified by the (malicious) user, sigh, fix it by setting len to sizeof(val) and
transfering just one int worth of data, the one asked for.

Also check for negative len values.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
