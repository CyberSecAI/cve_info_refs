{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `do_dccp_getsockopt()` function in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the `optlen` argument, allowing a local attacker to read kernel memory or cause a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
       "Improper bounds check"
    ],
    "impact": "Local attackers could exploit this vulnerability to either read sensitive kernel memory, potentially leaking information, or trigger a kernel crash leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must be able to call the `getsockopt` function with the crafted `optlen` argument.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access is required to make the vulnerable system call."
  }
