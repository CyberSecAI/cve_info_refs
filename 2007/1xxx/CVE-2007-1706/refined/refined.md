```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The eWebQuiz application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the 'QuizID' parameter within the 'eWebQuiz.asp' script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This could allow them to extract sensitive data (like usernames and password hashes), modify data, or potentially gain further access to the server.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exposed via the web interface. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a modified 'QuizID' parameter containing SQL code.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and application. They do not need any special privileges on the server or application.
