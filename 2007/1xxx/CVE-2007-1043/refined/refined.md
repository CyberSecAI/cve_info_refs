Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Ezboo webstats application has a vulnerability that allows direct access to sensitive files via URL manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Direct File Access:** The application fails to properly restrict access to sensitive files such as `update.php` and `config.php`.
- **Lack of Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to implement proper access controls, allowing unauthorized users to directly request and access these files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can access sensitive information contained within `config.php` and `update.php` which might include database credentials, application configurations, and other sensitive information.
- **Partial Confidentiality Impact:** Exposure of configuration files and potentially sensitive data.
- **Partial Integrity Impact:** Possible modification of application behavior by manipulating settings.
- **Partial Availability Impact:** If database credentials are leaked, it could lead to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **URL Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by simply adding the vulnerable file paths (`update.php` or `config.php`) to the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target application.
