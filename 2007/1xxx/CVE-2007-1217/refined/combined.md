| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=8028#c0)  Ben Hutchings    2007-02-17 13:02:58 UTC  ``` See <http://bugs.debian.org/408530> for an example of Asterisk crashing when calling these debugging extensions to CAPI.  The same functions and implementations are present in the kernel and are used in several logging calls. I don't see any sign of locking or other measures that would make this thread-safe. The Debian bug report suggests that some messages can overflow the 8 KB buffer. I don't know enough about the protocol to tell whether this is a result of two threads trying to convert a message at the same time or whether it can result from a single long message. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=8028#c1)  Ben Hutchings    2007-02-18 07:01:42 UTC  ``` The Debian bug report for the kernel is now <http://bugs.debian.org/411294> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=8028#c2)  Karsten Keil    2007-02-25 05:55:27 UTC  ``` Note: this code was never for production use, it only was some helper to debug  CAPI applications, but you are correct this should be fixed.

Subject: libcapi20-3: buffer overflow in "printbuf" called from capi\_cmsg2str
Date: Fri, 26 Jan 2007 16:34:32 +0100
```
Package: libcapi20-3
Version: 1:3.9.20060704-2.2
Severity: important

the bufprint routine used by capi_cmsg2str does an unbounded vsprintf
into a 8192 byte buffer, perhaps hoping it's big enough.

It isn't.

Looks like someone needs some vsnprintf like training wheels.

If the content of that vsprintf can be controlled by remote peers,
this may lead to a remote security hole for daemons using CAPI
(pppd-capi-plugin, asterisk-chan-capi, capi4hylafax, ...). Or a DoS.

If the content of that vsprintf can be controlled by local users
making use of a system service (such as sending a fax, making a phone
call, ...) that uses CAPI, this is a privilege escalation or remote
authenticated user security hole, or a DoS.

If someone determines this is not exploitable, feel free to remove
security tag and take severity down to important again.

This function and capi_message2str are not thread-safe either; nor can
they be made so without the use of TSS for their buffers.  chan_capi
will need to use a mutex to prevent collision between concurrent uses of
these functions.  I don't know what can be done in the kernel.  The
buffer overflow could conceivably be due to two concurrent calls to
these functions rather than a single message.

Ben.

It is easier to change the specification to fit the program than vice versa.

I can't test this in place because I don't know how to construct a
message that would overflow the buffer.  However, the following test
program:

-- BEGIN --
static char buf[8192];
static char *p = 0;

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

static void bufprint(char *fmt,...)
{
	va_list f;
	size_t space = buf + sizeof(buf) - p, len;
	va_start(f, fmt);
	len = vsnprintf(p, space, fmt, f);
	va_end(f);
	if (len < space - 1)
		p += len;
	else
		p += space - 1;
}

int main(void)
{
    int i;
    p = buf;
    p[0] = 0;
    for (i = 0; i != 10; ++i)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# capi4k-utils: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200704-23**

capi4k-utils is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the bufprint() function.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-dialup/capi4k-utils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **20050718-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **20050718-r3** |

### Background

capi4k-utils is a set of utilities for accessing COMMON-ISDN-API
software interfaces for ISDN devices.

### Description

The bufprint() function in capi4k-utils fails to properly check
boundaries of data coming from CAPI packets.

### Impact

A local attacker could possibly escalate privileges or cause a Denial
of Service by sending a crafted CAPI packet.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All capi4k-utils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dialup/capi4k-utils-20050718-r3"
```

kernel security update (RHSA-2007-0672)

Original Release Date: November 2, 2007

Last Revised: May 8, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-404

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The Linux kernel manages the communication between software and
hardware as
well as the hardware resources of a computer running the Linux operating
system.

RedHat has issued an updated version of the kernel packages. Below is
a
list of the security issues fixed in the update as reported by
RedHat:

* a flaw in IPv6 flow label handling that allowed a local user to
  cause a
  denial of service (crash).
* a flaw in the ISDN CAPI subsystem that allowed a remote user to
  cause a
  denial of service or potential privilege escalation.
* a flaw in the Bluetooth subsystem that allowed a local user to
  trigger an
  information leak.
* various flaws in the supported filesystems that allowed a local
  privileged user to cause a denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the names
[CVE-2007-1592](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1592),
[CVE-2007-1217](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1217),
[CVE-2007-1353](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1353),
[CVE-2006-6054](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6054) and
[CVE-2006-6058](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6058) to these issues.

While this advisory deals with the kernel package from RedHat
Enterprise
Linux 2.1, the vulnerabilities in this advisory have been assessed
against
currently supported versions of Avaya products. As such, some of the
responses
may include versions of Avaya products that do not run on RedHat
Enterprise
Linux 2.1.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0672.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with affected kernel packages installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 3.0 | Low | Upgrade to CM 3.1 or later. |
| Avaya EMMC | EMMC 1.0.17 | Low | Upgrade to EMMC 1.0.21 |
| Avaya CCS/SES | CCS/SES 3.1 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to CCS/SES 3.1.1 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable
versions of kernel, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as the upgrade can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is
installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied
by RedHat Linux.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
