  "CVE-2007-1217": {
    "description": "The capi_cmsg2str function in the ISDN CAPI subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.21-rc2, and the bufprint routine in libcapi20-3, allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) and possibly gain privileges via a crafted CAPI packet, which is not properly handled when logging messages.",

        "root_cause": "The `capi_cmsg2str` and `capi_message2str` functions, used for debugging CAPI applications, were not thread-safe and contained a buffer overflow vulnerability. The `bufprint` routine used by these functions performs an unbounded `vsprintf` into a fixed-size 8KB buffer.",
