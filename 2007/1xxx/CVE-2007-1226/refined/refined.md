Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1226:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions on a configuration file used by McAfee VirusScan for Mac (Virex) to define files that should be excluded from scanning. This file, `VShieldExecute.txt`, located at `/Library/Application Support/Virex/`, is created with `rw-rw-rw` permissions, which allows any user to modify or delete it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Insecure file permissions:** The `VShieldExecute.txt` configuration file has world-writable permissions, enabling any user to modify its contents.
- **Lack of symlink check:** The `VShieldCheck` process doesn't check for symlinks before creating the `VShieldExecute.txt` file which leads to the possibility of an attacker creating a symlink to a different file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Local root privilege escalation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain root privileges on the affected system. Specifically, an attacker can create a symlink to `/var/cron/tabs/root`, causing the system to create and make it writable by the `VShieldCheck` process. Subsequently, the attacker can then insert malicious commands in this crontab which will execute at root level.
- **Scan bypass:**  An attacker can modify the `VShieldExecute.txt` file to exclude all files from scanning, effectively disabling the antivirus protection.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local access:** The attacker must have local access to the affected system.
- **File system manipulation:** The attack involves creating a symbolic link to `/var/cron/tabs/root` instead of the legitimate exclusion file to exploit the insecure permissions of the process that recreates the file at boot.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have a non-root user account on the target system with the ability to create files and symlinks in `/Library/Application Support/Virex/`.

**Additional details:**

- The advisory indicates that the vulnerability was patched on 2007-02-13 and that the vendor was very helpful throughout the process.
- A proof-of-concept Perl script is provided that demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by creating a symbolic link and setting up a cron job to obtain a root shell.
- The vulnerable versions are reported as McAfee VirusScan for Mac (Virex) versions <= 7.7.
