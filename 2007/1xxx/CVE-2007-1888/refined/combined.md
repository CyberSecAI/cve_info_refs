# USN-455-1: PHP vulnerabilities

27 April 2007

PHP vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Stefan Esser discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the "Month of PHP

bugs".

The substr\_compare() function did not sufficiently verify its length

argument. This might be exploited to read otherwise unaccessible

memory, which might lead to information disclosure. ([CVE-2007-1375](/security/CVE-2007-1375))

The shared memory (shmop) functions did not verify resource types,

thus they could be called with a wrong resource type that might

contain user supplied data. This could be exploited to read and write

arbitrary memory addresses of the PHP interpreter. This issue does

not affect Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-1376](/security/CVE-2007-1376))

The php\_binary handler of the session extension was missing a boundary

check. When unserializing overly long variable names this could be

exploited to read up to 126 bytes of memory, which might lead to

information disclosure. ([CVE-2007-1380](/security/CVE-2007-1380))

The internal array\_user\_key\_compare() function, as used for example by

the PHP function uksort(), incorrectly handled memory unreferencing of

its arguments. This could have been exploited to execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the PHP interpreter, and thus

circumventing any disable\_functions, open\_basedir, or safe\_mode

restrictions. ([CVE-2007-1484](/security/CVE-2007-1484))

The session\_regenerate\_id() function did not properly clean up the

former session identifier variable. This could be exploited to crash

the PHP interpreter, possibly also remotely. ([CVE-2007-1521](/security/CVE-2007-1521))

Under certain conditions the mb\_parse\_str() could cause the

register\_globals configuration option to become permanently enabled.

This opened an attack vector for a large and common class of

vulnerabilities. ([CVE-2007-1583](/security/CVE-2007-1583))

The session extension did not set the correct reference count value

for the session variables. By unsetting \_SESSION and HTTP\_SESSION\_VARS

(or tricking a PHP script into doing that) this could be exploited to

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP interpreter. This

issue does not affect Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-1700](/security/CVE-2007-1700))

The mail() function did not correctly escape control characters in

multiline email headers. This could be remotely exploited to inject

arbitrary email headers. ([CVE-2007-1718](/security/CVE-2007-1718))

The php\_stream\_filter\_create() function had an off-by-one buffer

overflow in the handling of wildcards. This could be exploited to

remotely crash the PHP interpreter. This issue does not affect Ubuntu

7.04. ([CVE-2007-1824](/security/CVE-2007-1824))

When calling the sqlite\_udf\_decode\_binary() with special arguments, a

buffer overflow happened. Depending on the application this could be

locally or remotely exploited to execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the PHP interpreter. ([CVE-2007-1887](/security/CVE-2007-1887) [CVE-2007-1888](/security/CVE-2007-1888))

The FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL filter extension used a wrong

regular expression that allowed injecting a newline character at the

end of the email string. This could be exploited to inject

arbitrary email headers. This issue only affects Ubuntu 7.04.

([CVE-2007-1900](/security/CVE-2007-1900))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* php5-cli
  -
  5.2.1-0ubuntu1.1
* php5-cgi
  -
  5.2.1-0ubuntu1.1
* libapache2-mod-php5
  -
  5.2.1-0ubuntu1.1
* php5-sqlite
  -
  5.2.1-0ubuntu1.1

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* php5-cli
  -
  5.1.6-1ubuntu2.4
* php5-cgi
  -
  5.1.6-1ubuntu2.4
* libapache2-mod-php5
  -
  5.1.6-1ubuntu2.4
* php5-sqlite
  -
  5.1.6-1ubuntu2.4

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* php5-cli
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.7
* php5-cgi
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.7
* libapache2-mod-php5
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.7
* php5-sqlite
  -
  5.1.2-1ubuntu3.7

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# [VIM] vendor ack/clarification for CVE-2007-1888 (SQLite)

key points: only version 2 is affected, which is an older version that
isn't used very much, except by PHP; and the relevant function was not
intended to handle attacker-controlled inputs.

Subject: CVE-2007-1888

Gentle People,

I am the original author and the principal architect of
the SQLite embedded database engine referenced in CVS-2007-1888.
I have not been contacted about this alleged vulnerability.
I discovered it while doing a Google search.

I have investigated the bug and have the following findings:

  *  The alleged bug occurs in the source file "encode.c".
     That file was removed from the SQLite source tree in
     September of 2004.  That file and the operations it
     encodes are no longer a part of SQLite.  Legacy versions
     of SQLite that make use of this old file are still
     available, but the use of those legacy versions is
     discouraged.  As far as we are aware, PHP is the
     only software still using this archaic version of
     SQLite.

  *  The vulnerability in question is arguably a case of
     PHP misusing the sqlite_decode_binary() API.  While it
     is true that sqlite_decode_binary() might be made more
     robust in the face of malformed inputs, sqlite_decode_binary()
     was never intended to be used in that context.

This bug applies to SQLite version 2 only, and then only
to very specific and narrow uses of SQLite version 2.  There
are countless users of SQLite in the wild, but apart from
PHP, they are almost all SQLite 3 users.  This bug has
zero impact on the overwhelming majority of SQLite users.

In order to avoid unnecessarily alarming the many users of
SQLite version 3, in any official announcement of this
vulnerability, you should make it clear that the vulnerability
only applies to SQLite version 2 and then only to users who
make use of the sqlite_decode_binary() function with an unchecked
input.

Thanks.

```
