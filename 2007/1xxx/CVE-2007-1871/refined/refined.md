Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the login form of the chcounter 3.1.3 PHP script. Specifically, the `login_name` field within the login form is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. Malicious HTML or JavaScript code can be injected through the login form's `login_name` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Cookie Stealing:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to steal session cookies from users.
- **Malicious Code Injection:**  The attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites, defacing the page, or performing other client-side attacks.
- **Information Disclosure:** Through injected scripts, sensitive information could be extracted from the user's browser or the page content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious POST request targeting the login form of chcounter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim or the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of target URL:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable chcounter instance.
- **Ability to craft malicious POST request:** The attacker must be able to create an HTTP POST request that includes the malicious code in the login_name field.

**Technical Details:**
The provided sample code demonstrates how to inject the payload:
```html
<form method=post action=http://chcounterinstallation/stats/>
<input type=hidden name=login_name value='"><script>alert(1)</script>'>
<input type=submit>
</form>
```
