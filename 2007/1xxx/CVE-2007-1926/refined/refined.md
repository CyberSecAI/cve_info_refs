{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The DirectAdmin log viewer does not properly sanitize log data before displaying it, leading to a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper neutralization of input during web page generation (CWE-79)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the system logs. When an administrator views these logs through the DirectAdmin log viewer, the attacker's script executes within the administrator's browser session. This can lead to session hijacking, allowing the attacker to gain administrative privileges and execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Injecting XSS payloads into various log files via network protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and SSH.",
      "Exploiting DirectAdmin's interface by including malicious code within domain names or other parameters in HTTP requests."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker can be an unauthenticated remote user or a valid DirectAdmin user, depending on the log file targeted. For some log files, an attacker can inject the XSS code without any prior authentication or access.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability affects DirectAdmin versions prior to 1.29.3.",
      "The fix involved encoding all characters when viewing logs through the log viewer.",
        "Multiple attack examples are provided demonstrating how to inject XSS payloads via various methods."
