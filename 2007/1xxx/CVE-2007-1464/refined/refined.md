Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1464:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of format string specifiers within Inkscape's dialog boxes and its Jabber whiteboard protocol. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize input strings used in these contexts, allowing format string specifiers to be interpreted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Format String Vulnerability:**  The primary weakness is the presence of format string vulnerabilities. This occurs when user-controlled data is used as the format string argument in functions like `printf` or `sprintf`. If an attacker can inject format string specifiers (like %s, %x, %n, etc.) they can read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Inkscape. This means an attacker can potentially take full control of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted URI:** The vulnerability can be exploited by enticing a user to open a specially crafted URI. This suggests that the vulnerable code path is triggered when Inkscape parses or handles URI schemes or data within a URI.
- **Jabber Whiteboard Protocol:** A format string error also exists in the Jabber whiteboard protocol which is likely related to network communication or sharing of data via Jabber.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction; the victim needs to open a malicious URI or interact with a malicious Jabber whiteboard.
- **Remote:** The attack can be launched remotely, suggesting that an attacker doesn't need physical access to the victim's machine.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text links CVE-2007-1464 with a GLSA (Gentoo Linux Security Advisory) which indicates this vulnerability was specific to Gentoo Linux systems, and is fixed in inkscape version 0.45.1.
- The gentoo bug report included shows a different sandbox issue that was resolved separately.
