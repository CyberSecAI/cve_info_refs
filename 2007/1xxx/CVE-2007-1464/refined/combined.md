| [Description](#c0)  Geert Bevin    2002-01-04 18:14:07 UTC  ``` /etc/gnome dir is created outside of image dir. Too tired to continue to look for the cause. Will do so asap. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-12 10:45:41 UTC  ``` Works fine here.  Was it a fresh installation ? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-12 15:53:20 UTC  ``` gnome-font-install, a util that comes with gnome-print, has '/etc/gnome' hardcoded.  Fixing it will break general use (will have '${D}/etc/gnome') hardcoded.  I will see if there is an easy solution. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-13 23:54:13 UTC  ``` I noticed that too, first time I tried it violated sandbox, but after merging without the sandbox once it didn't violate the sandbox when running with it again. I guess there is some file being written first time and then it just checks that it's there.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-17 19:03:36 UTC  ``` If /etc/gnome is not around it will try to create it and generate the sandbox violation. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-20 03:44:51 UTC  ``` Removed the running of gnome-font-install from the 'make install' process, and added it to pkg_postinst(). ``` |  |

# Inkscape: Two format string vulnerabilities — GLSA **200704-10**

Two format string vulnerabilities have been discovered in Inkscape,
allowing for user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/inkscape** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.45.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.45.1** |

### Background

Inkscape is a vector graphics editor, using Scalable Vector Graphics
(SVG) Format.

### Description

Kees Cook has discovered two vulnerabilities in Inkscape. The
application does not properly handle format string specifiers in some
dialog boxes. Inkscape is also vulnerable to another format string
error in its Jabber whiteboard protocol.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted URI,
possibly leading to execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running Inkscape.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Inkscape users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/inkscape-0.45.1"
```
