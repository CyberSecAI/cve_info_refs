Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1790:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `install_root` parameter within various PHP files of the Kaqoo Auction application. The application directly includes a file path provided in the `install_root` GET parameter, without validating or sanitizing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):**  The primary weakness is the ability to include remote files, meaning an attacker can provide a URL to a malicious PHP file hosted on an external server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for arbitrary file inclusion through the `install_root` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable Kaqoo Auction application.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation could lead to full control over the affected web server and potentially the entire system.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker could steal or alter sensitive data, inject malicious code into the application, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker could disrupt the application's availability by crashing it or overloading the server resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTTP GET requests where the `install_root` parameter is used to point to an attacker-controlled URL.
- **Direct access:** The attacker directly calls the vulnerable files via HTTP GET request and provides the malicious URL via the `install_root` parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Malicious PHP File Hosting:** The attacker needs a web server where they can host the malicious PHP file.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Files:** The attacker must know which files in the application are vulnerable to RFI via the `install_root` parameter.

**Additional Information:**

- The exploit database entry lists multiple PHP files vulnerable to this issue, including files in the `/include/core/`, `/include/display/`, and `/include/design/` directories.
- The exploit examples all use the format: `http://www.SitE.com/path/to/file.inc.php?install_root=[Shell]` where `[Shell]` is the URL of a remote PHP file that the attacker wants to include.

This vulnerability could be easily exploited and has a high severity, as it can result in full system compromise.
