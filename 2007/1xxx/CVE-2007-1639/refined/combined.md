# PHProjekt: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200706-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHProjekt, allowing for
the execution of arbitrary PHP and SQL code, and cross-site scripting
attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/phprojekt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.2.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.2.1** |

### Background

PHProjekt is a project management and coordination tool written in PHP.

### Description

Alexios Fakos from n.runs AG has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in
PHProjekt, including the execution of arbitrary SQL commands using
unknown vectors (CVE-2007-1575), the execution of arbitrary PHP code
using an unrestricted file upload (CVE-2007-1639), cross-site request
forgeries using different modules (CVE-2007-1638), and a cross-site
scripting attack using unkown vectors (CVE-2007-1576).

### Impact

An authenticated user could elevate their privileges by exploiting the
vulnerabilities described above. Note that the magic\_quotes\_gpc PHP
configuration setting must be set to "off" to exploit these
vulnerabilities.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PHProjekt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/phprojekt-5.2.1"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-03-14 17:02:33 UTC  ``` Some vulnerabilities have been reported in PHProjekt, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct cross-site scripting, script insertion, cross-site request forgery, and SQL injection attacks and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.  1) Input passed to unspecified parameters is not properly sanitised before being returned to a user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.  2) Input passed to unspecified parameters in the calendar module is not properly sanitised before being used in an SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.  3) Input passed to unspecified parameters in the search module is not properly sanitised before being used in an SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.  4) Input passed to an unspecified cookie is not properly sanitised before being used in an SQL query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code when the user logs out.  5) An error within the CSRF prevention routine can be exploited to conduct CSRF attacks.  6) Users can upload files through e.g. the calendar or file management modules. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a malicious PHP file.  7) Input passed to unspecified parameters is not properly verified before being used. This can be exploited to insert HTML and script code, which will executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site if malicious data is viewed.  Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities reportedly requires that a valid user is logged in.  The vulnerabilities are reported in version 5.2. Other versions may also be affected. Solution: upgrade to 5.2.1 ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-03-25 06:48:44 UTC  ``` web-apps please advise and bump as necessary. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-02 15:46:01 UTC  ``` ping web-apps ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-23 19:30:16 UTC  ``` web-apps, please advise. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Matthias Geerdsen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-24 16:09:10 UTC  ``` been over a month without a reaction on this one  web-apps, please provide an updated ebuild, otherwise I propose to mask this in about a week maybe ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-10 13:28:50 UTC  ``` any news here? ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Gunnar Wrobel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-10 13:44:05 UTC  ``` I started going through the open security bugs. No real excuse for the long delay except an extreme lack of manpower in webapps at the moment. Working through the bugs following severity. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Renat Lumpau (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-28 01:03:34 UTC  ``` 5.2.2 in CVS, please wait for the mirrors to pick up the tarball ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-28 06:24:25 UTC  ``` Thx Renat.  Arches please test and mark stable. Target keywords are:  phprojekt-5.2.2.ebuild:KEYWORDS="ppc x86" ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-31 10:16:11 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  nixnut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-02 20:28:33 UTC  ``` Stable on ppc.  ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-02 21:13:47 UTC  ``` ready for GLSA decision. I vote NO. ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-03 06:17:36 UTC  ``` SQL injection is not nice. Voting YES. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-07 21:19:06 UTC  ``` i vote yes due to the SQL injection issue and PHP execution of code, which make this bug a B2 (or C2 because of the need of a valid account), then [glsa]. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-19 22:18:33 UTC  ```  GLSA 200706-07, sorry for the delay ``` |  |
