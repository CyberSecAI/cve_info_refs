{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the 'postid' parameter in the PopnupBlog module.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or complete compromise of the database.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file of the PopnupBlog module by manipulating the 'postid' parameter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. The exploit requires a blind SQL injection technique which can be automated.",
    "additional_details": "The provided exploit code demonstrates how an attacker can extract the password hash of the administrator account using a blind SQL injection technique. The exploit iterates through possible characters of the password hash by sending a series of crafted HTTP requests. The server response is analyzed to determine whether the guessed character is correct. This approach allows an attacker to extract the entire password hash without getting a direct response from the database with the extracted data."
