Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input within the WordPress core, specifically when generating URLs for nonce confirmation actions.  The `wp_get_referer()` function was not being escaped, and the `add_query_arg()` output was also not escaped when generating URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability identified in the provided content is reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of escaping of user-supplied data in the `wp_get_referer()` function and the output of `add_query_arg()` could allow an attacker to inject malicious script.
2.  **Lack of Output Escaping:** The code failed to properly escape the URL parameters when building the confirmation links, leading to the vulnerability. Specifically the referer URL was not sanitized before being used to construct the admin url in the nonce confirmation page.
3. **Missing Sanitization:**  The vulnerable code was not sanitizing or validating user inputs prior to using them in the creation of HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS Attacks:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters. This script could then be executed in the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, hijack accounts, redirect the user to a malicious website or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly stated, an XSS vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities (like CSRF) to escalate privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Referer Header Manipulation:** An attacker could craft a malicious link or page that manipulates the referer header of the request sent to the vulnerable WordPress site. This crafted referer would then be included in the confirmation page, allowing for XSS.
*  **Crafted URLs:** Attackers could craft malicious URLs using `add_query_arg()` by manipulating values used in the URL parameters for nonce confirmation actions which could lead to XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to get the victim to visit a specifically crafted link or a website that will generate the manipulated `referer` header or inject malicious query parameters.
*   No direct access to the WordPress server is required. The vulnerability is exploitable via a web browser.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided changeset shows the fix which consists of applying the `attribute_escape()` function to the `wp_get_referer()` output and the output of `add_query_arg()`, which is used to build the confirmation URL.
* The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200703-23) mentions multiple XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities in WordPress, and lists this CVE alongside others. This shows that this vulnerability was part of a wider security issue in the software.
*  The Secunia content is primarily focused on marketing their vulnerability research and management tools.  It does not contain specific vulnerability details for CVE-2007-1230 but suggests a general vulnerability.
*   The vupen.com content is unrelated and appears to be a placeholder page.

**Summary:**
CVE-2007-1230 is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability caused by a lack of proper escaping of user-supplied data used in generating confirmation URLs. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating the referer header or crafting a malicious URL to inject malicious JavaScript code. This allows them to perform various malicious actions within the context of the victim's browser.
