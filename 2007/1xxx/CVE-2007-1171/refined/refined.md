  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of the 'admin' cookie and the 'tid' parameter in the 'nsbypass.php' file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Blind SQL Injection (CWE-89)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker injects SQL code via a crafted 'admin' cookie which is base64 encoded and a 'tid' GET parameter."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and be able to set cookies. The attacker also needs to know a valid username. The NukeSentinel module must be activated and its track_active option must be enabled."
