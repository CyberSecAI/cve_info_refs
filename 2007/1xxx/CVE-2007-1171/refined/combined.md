### [Baby Formula: HiPP Brand History](baby-formula-hipp-brand-history.html)

The history of the Hipp brand dates back to 1898, when Josef the hippy confectioner from Güntsburg had a daughter and then twins a year later. And all would be well, but Joseph's wife began to have problems with breast milk, the woman was clearly not able to feed all their children. So Josef decided to make the formula himself. He baked dry cookies, ground them up and prepared a special mixture based on cow's milk. To his delight, the children were satisfied with its taste. Even today, Hipp is one of the most famous baby food brands in the world. It sells a wide range of various products for the nutrition of children of different age categories.

### [Maybe He Just Likes You by Barbara Dee ~ #MeToo](2019/06/maybe-he-just-likes-you-by-barbara-dee.html)

Introducing a new title for middle
graders that I thought might be of interest to most of my readers

***Maybe He Just Likes You***by
Barbara Dee

Barbara Dee explores the subject of #MeToo for the middle grade
audience in this heart-wrenching—and ultimately uplifting—novel about
experiencing harassment and unwanted attention from classmates.

For seventh-grader Mila, it starts with some boys giving her an
unwanted hug on the school blacktop. A few days later, at recess, one of the
boys (and fellow trumpet player) Callum tells Mila it’s his birthday, and asks
her for a “birthday hug.” He’s just being friendly, isn’t he? And how can she
say no? But Callum’s hug lasts a few seconds too long, and feels…weird.
According to her friend, Zara, Mila is being immature and overreacting. Doesn’t
she know what flirting looks like?

But the boys don’t leave Mila alone. On the bus. In the halls.
During band practice—the one place Mila could always escape.

It doesn’t feel like flirting—so what is it? Thanks to a chance
meeting, Mila begins to find

### [Hailee by Penny Zeller ~ another amazing review](2019/05/hailee-by-penny-zeller-another-amazing.html)

**Hailee by Penny Zeller**

**Montanna Skies Series #3**

[![](https://www.nukescripts.net/3bp/-uFw2w2s-Tfg/UDvlHzeYylI/AAAAAAAAC3Y/8hIOkf-X4t0/s320/hailee+penny+zeller.jpg)](https://www.nukescripts.net/3bp/-uFw2w2s-Tfg/UDvlHzeYylI/AAAAAAAAC3Y/8hIOkf-X4t0/s1600/hailee%2Bpenny%2Bzeller.jpg)

At twenty years of age, Nathaniel Maxwell Adams Jr., better known as Nate, fulfills a prophecy he made eleven years prior by moving to Pine Haven. What he hadn't planned in his youth, though, was to become a pastor, especially since his parents adamantly oppose the idea. So, as he shepherds a flock in the growing Montana town, he feels called to another smaller yet no less significant mission field: his mother and father.

For years, orphan Hailee Annigan was just a ragamuffin, roaming the Cincinnati streets trying to keep food in the mouths of her two younger brothers and herself. This often meant thieving, which landed her in the Sanctuary of Hope, a home for delinquent youngsters. There, her life changed, thanks to her patient, loving teachers. Now, at eighteen, she pursues a dream to become a teacher herself and bravely accepts a position in Montana. She still has faith that she'll find her brothers again someday, but for now, she's ready to put the past behind her.

When their paths converge in Pine Haven, their lives begin to overlap in ways they can't ignore. And they must discover if God intends for their destinies to converge, as well.

**(spoilers ahead. . . . )**

I was  drawn to the main character Hailee from the beginning of the book.  Her story of love and sacrifice for her younger brothers endeared her to me right away.  I was captivated

**I found this post that I had put on my blog a few years ago.  Summer Break is coming fast and I have only a few outings planned for the kiddos.  I want to keep them busy, yet still give them time for carefree fun.**

**I am interested in ideas!  What do you do with your kiddos during breaks from school when you are not gone on vacation?  I do have some chores for them but also want some fun ideas that are low-cost to entertain them and also stimulate their minds.   Here is what happened in the previous post . . . . . .**

 * a server to add several cookies for the next requests) and the
 * allowredirection() function (which allow the script to follow all
 * redirections sent by the server). It can return the content (or the
 * headers) of the request. Others useful functions can be used for debugging.
 * A manual is actually in development but to know how to use it, you can
 * read the comments.
 *
 * CHANGELOG:
 * [2007-01-24] (1.2)
 *  * Bug #2 fixed: Problem concerning the getcookie() function ((|;))
 *  * New: multipart/form-data enctype is now supported
 *
 * [2006-12-31] (1.1)
 *  * Bug #1 fixed: Problem concerning the allowredirection() function (chr(13) bug)
 *  * New: You can now call the getheader() / getcontent() function without parameters
 *
 * [2006-12-30] (1.0)
 *  * First version

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
