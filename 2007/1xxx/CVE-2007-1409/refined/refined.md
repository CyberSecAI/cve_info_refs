Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1409:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from multiple flaws found in the WordPress application. Specifically, the "file" parameter in `wp-admin/templates.php` is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. The vulnerability is specifically located in the "file" parameter of the `wp-admin/templates.php` script.
-   **Information Leak:** The content also mentions that WordPress prints full PHP script paths in some error messages, revealing sensitive information that could be leveraged in further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **XSS:** Successful XSS exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal browser session data or cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
    - Execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser.
-   **Information Leak:** Disclosure of full PHP script paths could aid an attacker in planning and executing other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable, meaning an attacker can initiate an attack over a network connection.
-   **Web-Based Attack:** The attack involves crafting a malicious web page designed to exploit the vulnerabilities in WordPress. Users can be enticed to visit this page, triggering the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress installation.
-   **Social Engineering:** The attacker may need to employ social engineering techniques to lure a victim to a specially crafted web page.
-   **Knowledge of WordPress:** The attacker needs some knowledge of WordPress, particularly of the vulnerable parameter in the `templates.php` script, in order to craft a successful XSS attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200703-23) indicates that multiple other vulnerabilities were found alongside the one described in CVE-2007-1409, including other XSS and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) flaws. The advisory recommends that WordPress users unmerge the vulnerable package from their system.
- This advisory consolidates multiple vulnerabilities into a single security notice.
- Secunia advisory SA 24430 is related to this vulnerability and is a part of the multi-faceted advisory which is covered in GLSA 200703-23
