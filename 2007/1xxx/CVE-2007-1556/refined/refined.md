- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in `kommentare.php` of Creative Files 1.2.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `dlid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication, potentially retrieve sensitive data from the database, and potentially modify data. Specifically, the provided example shows how to extract usernames and password hashes from the `user` table.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a web request to `kommentare.php` with a manipulated `dlid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required for the injection point.
