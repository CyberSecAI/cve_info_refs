Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1108:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw present in the `index.php` file of CS-Gallery version 2.0 and earlier.

*   **Weakness:** The `index.php` script uses a POST parameter `album` to construct a file path, which is then included using the PHP `include` function, without proper sanitization.

    ```php
    $codefile=$_POST['album'].'/code.php';
    include $codefile;
    ```

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious PHP code, which will be executed on the server. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target server, leading to complete compromise of the web application and potentially the underlying system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is via HTTP POST requests to `index.php` with the `todo=securealbum` parameter set. The `album` POST parameter contains the URL of the malicious file.
    *   The exploit leverages the PHP `include` function and the lack of input sanitization.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   The attacker needs to host a malicious PHP file accessible via a URL.
    *   The target server needs to have `allow_url_fopen` and `allow_url_include` PHP settings enabled.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using PHP's `curl` functions. It sends a POST request to `index.php` with `todo=securealbum` and includes the URL of a remote shell script in the `album` parameter.
* The exploit code also has a proxy support option

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to CS-Gallery version 2.0 and earlier.
*   The exploit code verifies the presence of PHP's cURL extension and the target configuration (`allow_url_fopen` and `allow_url_include`).
*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a working exploit script, aiding penetration testers and researchers.
