{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `viewcat.php` script in the XOOPS Module Core is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the application's database. This allows them to bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data (such as usernames and passwords), and potentially modify or delete data in the database.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the `cid` parameter in the `/modules/core/viewcat.php` URL. By manipulating this parameter with crafted SQL code, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, meaning they must be able to interact with the web server and send crafted requests. No special privileges or prior authentication is necessary to exploit the SQL injection."
