Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2007-1202:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient data validation when Microsoft Word parses rich text properties within a file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper parsing of rich text format (RTF) properties leading to memory corruption.
- Lack of sufficient input validation when processing RTF data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who opens the malicious document.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, potentially installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability can be exploited by enticing a user to open a specially crafted Word file, delivered via:
    - E-mail attachment.
    - Malicious website hosting the file.
    - Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious Word file containing specially crafted RTF properties that trigger the vulnerability when parsed by Microsoft Word.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the file (e.g., through social engineering, tricking the user into opening a file they receive via email or visit a malicious website).
