{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the insecure use of the 'script_pfad' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file, which could contain malicious code, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'gb_pfad' parameter within the `functions_inc.php` file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious URL within the 'gb_pfad' parameter. The attacker needs to have access to a web server where they can host the malicious file."
