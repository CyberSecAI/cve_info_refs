ePortfolio version 1.0 Java Multiple Input Validation Vulnerabilities
scip AG Vulnerability ID 2893 (12/22/2006)
http://www.scip.ch/cgi-bin/smss/showadvf.pl?id=2893
I. INTRODUCTION
ePortfolio is a e-banking application by TKS Banking Solutions.
More information is available on the vendors web site at the following URL:
http://www.tksbankingsolutions.com/
II. DESCRIPTION
Stefan Friedli found several web-based vulnerabilities that were identified in ePortfolio version 1.0 Java and may affect earlier versions as well.
The application uses heavy amounts of javascript code for operation. As this is not generally a bad thing, it causes massive problems when it comes to data validation. As we recognized, the entire validation of input is realized by client-side javascript which can easily be bypassed using a Proxy BURPproxy or WebScarab to modify original requests sent (and validated) by the browser.
We assume this vulnerability to exist in nearly every form offered by the application. Due to the limited functionality of the account used for testing, we're not able to definitely confirm or deny this fact.
PoC Code is not being published.
IV. IMPACT
As there is a serious lack of server-side measured to protect the application from malicious input, an attacker may realize nearly every attack that relies on lacking input-validation which includes Cross Site Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery (Session Riding) .
V. DETECTION
Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or intrusion detection system. Patterns for detection of basic attacks are available and easy to implement, though they may possibly fail on more sophisticated attacks.
VI. SOLUTION
Server-side input validation should be provied by the application vendor as soon as possible.
VII. VENDOR RESPONSE
The problems were recognized and will, according to the vendor, be adressed with the next release by the end of this week. Further, the vendor claims to be able to change the faulty behaviour remotely or by editing a non-specified file for existing customers.
