        "root_cause": "The application relies solely on client-side JavaScript for input validation.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Lack of server-side input validation",
          "Reliance on client-side validation which can easily be bypassed"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can bypass client-side validation and inject malicious input, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Modifying HTTP requests using a proxy (e.g., BURPproxy or WebScarab)",
           "Bypassing client-side JavaScript validation by manipulating the request before it reaches the server"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests. This can be achieved with tools like a proxy server (e.g., BURPproxy or WebScarab). No special access or privileges are required on the target server."
