Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `path_to_news` parameter within `listing.php` and `visview.php` files of aWebNews version 1.5. This allows a remote attacker to include arbitrary PHP files from external sources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include and execute arbitrary PHP files from a remote location. This is due to the application not validating or sanitizing the `path_to_news` parameter.
*   **Code Injection:** By including a malicious PHP file, the attacker can inject arbitrary code into the application's execution context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This could lead to a complete compromise of the web application and potentially the server itself.
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** The attacker could gain access to sensitive information stored on the server.
*   **Integrity Impact:** The attacker could modify or delete data on the server.
*   **Availability Impact:** The attacker could cause a denial-of-service or otherwise disrupt the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests to `listing.php` or `visview.php`, injecting a URL pointing to a malicious PHP script within the `path_to_news` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker does not need to have local access to the server and can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication to the application.
*   **Medium Attack Complexity:** The attack is considered of medium complexity, likely requiring knowledge of the vulnerable files and how to craft the malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `listing.php` and `visview.php` files.
*   The malicious payload is provided through the `path_to_news` GET parameter.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes exploit examples:
    *   `http://www.SitE.*/[aWebNewsPaTh]/listing.php?path_to_news=[Shell]`
    *   `http://www.SitE.*/[aWebNewsPaTh]/visview.php?path_to_news=Shell]`
