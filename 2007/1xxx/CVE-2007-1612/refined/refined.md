  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'fraza' parameter when constructing SQL queries.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially bypass authentication, gain access to sensitive data, modify or delete data within the database. The provided exploit is designed to extract a specific 'identyfikator' from the 'opcje' table which could be a login credential.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the 'index.php' script with a malicious SQL payload injected into the 'fraza' parameter.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and the structure of the database to craft a malicious SQL query. No special privileges are required."
