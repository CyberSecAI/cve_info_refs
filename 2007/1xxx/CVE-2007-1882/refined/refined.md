Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The HP Mercury Quality Center (now known as HP ALM) has a command called `RunQuery` accessible to authenticated users, which allows execution of arbitrary SQL commands. This is not SQL injection, but rather a direct execution of any SQL statement provided by the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Unrestricted SQL Execution:** The `RunQuery` command allows any authenticated user to execute arbitrary SQL commands, bypassing any input sanitization or restriction mechanisms.
  - **Blind SQL Execution (initial analysis):** While the initial analysis indicates that the query execution is blind (no results directly returned), the author suggests that retrieving results might be possible with further effort.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - **Data Access and Manipulation:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to access sensitive information stored in the database (confidentiality impact), modify existing data (integrity impact), or potentially cause denial-of-service by disrupting database operations (availability impact). The provided example notes partial impact in these areas, suggesting that a complete compromise of each area may be possible.
   -  **Database Manipulation:**  An attacker could create, alter, or delete tables and other database objects.
   -  **Privilege Escalation:**  If the database user account associated with the application has elevated permissions, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges and gain control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network-based:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability over the network by connecting to the HP Mercury Quality Center server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to log in to the HP Mercury Quality Center application.
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the HP Mercury Quality Center server.

**Additional Notes:**
  - The provided information mentions a Perl script that demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability, further indicating the possibility for exploitation.
  - The vulnerability affects version 9.0 build 9.1.0.4352.
  - The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
  - The CVSS Base Score is 6.5/10.
