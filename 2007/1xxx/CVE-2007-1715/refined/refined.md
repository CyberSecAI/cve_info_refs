Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a remote file inclusion (RFI) weakness in the `AD_BODY_TEMP` parameter of the Free Image Hosting 2.0 application. This parameter, when passed to `include()` function in the PHP code allows an attacker to include a remote file.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject a URL into the `AD_BODY_TEMP` parameter, causing the server to include and execute the remote file. The code `<?php include($AD_BODY_TEMP);?>` is vulnerable because it directly includes the value of `$AD_BODY_TEMP` without proper sanitization.
    
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. By including a malicious PHP file hosted remotely, the attacker can gain full control of the server, compromise data, or perform other malicious activities.

* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts (`login.php`, `frontpage.php`, `forgot_pass.php`). The `AD_BODY_TEMP` parameter in the query string is used to specify the malicious URL.
  
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They also need to host a malicious PHP file that they can include remotely.

**Additional Details:**
* The exploit examples provided show how to include a shell using the `AD_BODY_TEMP` parameter, for example:
    `www.site.com/imageupload_path/login.php?AD_BODY_TEMP=Shell?`
* The vulnerable code snippet `<td><div align="center"><?php include($AD_BODY_TEMP);?></div></td>` is mentioned, highlighting the exact location of the vulnerability within the application's PHP code.
