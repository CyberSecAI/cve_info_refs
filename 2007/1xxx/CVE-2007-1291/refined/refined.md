```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Tyger Bug Tracking System is vulnerable to both SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection: Improperly sanitized user input in ViewBugs.php allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Insufficient input validation in Login.php and Register.php enables an attacker to inject malicious scripts."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database via SQL injection, and execute malicious scripts in a user's browser via XSS.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "SQL Injection: Sending a crafted 's' parameter in the URL for ViewBugs.php.",
    "Cross-Site Scripting: Injecting malicious code into the URL of Login.php and Register.php."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. They do not need local access to the server."
