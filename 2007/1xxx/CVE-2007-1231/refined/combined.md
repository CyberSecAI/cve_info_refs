SQLiteManager v1.2.0 Multiple Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------------------------
vendor : http://www.sqlitemanager.org/
Global risk : High
-------------------------------------------------------
SQLite is a SQL managed portal like PhpMyAdmin.
Multiple Cross Scripting Vulnerabilities
-----------------------------------------
In main.php the database name field is vulnerable to a XSS attack.
This xss is permanent, if a user with restricted rights creates a
table with as name a malicious code the administrator gone get his
cookie stealed when he opens SqliteManager's index. The same things
happens for the table's name field if a malicious code is inserted.
The solution is then to use htmlentities().
others vulnerables fields to XSS attacks :
main.php :
............... ViewName
............... view
............... trigger
............... function
............... (...)
Theses vulnerabilities are presents in others pages too.
Here too the better solution is to use htmlentities().
reference : www.php.net/htmlentities
Locale File Include
-------------------
GET /home/sqlite/ HTTP/1.0
[...]
Cookie: PHPSESSID=[...];SQLiteManager\_currentTheme=../../../../../../../../../..
/../../../etc/passwd%00;
SQLiteManager\_currentLangue=deleted
SQLiteManager\_currentTheme variable is vulnerable.
This request will returns the /etc/passwd file.
This vulnerability is dangerous, indeed a user with restricted access to SqliteManage
could get non-authorized files.
