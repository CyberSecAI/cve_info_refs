MADYNES Security Advisory

 <<http://madynes.loria.fr/>> <http://madynes.loria.fr>

Title: Asterisk SIP INVITE remote DOS

Release Date:

      08/03/2007

Severity:

      High - Denial of Service

Advisory ID:KIPH1

Software:

      Asterisk

       <<http://www.asterisk.org/>> <http://www.asterisk.org/>

AsteriskR is a complete IP PBX in software. It runs on a wide variety of
operating systems including Linux, Mac OS X, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Sun
Solaris and provides all of the features you would expect from a PBX
including many advanced features that are often associated with high end
(and high cost) proprietary PBXs. AsteriskR supports Voice over IP in many
protocols, and can interoperate with almost all standards-based telephony
equipment using relatively inexpensive hardware.

Affected Versions:

      Asterisk 1.2.14, 1.2.15, 1.2.16

      Asterisk 1.4.1

      probably previous versions also

Unaffected Versions: Trunk version to date (13/03/2007)

Vulnerability Synopsis: After sending a crafted INVITE message the software
finish abruptly its execution with a Segmentation Fault provoking a Denial
of Service (DoS) in all the services provided by the entity.

Impact: A remote individual can remotely crash and perform a Denial of
Service(DoS) attack in all the services provided by the software by sending
one crafted SIP INVITE message. This is conceptually similar to the "ping of
death".

Resolution: The problem has been fixed in Asterisk versions 1.4.2 and
1.2.17, which is released today 19/03/2007

Vulnerability Description: After sending a crafted message the software
crash abruptly. The message in this case is an anonymous INVITE where the
SDP contains 2 connection headers. The first one must be valid and the
second not where the IP address should be invalid. The callee needs not to
be a valid user or dialplan. In case where asterisk is set to disallow
anonymous call, a valid user and password should be known, and while
responding the corresponding INVITE challenge the information should be
crafted as above. After this crafted SIP INVITE message, the affected
software crash immediately.

Proof of Concept Code: available

Credits:

      Humberto J. Abdelnur (Ph.D Student)

      Radu State (Ph.D)

      Olivier Festor (Ph.D)

      This vulnerability was identified by the Madynes research team at
INRIA

      Lorraine, using the Madynes VoIP fuzzer.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Asterisk: Two SIP Denial of Service vulnerabilities — GLSA **200704-01**

Asterisk is vulnerable to two Denial of Service issues in the SIP channel.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/asterisk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.14-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.14-r2**revision >= **1.0.12-r2** |

### Background

Asterisk is an open source implementation of a telephone private branch
exchange (PBX).

### Description

The Madynes research team at INRIA has discovered that Asterisk
contains a null pointer dereferencing error in the SIP channel when
handling INVITE messages. Furthermore qwerty1979 discovered that
Asterisk 1.2.x fails to properly handle SIP responses with return code
0.

### Impact

A remote attacker could cause an Asterisk server listening for SIP
messages to crash by sending a specially crafted SIP message or
answering with a 0 return code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Asterisk users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose net-misc/asterisk
```

Note: Asterisk 1.0.x is no longer supported upstream so users should
consider upgrading to Asterisk 1.2.x.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Geert Bevin    2002-01-04 18:14:07 UTC  ``` /etc/gnome dir is created outside of image dir. Too tired to continue to look for the cause. Will do so asap. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-12 10:45:41 UTC  ``` Works fine here.  Was it a fresh installation ? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-12 15:53:20 UTC  ``` gnome-font-install, a util that comes with gnome-print, has '/etc/gnome' hardcoded.  Fixing it will break general use (will have '${D}/etc/gnome') hardcoded.  I will see if there is an easy solution. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-13 23:54:13 UTC  ``` I noticed that too, first time I tried it violated sandbox, but after merging without the sandbox once it didn't violate the sandbox when running with it again. I guess there is some file being written first time and then it just checks that it's there.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-17 19:03:36 UTC  ``` If /etc/gnome is not around it will try to create it and generate the sandbox violation. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-20 03:44:51 UTC  ``` Removed the running of gnome-font-install from the 'make install' process, and added it to pkg_postinst(). ``` |  |
