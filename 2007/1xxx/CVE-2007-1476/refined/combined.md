Hello,

We would like to inform you about a vulnerability in Symantec Norton products.

Description:

Norton insufficiently protects its driver \Device\SymEvent against a manipulation by \
malicious applications and it fails  to validate its input buffer. It is possible to \
open this driver and send arbitrary data to it, which are implicitly  believed to be \
valid. It is possible to assemble the data in the input buffer such that the driver \
performs an invalid  memory operation and crashes the whole operating system. Further \
impacts of this bug (like possibility of arbitrary code  execution in the kernel \
mode) were not examined.

Vulnerable software:

     * Norton Personal Firewall 2006 version 9.1.1.7
     * Norton Personal Firewall 2006 version 9.1.0.33
     * probably all versions of Norton Personal Firewall 2006, Norton Internet \
Security 2006 and other products that use  SymTDI driver
     * possibly older versions of Norton Personal Firewall and Norton Internet \
Security

More details and a proof of concept including its source code are available here:
