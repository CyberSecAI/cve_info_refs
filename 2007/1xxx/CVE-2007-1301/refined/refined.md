  "cve": "CVE-2007-1301",
  "description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in MailEnable Professional/Enterprise versions 2.32 to 2.37 when handling the APPEND command. By sending a specially crafted APPEND command with a large amount of data, a remote attacker can potentially overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper bounds checking when processing the APPEND command, allowing a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Insufficient bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target server with the privileges of the MailEnable service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through sending a crafted 'APPEND' command to the IMAP service. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the way the server handles the data associated with the 'APPEND' command, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the IMAP service (port 143 by default) and valid user credentials to authenticate to the server before sending the crafted APPEND command."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The provided exploit code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability and gain remote code execution. The exploit specifically targets Mail Enable Professional versions 2.32, 2.33, 2.35 and 2.37 and uses a hardcoded shellcode that binds a shell to port 1337. It also provides different return address offsets for different versions and OS, and uses a NOP slide in the payload."
