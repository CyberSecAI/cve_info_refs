Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-1907:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `warn.php` file of Pathos CMS versions 0.92-2. The script uses `include_once($_GET['file'] . ".html");`, which directly includes a file specified in the `file` GET parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is an RFI. The script doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input provided through the `$_GET['file']` parameter before including the file. This allows an attacker to include a malicious file from a remote server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file (e.g., a web shell), the attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:**  Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the vulnerable web server, allowing attackers to steal data, deface the website, or use the compromised server as part of a botnet.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request targeting the `warn.php` file.
*   **`file` Parameter:** The `file` parameter in the URL is used to specify the remote file to be included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know that the `warn.php` script is vulnerable to RFI.
*   **Hosting Malicious File:** The attacker needs to have a malicious PHP file accessible over the network (e.g., on a server under their control).

**Technical Details:**
The code snippet from `warn.php`:
```php
include_once($_GET['file'] . ".html");
```
This line is the source of the vulnerability. It takes the value from the GET parameter `file`, appends `.html` to it, and attempts to include the resulting path as a PHP file.

**Example exploit:**
The exploit example from the content is:
```
http://SITE.com/path/warn.php?file=[SHELL]
```
Where `[SHELL]` would be the URL of the attacker's malicious PHP file.
