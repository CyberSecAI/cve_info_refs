# PHP 4.4.7 Release Announcement

The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate availability of
PHP 4.4.7. This release continues to improve the security and the stability of
the 4.4 branch and all users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to it as soon
as possible.

**Security Enhancements and Fixes in PHP 4.4.7:**

* Fixed CVE-2007-1001, GD wbmp used with invalid image size (by Ivan Fratric)
* Fixed asciiz byte truncation inside mail() (MOPB-33 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed a bug in mb\_parse\_str() that can be used to activate register\_globals (MOPB-26 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed unallocated memory access/double free in in array\_user\_key\_compare() (MOPB-24 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed a double free inside session\_regenerate\_id() (MOPB-22 by Stefan Esser)
* Added missing open\_basedir & safe\_mode checks to zip:// and bzip:// wrappers. (MOPB-21 by Stefan Esser).
* Limit nesting level of input variables with max\_input\_nesting\_level as fix for (MOPB-03 by Stefan Esser)
* XSS in phpinfo() (MOPB-8 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed CRLF injection inside ftp\_putcmd(). (by loveshell[at]Bug.Center.Team)
* Fixed a possible super-global overwrite inside import\_request\_variables(). (by Stefano Di Paola, Stefan Esser)
* Fixed a remotely trigger-able buffer overflow inside bundled libxmlrpc library. (by Stanislav Malyshev)

While majority of the issues outlined above are local, few issues such as the
XML-RPC overflows can be triggered remotely and therefor should be considered
critical. If you use the XML-RPC extension consider upgrading as soon as
possible.

**Other improvements of PHP 4.4.7 include:**

* About 10 bug fixes.

For a full list of changes in PHP 4.4.7, see the [ChangeLog](/ChangeLog-4.php#4.4.7).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# PHP 5.2.2 Release Announcement

The PHP development team would like to announce the immediate availability of PHP 5.2.2.
This release continues to improve the security and the stability of the 5.X
branch and all users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to it as soon as possible.

**Security Enhancements and Fixes in PHP 5.2.2:**

* Fixed CVE-2007-1001, GD wbmp used with invalid image size (by Ivan Fratric)
* Fixed a header injection via Subject and To parameters to the mail() function (MOPB-34 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed asciiz byte truncation inside mail() (MOPB-33 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed wrong length calculation in unserialize S type (MOPB-29 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed a bug in mb\_parse\_str() that can be used to activate register\_globals (MOPB-26 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed unallocated memory access/double free in in array\_user\_key\_compare() (MOPB-24 by Stefan Esser)
* Fixed a double free inside session\_regenerate\_id() (MOPB-22 by Stefan Esser)
* Added missing open\_basedir & safe\_mode checks to zip:// and bzip:// wrappers. (MOPB-20, MOPB-21 by Stefan Esser).
* Fixed substr\_compare and substr\_count information leak (MOPB-14 by Stefan Esser) (Stas, Ilia)
* Limit nesting level of input variables with max\_input\_nesting\_level as fix for (MOPB-03 by Stefan Esser)

* Fixed a buffer overflow inside user\_filter\_factory\_create(). (by Ilia Alshanetsky)
* Fixed a remotely trigger-able buffer overflow inside bundled libxmlrpc library. (by Stanislav Malyshev)

While majority of the issues outlined above are local, in some circumstances given specific code paths they can be
triggered externally. Therefor, we strongly recommend that if you use code utilizing the functions and extensions identified as
having had vulnerabilities in them, you consider upgrading your PHP.

**The key improvements of PHP 5.2.2 include:**

* Further improvements to the Memory Manager with the goal of improving realloc() performance.
* Bundled GD, SQLite and PCRE libraries were upgraded.
* Additional methods were added to SPL's DirectoryIterator and SplFileInfo classes.
* Over 120 bug fixes.

For users upgrading from PHP 5.0 and PHP 5.1, an upgrade guide is available
[here](/UPDATE_5_2.txt), detailing the changes between those releases
and PHP 5.2.2.
