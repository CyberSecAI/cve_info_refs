[↑ Back to top](#wp--skip-link--target)

WordPress uses a concept of [Roles](#roles), designed to give the [site](/support/article/glossary/#site) owner the ability to control what users can and cannot do within the site. A site owner can manage the user access to such tasks as [writing and editing posts](/support/article/writing-posts/), [creating Pages](/support/article/pages/), [creating categories](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Categories_SubPanel), [moderating comments](https://codex.wordpress.org/Comment_Moderation), [managing plugins](/support/article/managing-plugins/), [managing themes](/support/article/using-themes/), and [managing other users](https://codex.wordpress.org/Users_Screen), by assigning a specific role to each of the users.

WordPress has six pre-defined roles: [Super Admin](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#super-admin), [Administrator](#administrator), [Editor](#editor), [Author](#author), [Contributor](#contributor) and [Subscriber](#subscriber). Each role is allowed to perform a set of tasks called [Capabilities](/support/article/glossary/#capabilities). There are many capabilities including “[publish\_posts](#publish_posts)“, “[moderate\_comments](#moderate_comments)“, and “[edit\_users](#edit_users)“. [A default set](#capability-vs-role-table) of capabilities is pre-assigned to each role, but other capabilities can be assigned or removed using the [add\_cap()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_cap) and [remove\_cap()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_cap) functions. New roles can be introduced or removed using the [add\_role()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_role) and [remove\_role()](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_role) functions.

The [Super Admin](#super-admin) role allows a user to perform all possible capabilities. Each of the other roles has a decreasing number of allowed capabilities. For instance, the [Subscriber](#subscriber) role has just the “[read](#read)” capability. One particular role should not be considered to be senior to another role. Rather, consider that roles define the user’s responsibilities within the site.

## [Summary of Roles](#summary-of-roles)

* [Super Admin](#super-admin) – somebody with access to the site network administration features and all other features. See the [Create a Network](/support/article/create-a-network/) article.
* [Administrator](#administrator) (*slug: ‘administrator’*) – somebody who has access to all the administration features within a single site.
* [Editor](#editor) (*slug: ‘editor’*) – somebody who can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users.
* [Author](#author)  (*slug: ‘author’*)  – somebody who can publish and manage their own posts.
* [Contributor](#contributor) (*slug: ‘contributor’*) – somebody who can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.
* [Subscriber](#subscriber) (*slug: ‘subscriber’*) – somebody who can only manage their profile.

Upon installing WordPress, an Administrator account is automatically created.

The default role for new users can be set in [Administration Screens](/support/article/administration-screens/) > [Settings](/support/article/administration-screens/#settings-configuration-settings) > [General](/support/article/settings-general-screen/).

## [Roles](#roles)

A Role defines a set of tasks a user assigned the role is allowed to perform. For instance, the [Super Admin](#super-admin) role encompasses every possible task that can be performed within a [Network](/support/article/glossary/#network) of virtual WordPress [sites](/support/article/glossary/#site). The [Administrator](#administrator) role limits the allowed tasks only to those which affect a single site. On the other hand, the [Author](#author) role allows the execution of just a small subset of tasks.

The following sections list the default Roles and their capabilities:

### [Super Admin](#super-admin)

Multisite Super Admins have, by default, all capabilities. The following Multisite-only capabilities are therefore only available to Super Admins:

* [create\_sites](#create_sites)
* [delete\_sites](#delete_sites)
* [manage\_network](#manage_network)
* [manage\_sites](#manage_sites)
* [manage\_network\_users](#manage_network_users)
* [manage\_network\_plugins](#manage_network_plugins)
* [manage\_network\_themes](#manage_network_themes)
* [manage\_network\_options](#manage_network_options)
* [upgrade\_network](#upgrade_network)
* [setup\_network](#setup_network)

In the case of single site WordPress installation, Administrators are, in effect, Super Admins. As such, they are the only ones to have access to [additional admin capabilities](/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#additional-admin-capabilities).

### [Administrator](#administrator)

The capabilities of Administrators differs between single site and [Multisite](/support/article/glossary/#multisite) WordPress installations. All administrators have the following capabilities:

* [activate\_plugins](#activate_plugins)
* [delete\_others\_pages](#delete_others_pages)
* [delete\_others\_posts](#delete_others_posts)
* [delete\_pages](#delete_pages)
* [delete\_posts](#delete_posts)
* [delete\_private\_pages](#delete_private_pages)
* [delete\_private\_posts](#delete_private_posts)
* [delete\_published\_pages](#delete_published_pages)
* [delete\_published\_posts](#delete_published_posts)
* [edit\_dashboard](#edit_dashboard)
* [edit\_others\_pages](#edit_others_pages)
* [edit\_others\_posts](#edit_others_posts)
* [edit\_pages](#edit_pages)
* [edit\_posts](#edit_posts)

* [export](#export)
* [import](#import)
* [list\_users](#list_users)
* [manage\_categories](#manage_categories)
* [manage\_links](#manage_links)
* [manage\_options](#manage_options)
* [moderate\_comments](#moderate_comments)
* [promote\_users](#promote_users)
* [publish\_pages](#publish_pages)
* [publish\_posts](#publish_posts)
* [read\_private\_pages](#read_private_pages)

* [read](#read)
* [remove\_users](#remove_users)
* [switch\_themes](#switch_themes)
* [upload\_files](#upload_files)
* [customize](#customize)
* [delete\_site](#delete_site)

#### Additional Admin Capabilities

Only Administrators of single site installations have the following capabilities. In [Multisite](/support/article/glossary/#multisite), only the Super Admin has these abilities:

* [update\_core](#update_core)

### [Special Cases](#special-cases)

The following capabilities are special cases:

* [unfiltered\_upload](#unfiltered_upload) – This capability is not available to any role by default (including Super Admins). The capability needs to be enabled by defining the following constant:

```
define( 'ALLOW_UNFILTERED_UPLOADS', true );
```

With this constant defined, all roles on a single site install can be given the unfiltered\_upload capability, but only Super Admins can be given the capability on a Multisite install.

### [Capability vs. Role Table](#capability-vs-role-table)

# WordPress: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200703-23**

Wordpress contains several cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery
and information leak vulnerabilities.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/wordpress** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **2.1.2** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

WordPress is a popular personal publishing platform with a web
interface.

### Description

WordPress contains cross-site scripting or cross-site scripting forgery
vulnerabilities reported by:

* g30rg3\_x in the "year"
  parameter of the wp\_title() function
* Alexander Concha in the
  "demo" parameter of wp-admin/admin.php
* Samenspender and Stefan
  Friedli in the "post" parameter of wp-admin/post.php and
  wp-admin/page.php, in the "cat\_ID" parameter of wp-admin/categories.php
  and in the "c" parameter of wp-admin/comment.php
* PsychoGun in
  the "file" parameter of wp-admin/templates.php

Additionally, WordPress prints the full PHP script paths in some error
messages.

### Impact

The cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be triggered to steal
browser session data or cookies. A remote attacker can entice a user to
browse to a specially crafted web page that can trigger the cross-site
request forgery vulnerability and perform arbitrary WordPress actions
with the permissions of the user. Additionally, the path disclosure
vulnerability could help an attacker to perform other attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all these
vulnerabilities.

### Resolution

Due to the numerous recently discovered vulnerabilities in WordPress,
this package has been masked in the portage tree. All WordPress users
are advised to unmerge it.

```

 # emerge --unmerge "www-apps/wordpress"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
