  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2007-1552",
    "description": "A security bug has been discovered in MetaForum 0.513 Beta. This bug can be used by an attacker to upload a malicious php file on the server. During the upload, the MIME type of the file is the only verified parameter. The extension isn't. This enables an attacker to fake the MIME type of a php file so that it is considered as an image.",
    "root_cause": "The application only checks the MIME type of the uploaded file and does not validate the file extension.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unrestricted File Upload",
      "Insufficient Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP files, to the server, leading to remote code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be exploited by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., image/jpeg) but a malicious extension (e.g., .php)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server. They must also have an account with the ability to upload images.",
    "additional_details": [
       "The provided exploit code first logs into a valid user account, then sends a multipart/form-data POST request to upload a file with a faked MIME type.",
        "The suggested solution involves replacing the vulnerable line of code in usercp.php with a more secure version, that checks both the MIME type and the file extension"
    ]
