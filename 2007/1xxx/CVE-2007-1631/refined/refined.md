Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a variable `$header` in an `@include` statement within the `signup.php` file. The value of `$header` is hardcoded to `../header.php`, but the application allows user-controlled input to override it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is a potential Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to the use of `@include "$header";`. If the `$header` variable could be modified by a malicious user, they could include external or local files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker could include a malicious file containing PHP code. This allows for arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Data exposure:** Attackers could include sensitive files from the server, potentially exposing confidential data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through manipulating the `$header` variable in `signup.php`. The message suggests this variable is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing it to be modified by the user, thus including an attacker specified file

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to somehow control or modify the `$header` variable before it is used in the `include` statement.
