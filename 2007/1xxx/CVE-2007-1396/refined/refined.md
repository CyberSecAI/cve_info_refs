Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1396:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The SUSE Security Announcement (SUSE-SA:2007:044) explicitly lists CVE-2007-1396 as a cross-reference, confirming its relevance.
   - The announcement describes the vulnerability as a "possible super-global overwrite inside import_request_variables()".

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a flaw in the `import_request_variables()` function within PHP. This function can be exploited to overwrite superglobal variables.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - The vulnerability is a super-global overwrite, meaning an attacker can manipulate values of PHP's built-in superglobal arrays (`$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_COOKIE`, etc.) through specially crafted requests.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Control Flow Manipulation:** By overwriting superglobals, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code or manipulate existing code logic by influencing parameters. This can result in a wide range of impacts, from denial of service to remote code execution if the application code is not careful.
   - **Data Tampering:** An attacker could alter the expected behavior of an application by modifying the input data before the application's code has a chance to process and sanitize it properly.
   - **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, manipulation of superglobal variables could lead to privilege escalation, if not handled properly, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered through manipulated HTTP requests (GET, POST, COOKIE). An attacker sends requests containing parameters designed to overwrite superglobal variables.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through the web interface, requiring no local access to the server.
   - **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the target server to send the malicious HTTP requests.
   - **Understanding of PHP**: The attacker needs knowledge of how `import_request_variables()` works and the specific structure of PHP's superglobal arrays.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in both PHP 4 and PHP 5 versions, specifically the versions mentioned in the SUSE advisory and the PHP release notes.
- The provided content from `php.net` confirms that this vulnerability was fixed in PHP 4.4.7 and 5.2.2.
- The security impact was rated as 7 out of 10 by SUSE.

**Summary of extracted information:**
- **Root cause:** A flaw in the `import_request_variables()` function allowing superglobal overwrite.
- **Weakness:** Ability to modify PHP's superglobal variables through crafted requests.
- **Impact:** Control flow manipulation, data tampering, and potentially privilege escalation.
- **Attack vector:** Manipulated HTTP requests (GET, POST, COOKIE).
- **Attacker capabilities:** Remote network access and knowledge of PHP.
