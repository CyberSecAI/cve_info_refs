Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-1462:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how the web application, specifically the "Add System/Cluster task flow" in `conga`, handles passwords. Instead of storing the password securely in the server session between page loads, it is sent back to the browser as the 'value' attribute within the password input field of the HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposure of Plaintext Passwords:** The primary weakness is that the password, which is intended to be confidential, is included as plain text in the HTML source code of the web page.
- **Insecure Handling of Sensitive Data:** The application fails to handle sensitive password information securely by exposing it in client-side code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Password Disclosure:** An attacker who views the HTML source of the webpage could obtain the user's password in plaintext. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the remote system for which the password was entered.
- **Compromise of Remote System:** Access to the remote system would have the potential to lead to further compromise, depending on the permissions and access granted to that account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **View Source:** An attacker would need to be able to view the HTML source code of the web page where the password input field is present. This could be achieved through direct access to the user's machine, or potentially by intercepting the traffic if SSL was not in use.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to User's Browser:** An attacker must have the ability to view the HTML source code within the user's web browser. This could be achieved by local access, or if a man-in-the-middle attack could bypass the SSL layer.
- **User must have submitted form**: The attacker must view the page after the user has entered and submitted the password as part of the 'Add System/Cluster task flow'

**Additional Notes from the Bugzilla entry:**

*   The issue was considered to have a low security impact due to the required circumstances for exploitation.
*   The vulnerability is mitigated (but not eliminated) by the use of HTTPS, which prevents man-in-the-middle attacks from intercepting the password en route.
*   The bug was resolved with a fix included in the RHBA-2007:0331 advisory.
