How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

In Apple's [Designing AirPort Extreme 802.11n Networks](http://www.apple.com/support/manuals/)

manual there is a cryptic line:

"This version of AirPort Utility supports IPv6."

Upon further examination (page 53), it turns out that the Airport Utility

has a tab titled "IPv6" hidden away in the Advanced settings. There, you can

select one of three IPv6 modes:

* Link-local only
* Node
* Tunnel

Curiously, there is no option to turn [IPv6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipv6) off—fear not, read on. The default setting is to have an automatically configured tunnel. This means that if the base station gets a "real" IP address on its WAN interface (i.e., not one that starts with 10, 172.16 - 172.32 or 192.168), it automatically creates a range of IPv6 addresses from its IPv4 address, and connects to the IPv6 Internet through public gateways scattered throughout the 'Net.

Hosts on the LAN side of the AEBS that have IPv6 turned on (the default on MacOS X Tiger and Windows Vista) will then, after a short delay, get an IPv6 address from the base station, allowing them to connect to servers that are also on the IPv6 Internet using the new protocol. For instance, go to [APNIC](http://www.apnic.net/) (the people who distribute IP addresses in the Asia-Pacific region) and you'll see your IP address in the top-left corner of the page. If the address looks a lot longer than usual... you're on IPv6! Boring old IPv4 is used to reach destinations that haven't adopted the new protocol yet.

Here's the potential issue, though: even though in most configurations, the Airport Extreme will act as a simple firewall and reject incoming sessions over IPv4, it lets incoming IPv6 sessions straight through. That is, unless you go in and enable the "Block incoming IPv6 connections" setting in Advanced > IPv6 for the base station. If you don't block incoming IPv6 sessions, y*ou can actually connect to a Mac sitting behind the Airport Extreme from the outside*, using SSH or FTP over IPv6, assuming those services are enabled. Long story short, you've lost your first line of defense on your home network for IPv6-enabled servers on your Macs.

If this doesn't sit well with you, we're advising users who don't absolutely need IPv6 (that's most of you!) to disable the IPv6 gateway functionality by selecting one of the other IPv6 modes. In link-local only mode, the AEBS won't be able to talk IPv6 beyond the local ethernet.
