  "cve": "CVE-2007-1057",
  "description": "The Nortel VPN client for UNIX systems (including Linux and Mac OSX) prior to version 6.05, suffers from a local privilege escalation vulnerability. When the client is initiated, it downloads a zip archive to /tmp, which contains three binaries (askpass, client, and surun). These files are extracted to /tmp/NetClient and are made world-writable. The 'surun' binary executes 'askpass' to get the root password and then executes 'client' via /bin/su. A race condition exists, allowing an unprivileged local user to replace the client binary with a malicious version before it's executed by surun as root, resulting in local privilege escalation.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A race condition in combination with insecure file permissions allows a local user to escalate privileges to root.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file permissions: The downloaded binaries are extracted to a world-writable directory (/tmp/NetClient) and given world-writable permissions using chmod a+xw, allowing any local user to modify them.",
      "Race condition: A time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition exists where an attacker can replace the legitimate 'client' binary after the permissions are set but before it is executed by 'surun' with root privileges."
    ],
    "impact": "A local, unprivileged user can gain root privileges on the system. This allows the attacker to perform any action on the system that root can.",
     "attack_vectors": "Local access is required. The attacker must have access to a system where a user runs the vulnerable Nortel VPN client.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to write to the filesystem and must be able to execute arbitrary code."
