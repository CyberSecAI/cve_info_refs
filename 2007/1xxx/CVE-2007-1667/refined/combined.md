# Linux Terminal Server Project: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-07**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in components shipped with
LTSP which allow remote attackers to compromise terminal clients.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/ltsp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

The Linux Terminal Server Project adds thin-client support to Linux
servers.

### Description

LTSP version 4.2, ships prebuilt copies of programs such as the Linux
Kernel, the X.org X11 server (GLSA 200705-06, GLSA 200710-16, GLSA
200801-09), libpng (GLSA 200705-24, GLSA 200711-08), Freetype (GLSA
200705-02, GLSA 200705-22) and OpenSSL (GLSA 200710-06, GLSA 200710-30)
which were subject to multiple security vulnerabilities since 2006.
Please note that the given list of vulnerabilities might not be
exhaustive.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly exploit vulnerabilities in the
aforementioned programs and execute arbitrary code, disclose sensitive
data or cause a Denial of Service within LTSP 4.2 clients.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

LTSP 4.2 is not maintained upstream in favor of version 5. Since
version 5 is not yet available in Gentoo, the package has been masked.
We recommend that users unmerge LTSP:

```
 # emerge --unmerge net-misc/ltsp
```

If you have a requirement for Linux Terminal Servers, please either set
up a terminal server by hand or use one of the distributions that
already migrated to LTSP 5. If you want to contribute to the
integration of LTSP 5 in Gentoo, or want to follow its development,
find details in bug 177580.

# USN-453-1: X.org vulnerability

18 April 2007

X.org vulnerability

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

* **001: SECURITY FIX: November 4, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/httpd.8)
  does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when it is
  reflected back in an error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS)
  style attacks.
  [CVE-2006-3918](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3918)

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/001_httpd.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: November 4, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    Several problems have been found in OpenSSL. While parsing certain invalid ASN.1
    structures an error condition is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite
    loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function. A NULL
    pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
    applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
    public keys being used.
    [CVE-2006-2937](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2937),
    [CVE-2006-3738](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3738),
    [CVE-2006-4343](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4343),
    [CVE-2006-2940](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2940)

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/002_openssl.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: November 4, 2006**
        *All architectures*

      Fix for an integer overflow in
      [systrace(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/systrace.4)'s
      STRIOCREPLACE support, found by
      Chris Evans. This could be exploited for DoS, limited kmem reads or local
      privilege escalation.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/003_systrace.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 7, 2006**
          *All architectures*

        Due to a bug in the
        [arc(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/arc.4)
        RAID driver the driver will not properly synchronize the cache to the logical volumes
        upon system shut down. The result being that the mounted file systems within the logical
        volumes will not be properly marked as being clean and fsck will be run for the subsequent
        boot up.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/004_arc.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: November 19, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          The ELF
          [ld.so(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/ld.so.1)
          fails to properly sanitize the environment. There is a potential localhost security
          problem in cases we have not found yet. This patch applies to all ELF-based
          systems (m68k, m88k, and vax are a.out-based systems).

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/005_ldso.patch)

          * **006: FTP DISTRIBUTION ERROR: December 4, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            The **src.tar.gz** and **ports.tar.gz** archives
            released on FTP were created incorrectly, a week after the 4.0 release. The
            archives on the CD sets are correct; this only affects people who downloaded
            them from a [mirror](ftp.html).

            The archives have been corrected. The correct MD5 of
            [ports.tar.gz](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.0/ports.tar.gz) is eff352b4382a7fb7ffce1e8b37e9eb56, and for
            [src.tar.gz](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.0/src.tar.gz) it is b8d7a0dc6f3d27a5377a23d69c40688e.

              Insufficient validation in
              [vga(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/vga.4)
              may allow an attacker to gain root privileges if the kernel is compiled with
              `option PCIAGP`
              and the actual device is not an AGP device.
              The `PCIAGP` option is present by default on i386
              kernels only.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hash: SHA1

X.Org security advisory, April 3rd, 2007
Multiple vulnerability in X server, libXfont and libX11
CVE IDs: CVE-2007-1003 CVE-2007-1351 CVE-2007-1352 CVE-2007-1352

Overview

Lack of validation of parameters passed to the X server and libX11 by
client application can lead to various kinds of integer overflows or
stack overflows that can be used to overwrite data in the X server
memory.

Vulnerabilities details

* CVE-2007-1003 XC-MISC extension integer overflow

  iDefense Lab security researchers discovered that the parameter used
  for ALLOCATE_LOCAL in ProcXCMiscGetXIDList() is computed from an
  expression using a client-provided value that can be arbitrarily
  big. This can lead to an integer overflow in the evaluation of the
  expression or, when ALLOCATE_LOCAL() is using alloca(), to memory
  corruption if the parameter is big enough to fall out of the stack.

  The vulnerable request is only available to an already authenticated
  client of the X server .

* CVE 2007-1351 bdf font parsing integer overflow

  iDefense Lab security researchers discovered that the BDF font
  parsing code in libXfont lack some input validation checks,
  permitting a specially crafted font in the BDF format to trigger an
  integer overflow in the parameter to a call to xalloc() in the
  bdfReadCharacters() function in bdfread.c, leading to memory
  corruption.

  An attacker needs to already have access to the system either as an
  authenticated client of the running X server, or with the ability to
  (re)start the X server.

  This vulnerability also affects the Freetype 2 library up to an
  including 2.3.2 . Refer to the  Freetype web site to obtain a
  patch.

* CVE 2007-1352 fonts.dir file parsing integer overflow

  iDefense Lab security researcher have identified that the code
  parsing the fonts.dir file in libXfont lacks validation of the
  initial number of fonts declared in this file. This can be used to
  trigger an integer overflow in the computation of the parameter to
  xalloc() in the FontFileInitTable() function, leading to memory
  corruption.

  An attacker needs to already have access to the system either as an
  authenticated client of the running X server, or with the ability to

* CVE 2007-1667 libX11 XInitImage input validation

  Sami Leides has reported to the Debian BTS that some manually
  crafted images can lead to memory corruptions in libX11, due to
  incomplete input validation in XInitImage(), in ImUtils.c.
  It has be demonstrated that at least xwud and ImageMagick can be
  used to trigger calls to XInitImage() with incorrect parameters when
  viewing a malicious image. Other image viewing programs can probably
  be used too.

  This vulnerability can be exploited by having the user already
  connected to the X server to launch a viewer on the malicious
  image.

Affected versions

All released X.Org versions of xserver, libX11 and libXfont are
vulnerable to the respective problems. Other X window system
implementations based on the X11R6 sample implementation are probably
vulnerable too.

Fix

Apply one of the following patches

X.Org 7.2
<http://xorg.freedesktop.org/archive/X11R7.2/patches/>

MD5: d52da02163cd401b99b6e3a08d7ff068 xorg-libX11-1.1.1-xinitimage.diff
SHA1: a0f904115ad9dc441bebcf2f8267f9751322b727
xorg-libX11-1.1.1-xinitimage.diff

MD5: 76e3330c9bace76318e096b3c2182101 xorg-libXfont-1.2.7-bdf-fontdir.diff
SHA1: 3e57aca6215e1212e53b1a3b1d243916ac7fa703
xorg-libXfont-1.2.7-bdf-fontdir.diff

MD5: 0fa07a8fb2bc14fa01fc29e42b89c59e xorg-xserver-1.2.0-xcmisc.diff
SHA1: 3557cbe23be6912106ed7220d95301311fb93a26
xorg-xserver-1.2.0-xcmisc.diff

These patches can be applied to earlier versions of X.Org too with a
few manual tweaks.

Thanks

Sean Larsson of iDefense Labs discovered the XC-MISC vulnerability and
provided sample code and advices in fixing it.

Debian Bug     : 418057 412945 444267 530838

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the imagemagick image
manipulation programs which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code,
exposure of sensitive information or cause DoS. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-1667

   Multiple integer overflows in XInitImage function in xwd.c for
   ImageMagick, allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a	denial of
   service (crash) or obtain sensitive information via crafted images with
   large or negative values that trigger a buffer overflow. It only affects
   the oldstable distribution (etch).

CVE-2007-1797

   Multiple integer overflows allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
   code via a crafted DCM image, or the colors or comments field in a
   crafted XWD image. It only affects the oldstable distribution (etch).

CVE-2007-4985

   A crafted image file can trigger an infinite loop in the ReadDCMImage
   function or in the ReadXCFImage function. It only affects the oldstable
   distribution (etch).

CVE-2007-4986

   Multiple integer overflows allow context-dependent attackers to execute
   arbitrary code via a crafted .dcm, .dib, .xbm, .xcf, or .xwd image file,
   which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. It only affects the
   oldstable distribution (etch).

CVE-2007-4987

   Off-by-one error allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary
   code via a crafted image file, which triggers the writing of a '\0'
   character to an out-of-bounds address. It affects only the oldstable
   distribution (etch).

CVE-2007-4988

   A sign extension error allows context-dependent attackers to execute
   arbitrary code via a crafted width value in an image file, which
   triggers an integer overflow and a heap-based buffer overflow. It
   affects only the oldstable distribution (etch).

CVE-2008-1096

   The load_tile function in the XCF coder allows user-assisted remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
   code via a crafted .xcf file that triggers an out-of-bounds heap write.
   It affects only to oldstable (etch).

CVE-2008-1097

   Heap-based buffer overflow in the PCX coder allows user-assisted remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
   code via a crafted .pcx file that triggers incorrect memory allocation
   for the scanline array, leading to memory corruption. It affects only to
   oldstable (etch).

CVE-2009-1882

   Integer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF file,
   which triggers a buffer overflow.

For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7:6.2.4.5.dfsg1-0.15+etch1.

For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 7:6.3.7.9.dfsg2-1~lenny3.

For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version
7:6.5.1.0-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.

```
Package: imagemagick
Version: 7:6.2.4.5.dfsg1-0.14
Severity: normal

[Cc: to security team, as this almost certainly concerns them]

The attached files all crash imagemagick (eg. XXXtojpg $filename) on
amd64, some with SEGV, some with glibc detected heap corruption. I
consider it quite likely that some of these are exploitable, but as
I'm not sure, only filing as Severity: normal as to not annoy you :)

Whoops, sorry. The command that crashes is "convert broken.$format

Thanks. I've done a quick screening to investigate which of those affect
graphicsmagick, and have cloned individual bugs as I'm probably unable
to deal with all of them in one go. Bug severity might change once I've
had a closer look at the individual issues. Here's the detailed list for
current graphicsmagick:

Broken import
=============

The following coders show problems on "gm identify".

bmp:
        broken2.bmp ... Segmentation fault
icon (amd64 and ia64, i386 okay):
        broken.cur ... Segmentation fault
jp2:
        broken.jpc ... Segmentation fault
        broken2.jp2 ... Segmentation fault
        broken4.jp2 ... cannot get marker segment
        *** glibc detected *** double free or corruption (!prev): 0x0809d1b8 ***
        (hangs afterwards)
pcx:
        broken.dcx ... Segmentation fault
        broken.pcx ... Segmentation fault
png:
        broken.mng ... Segmentation fault
pict/jpeg:
        broken.pict ... Segmentation fault
pnm:
        broken2.ppm ... Segmentation fault

Broken conversion
=================

The following coders show no problems on "gm identify", but break with
"gm convert" to jpg and gif.

cineon:
        broken.cin ... Segmentation fault
sun:
        broken.sun ... Segmentation fault
xwd:
        broken.xwd ... Segmentation fault

Not affected
============

The following testcases did not show any problems with either
"gm identify" or "gm convert" on i386, amd64, and ia64.

jp2 (but affected by other testcases):
        broken.jp2 ... error: no code stream found
        gm identify: Unable to decode image file (broken.jp2).
        broken3.jp2 ... error: no code stream found
        gm identify: Unable to decode image file (broken3.jp2).
sgi:
        broken.sgi ... gm identify: Improper image header (broken.sgi).

I'll look into each of these in more detail and use the separate bugs
for tracking.

Regards,

Daniel.

While not a problem in imagemagick/graphicsmagick themselves, this turns
out as the most grave bug the testcases have uncovered so far. The
*magick XWD coder initializes an XImage structure from a user-supplied
image in X window dump format, passes it to libX11's XInitImage() for
validation, properly checking its return value. Later on it uses
XGetPixel() to obtain individual pixel values.

The broken.xwd testcase supplied in the original bug report contains
specifies a very large bit_per_pixel value. XInitImage() does not check
this case and validates the image. Calling XGetPixel() with the bogus
XImage structure causes an overflow of the px variable that is allocated
on the stack of function _XGetPixel() in src/ImUtil.c. Similar scenarios
arise for different image variants if the bitmap_unit member of XImage
contains excessively large values. The first attached patch is
completely untested so please check before applying. It adds more sanity
checks to XInitImage() to prevent the described buffer overflows in
XGetPixel(). I haven't considered other code paths, so the patch might
not be comprehensive. The second attached patch extends the
graphicsmagick code by a few more sanity checks to plug the hole even
with the present libX11, but from my reading of XInitImage man page,
libX11 ought to take of this itself.

I've done the analysis on an etch system, identical code is already
present in the affected functions in xfree86 on sarge, though. Looks
like stable requires an update as well.

Regards,

Daniel.

Daniel -

For both the broken.xwd and broken2.xwd files in bug #414045,
the offending operation is in libx11-1.0.3/src/ImUtil.c:505
   dst++ = *src++;
and in fact it's the src pointer that is out of range.
This suggests it's "only" a DOS problem, or at worst an
information leak problem, but no direct exploit is possible.

A few lines earlier, the src pointer is computed as
      src = &ximage->data[ZINDEX(x, y, ximage)];
where ZINDEX is the macro
#define ZINDEX(x, y, img) ((y) * img->bytes_per_line) + \
    (((x) * img->bits_per_pixel) >> 3)

In the broken.xwd case, x = 0, y = 1838, ximage->bytes_per_line = 66148,
and ximage->bits_per_pixel = 24.  So it's no surprise that
attempting to read ximage->data[121580024] generates a segfault.

broken2.xwd is similar, but the overflow is in the x direction.

The call to XGetPixel in both cases is at
graphicsmagick-1.1.7/coders/xwd.c:388 .

I'll try to figure out which routine should check the indexes
(and against what).

   - Larry

So you're saying the remaining problem is in graphicsmagick, not Xlib?

I recommend further testing and investigation by others.
My analysis showed a clear bug in graphicsmagick, and I
posted a fix for it.  When I retested, only broken.xwd was
fixed by that patch.

So this bug may need to be cloned again, to separate
broken.xwd and broken2.xwd.  Either that, or someone can
quickly come up with a proper fix to broken2.xwd, and
close the pair out together.  But I don't yet know whether
that fix belongs in libx11 or graphicsmagick.

I previously posted a patch for graphicsmagick that fixes broken.xwd.
Here is a patch for libx11 that fixes broken2.xwd.

I thought about possible ways to fixing broken.xwd in libx11, or
broken2.xwd in graphicsmagick, and I don't think it's possible or
desirable.  So I guess this bug needs to be split, and each package
patched.

With this patch included (replaces 022_XInitImage_input_validate.diff),

$ gm convert broken2.xwd temp.png
gm convert: Unrecognized XWD header (broken2.xwd) [No such file or directory].

Other than adding an extraneous errno = EINVAL to userspace,
I don't see how to avoid the inapplicable error string.

Please test, and forward upstream.

    - Larry

Add more input validation to XInitImage(), to avoid buffer overflow in
XGetPixel(), which assumes sane values.
Debian bug #414045.

Well, you don't have to be a DD to make those changes; and anyway, there are
plenty of eyeballs on the release-critical bugs who will help if you do
misstep. :)

Anyway, I've done the first two bits, the third seems like something for
someone closer to the bug.

I don't see any particular reason that graphicsmagick should be specially
discriminated against by the security team when it comes to segfaults on
untrusted input, so I'm leaving the severity at 'grave' for now.

Thanks,

# X.Org X11 library: Multiple integer overflows — GLSA **200705-06**

The X.Org X11 library contains multiple integer overflows, which could lead
to the execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **x11-libs/libX11** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.3-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.3-r2** |

### Background

X.Org is an implementation of the X Window System. The X.Org X11
library provides the X11 protocol library files.

### Description

Multiple integer overflows have been reported in the XGetPixel()
function of the X.Org X11 library.

### Impact

By enticing a user to open a specially crafted image, an attacker could
cause a Denial of Service or an integer overflow, potentially resulting
in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All X.Org X11 library users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/libX11-1.0.3-r2"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-03-30 06:30:49 UTC  ``` A bug recently showed up in the Debian BTS that describes an integer overflow in X's XGetPixel() function  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=414045>  The report incorrectly states it is a buffer overflow.  The bug also has a proposed patch and reproducer for this flaw.  The issue is that the XInitImage() function allows the caller to supply silly values, which can cause several integer overflow.  A call to XGetPixel() can also result in integer overflows.  While one would expect the calling application to sanitize the data passed to XInitImage(), the library should also be smart enough to prevent the caller from giving it bad data. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-03-30 06:32:25 UTC  ``` x11 please advise. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Donnie Berkholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-03-30 07:39:41 UTC  ``` Quoting from <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=414045;msg=85> -- in particular, see the end of this quote for security relevance.  "For both the broken.xwd and broken2.xwd files in [bug #414045](show_bug.cgi?id=414045 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-python/cvxopt-1.1.5 cholmod.so module isn't linked to blas as it should and is in 1.1.4-r1"), the offending operation is in libx11-1.0.3/src/ImUtil.c:505    dst++ = *src++; and in fact it's the src pointer that is out of range. This suggests it's "only" a DOS problem, or at worst an information leak problem, but no direct exploit is possible." ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-03-30 07:50:42 UTC  ``` I'm not sure of the severity but RH states integer overflow and the bug with the patch is restricted (<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=231694>)  Should we just put it as upstream until more information becomes available (ie. CVE id)?   ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Donnie Berkholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-03-30 17:08:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=172752#c3)) > Should we just put it as upstream until more information becomes available (ie. > CVE id)?  Sure, if you want. But there seems to be a CVE ID in the subject already.. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-03-30 19:52:41 UTC  ``` Donnie if you're eager to commit just go ahead, I was just being cautious :)  Though CVE ids can be both rejected and contested, so the id in itself doesn't guarantee anything other than giving a common naming system across vendors. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-04 06:39:42 UTC  ``` Redhat issued an errata here (this also covers the issues from [bug #172575](show_bug.cgi?id=172575 "RESOLVED FIXED - x11-libs/libXfont BDF Font Parsing and xc-misc Integer Overflow (CVE-2007-{135{1|2}|1003})")):  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0125.html> ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Donnie Berkholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-05 07:02:01 UTC  ``` Arches need to stable x11-libs/libX11-1.0.3-r2 or libX11-1.1.1-r1, at their option. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  DrChandra the Gentoo Person    2007-04-05 19:26:42 UTC  ``` libX11-1.1.1-r1.ebuild was recently introduced into ~x86 to do nothing different but additionally apply this patch:  xorg-libX11-1.1.1-xinitimage.diff  The cvs comment for the change refers to the number of this bug.  I had to downdrade to libX11-1.1.1 because this change causes opera to segfault. I recommend *not* stablizing this change. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Donnie Berkholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-05 22:50:15 UTC  ``` Perhaps this should block on [bug #173505](show_bug.cgi?id=173505 "RESOLVED FIXED - x11-libs/libX11-1.1.1-r1 makes www-client/opera segfault"). ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-11 10:28:58 UTC  ``` As far as I can see from that bug it's a bug in the client application and not in the patch itself so I suppose we can start marking this one stable. Donnie what do you say? ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Donnie Berkholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-11 18:15:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=172752#c10)) > As far as I can see from that bug it's a bug in the client application and not > in the patch itself so I suppose we can start marking this one stable.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CVE ID         : CVE-2007-1003 CVE-2007-1351 CVE-2007-1352 CVE-2007-1667

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X Window System,
which may lead to privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-1003

    Sean Larsson discovered an integer overflow in the XC-MISC extension,
    which might lead to denial of service or local privilege escalation.

CVE-2007-1351

    Greg MacManus discovered an integer overflow in the font handling,
    which might lead to denial of service or local privilege escalation.

CVE-2007-1352

    Greg MacManus discovered an integer overflow in the font handling,
    which might lead to denial of service or local privilege escalation.

CVE-2007-1667

    Sami Leides discovered an integer overflow in the libx11 library
    which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
    This update introduces tighter sanity checking of input passed to
    XCreateImage(). To cope with this an updated rdesktop package is
    delivered along with this security update. Another application
    reported to break is the proprietary Opera browser, which isn't
    part of Debian. The vendor has released updated packages, though.

For the old stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.0.dfsg.1-14sarge4. This update lacks builds for the Sparc
architecture, due to problems on the build host. Packages will be released
once this problem has been resolved.

The stable distribution (etch) isn't affected by these problems, as the
vulnerabilities have already been fixed during the Etch preparation
freeze phase.

We recommend that you upgrade your XFree86 packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=231684#c0)  Josh Bressers    2007-03-09 22:36:55 UTC  ``` A bug recently showed up in the Debian BTS that describes an integer overflow in X's XGetPixel() function  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=414045>  The report incorrectly states it is a buffer overflow.  The bug also has a proposed patch and reproducer for this flaw.  The issue is that the XInitImage() function allows the caller to supply silly values, which can cause several integer overflow.  A call to XGetPixel() can also result in integer overflows.  While one would expect the calling application to sanitize the data passed to XInitImage(), the library should also be smart enough to prevent the caller from giving it bad data.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=231684#c1)  Josh Bressers    2007-03-09 22:38:48 UTC  ``` This flaw should also affect RHEL2.1   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=231684#c2)  Matěj Cepl    2007-03-12 23:35:39 UTC  ``` Patches from the Debian bug were attached to the RHEL 5 clone of this bug -- [bug 231694](show_bug.cgi?id=231694 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2007-1667 XGetPixel() integer overflow").   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=231684#c5)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-04-03 19:15:18 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0125.html>    ``` |  |

  Impact: Passwords supplied to dscl are exposed to other local users

  Description: The dscl command-line tool required that passwords be passed to it in its arguments, potentially exposing the passwords to other local users. Passwords exposed include those for users and administrators. This update makes the password parameter optional, and dscl will prompt for the password if needed. Credit: Apple.

* **fetchmail**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2007-4565, CVE-2008-2711

  Impact: Other local users may access the Downloads folder

  Description: A default permissions issue exists in Folder Manager. When a user deletes their Downloads folder and Folder Manager recreates it, the folder is created with read permissions for everyone. This update addresses the issue by having Folder Manager limit permissions so that the folder is accessible only to the user. This issue only affects applications using Folder Manager. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit to Graham Perrin of CENTRIM, University of Brighton for reporting this issue.

* **FSEvents**

  CVE-ID: CVE-2009-0015

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.6, Mac OS X Server v10.5.6

  Impact: Using the FSEvents framework, a local user may be able to see filesystem activity that would otherwise not be available

  Description: A credential management issue exists in fseventsd. By using the FSEvents framework, a local user may be able to see filesystem activity that would otherwise not be available. This includes the name of a directory which the user would not otherwise be able to see, and the detection of activity in the directory at a given time. This update addresses the issue through improved credential validation in fseventsd. This issue does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.5. Credit to Mark Dalrymple for reporting this issue.

* **Network Time**

Issued:
2007-04-03
Updated:
2007-04-03
# RHSA-2007:0125 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Important: XFree86 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Topic

Updated XFree86 packages that fix a number of security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

XFree86 is an implementation of the X Window System, which provides the
core functionality for the Linux graphical desktop.

iDefense reported an integer overflow flaw in the XFree86 XC-MISC
extension. A malicious authorized client could exploit this issue to cause
a denial of service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with root
privileges on the XFree86 server. (CVE-2007-1003)

iDefense reported two integer overflows in the way X.org handled various
font files. A malicious local user could exploit these issues to
potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the X.org server.
(CVE-2007-1351, CVE-2007-1352)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the XFree86 XGetPixel() function.
Improper use of this function could cause an application calling it to
function improperly, possibly leading to a crash or arbitrary code
execution. (CVE-2007-1667)

Users of XFree86 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch and is not vulnerable to this issue.

## Solution

* **001: SECURITY FIX: March 25, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  A race condition has been reported to exist in the handling by sendmail of
  asynchronous signals. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running sendmail, typically root. This is the second revision of
  this patch.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/001_sendmail.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: May 2, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server --
    [CVE-2006-1526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526).
    Clients authorized to connect to the X server are able to crash it and to execute
    malicious code within the X server.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/002_xorg.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2006**
        *All architectures*

      A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
      message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
      This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
      delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
      delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
      malformed MIME message exists.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/003_sendmail2.patch)

      * **004: SECURITY FIX: July 30, 2006**
          *All architectures*

        [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/httpd.8)'s
        mod\_rewrite has a potentially exploitable off-by-one buffer overflow.
        The buffer overflow may result in a vulnerability which, in combination
        with certain types of Rewrite rules in the web server configuration files,
        could be triggered remotely. The default install is not affected by the
        buffer overflow. CVE-2006-3747

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/004_httpd.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A message
          with really long header lines could trigger a use-after-free bug causing
          sendmail to crash.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/005_sendmail3.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            Due to an off-by-one error in
            [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/dhcpd.8),
            it is possible to cause
            [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/dhcpd.8)
            to exit by sending a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32-byte client identifier option.
            [CVE-2006-3122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3122)

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/006_dhcpd.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                *All architectures*

              It is possible to cause the kernel to panic when more than the default number of
              semaphores have been allocated.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/007_sem.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                  *All architectures*

                A problem in
                [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/isakmpd.8)
                caused IPsec to run partly without replay protection. If
                [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/isakmpd.8)
                was acting as responder during SA negotiation, SA's with a replay window of size 0 were created.
                An attacker could reinject sniffed IPsec packets, which will be accepted without checking the
                replay counter.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/008_isakmpd.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: September 2, 2006**
                    *All architectures*

                  Due to the failure to correctly validate LCP configuration option lengths,
                  it is possible for an attacker to send LCP packets via an
                  [sppp(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/sppp.4)
                  connection causing the kernel to panic.
                  [CVE-2006-4304](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4304)

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/009_sppp.patch)

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: September 8, 2006**
                      *All architectures*

                    Two Denial of Service issues have been found with BIND.
                    An attacker who can perform recursive lookups on a DNS server and is able
                    to send a sufficiently large number of recursive queries, or is able to
                    get the DNS server to return more than one SIG(covered) RRsets can stop
                    the functionality of the DNS service.
                    An attacker querying an authoritative DNS server serving a RFC 2535
                    DNSSEC zone may be able to crash the DNS server.
                    [CVE-2006-4095](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4095)
                    [CVE-2006-4096](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4096)

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/010_bind.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: September 8, 2006**
                        *All architectures*

                      Due to incorrect PKCS#1 v1.5 padding validation in OpenSSL, it is possible for
                      an attacker to construct an invalid signature which OpenSSL would accept as a
                      valid PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.
                      [CVE-2006-4339](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4339)

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/011_openssl.patch)

                      * **012: SECURITY FIX: October 7, 2006**
                          *All architectures*

                        [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/httpd.8)
                        does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when it is
                        reflected back in an error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS)
                        style attacks.
                        [CVE-2006-3918](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3918)

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/012_httpd2.patch)

                        * **013: SECURITY FIX: October 7, 2006**
                            *All architectures*

                          Several problems have been found in OpenSSL. While parsing certain invalid ASN.1
                          structures an error condition is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite
                          loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function. A NULL
                          pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
                          applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
                          public keys being used.
                          [CVE-2006-2937](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2937),

# USN-481-1: ImageMagick vulnerabilities

10 July 2007

ImageMagick vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in ImageMagick's handling of DCM and

WXD image files. By tricking a user into processing a specially crafted

image with an application that uses imagemagick, an attacker could

execute arbitrary code with the user's privileges.
