      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine, demonstrated by executing calc.exe.",
      "attack_vector": "The attacker hosts a malicious news server. The victim is tricked into setting their newsgroup server to the attacker's IP and grabbing a malicious article. The overflow occurs when the software handles the overly long filename from the crafted article.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious news server and convince the victim to connect to this server using NewsReactor, as well as to grab an article."
