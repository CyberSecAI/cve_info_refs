The provided content indicates that the reported vulnerability in the Xoops Module Virii Info <= 1.10 (index.php) is **bogus**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The initial claim was a Remote File Include vulnerability in `index.php`. However, the analysis revealed that the include statements in the module's files correctly include necessary Xoops files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The analysis reveals that there isn't a Remote File Include vulnerability. The `index.php` includes the required `header.php` which in turn includes necessary files such as `mainfile.php`. It was found that the security measures in `class/xoopssecurity.php`, specifically `checkSuperglobals()`, prevent attempts to manipulate variables. If `register_globals` is enabled, it's possible to bypass the initial check by setting `xoopsOption[nocommon]`, but further execution will fail due to an undefined `SMARTY_DIR` variable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
There is no exploitation possible. The analysis shows that script execution will halt at the `class/template.php` stage due to missing definitions.

**Attack vectors:**
The original claimed attack vector was a Remote File Include in `index.php`, but the analysis proves it's non-existent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to find a way to exploit a non-existent remote file include. With the protections in place, this was found to be not possible.

In summary, this information demonstrates that the vulnerability initially reported was false and there is no actual vulnerability to exploit.
