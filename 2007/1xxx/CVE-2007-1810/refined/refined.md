    "ID": "CVE-2007-1810",
    "content": "The provided content relates to CVE-2007-1810.\n\nThe vulnerability is a SQL injection in the XOOPS Module Kshop version 1.17 or earlier. \n\nRoot cause:\nThe vulnerability exists in the product_details.php script of the Kshop module where the 'id' parameter is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject SQL queries through the 'id' parameter. \n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities: \n- SQL injection: The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning that the attacker may not see the results of their queries directly, but can infer the data by observing changes in the application's behavior. \n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- The impact of successful exploitation is that an attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials (usernames and passwords). The provided exploit specifically targets the xoops_users table to extract usernames and passwords. \n\nAttack vectors:\n- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the vulnerable product_details.php script via the 'id' parameter. The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query and injects it into this parameter. \n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the server hosting the vulnerable application. They also need to understand how to construct a SQL injection query to extract the data from the database."
