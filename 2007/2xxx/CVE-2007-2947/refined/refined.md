  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application uses a variable, `root_prefix`, to include files, without proper sanitization, leading to remote file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `root_prefix` parameter in the URL to point to a malicious file hosted on a remote server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a publicly accessible server to host the malicious file."
