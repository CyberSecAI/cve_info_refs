- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The script initializes a variable `$dir` to `.` and later overwrites it if a `gallery` parameter is set in the session. If a session exists and the `gallery` parameter is set within that session, the script uses the value of the parameter to include a file via `include($dir.'/gallery.inc.php')`. This allows an attacker to control the included file path, which can be a local or remote file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The script uses a user-controlled parameter (`$_SESSION['gallery']`) to construct the path for an `include` statement without proper sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file. The impact can range from data theft to complete server compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through an HTTP request with a 'gallery' parameter passed in the session. The attacker needs to make sure the session is new or reset and use the `gallery` parameter to point to a malicious file they control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP request to the vulnerable web server, create a session, and control a location where a malicious script can be accessed (either locally or remotely through methods like a shared network folder, as `http://` method will not work because of `file_exists()`).
