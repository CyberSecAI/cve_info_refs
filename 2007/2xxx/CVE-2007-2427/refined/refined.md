Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2427

**Vulnerable Software:** PostNuke pnFlashGames Module v1.5

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `cid` parameter when viewing flash games.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, where unsanitized user-supplied input is used in an SQL query, allowing for potential modification of the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and passwords.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** By obtaining user credentials, an attacker may gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `index.php` file of the vulnerable application. The `cid` parameter in the request is manipulated to inject SQL commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft a SQL injection payload that extracts relevant information.

**Technical Details:**
*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract data from the `pn_users` table.
*   The attacker injects the SQL statement into the `cid` parameter with values such as `-1/**/union/**/select/**/0,pn_uname,2,pn_pass,...`
* The example url provided is `index.php?module=pnFlashGames&func=view&cid=-1/**/union/**/select/**/0,pn_uname,2,pn_pass,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13/**/from/**/pn_users/**/where/**/pn_uid=2/*`

The provided exploit URL demonstrates how an attacker can retrieve usernames and passwords from the database, indicating the severity of the SQL injection vulnerability.
