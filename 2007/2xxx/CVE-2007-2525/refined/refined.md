{
  "CVE-2007-2525": {
    "description": "A flaw was discovered in the PPP over Ethernet implementation. Local attackers could manipulate ioctls and cause kernel memory consumption leading to a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "A memory leak occurs in the PPPOE subsystem when releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to memory exhaustion.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local attackers could manipulate ioctls to trigger the vulnerability",
       "Creating a socket using connect and releasing it before the PPPIOCGCHAN ioctl is called."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local attacker with the ability to manipulate ioctls or create sockets.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by local users by releasing the socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it, which results in a memory leak, and leading to a DoS by consuming available memory.  The ioctl PPPIOCGCHAN is specific to the PPP over Ethernet implementation."
