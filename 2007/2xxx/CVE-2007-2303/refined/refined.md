```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input passed to the 'template' parameter in the 'footer.php' script, allowing for local file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server. This can lead to information disclosure (e.g., configuration files, database credentials) or, if combined with other vulnerabilities, potentially to remote code execution by including web server log files where attacker-injected code has been logged.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL that contains a path to a file on the server in the 'template' parameter of the 'footer.php' script.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are required. The attacker must know the path of the file they wish to include."
