How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Corel / Micrografx ActiveCGM Browser ActiveX control buffer overflows

#### Vulnerability Note VU#983249

Original Release Date: 2007-06-13 | Last Revised: 2007-06-13

---

### Overview

The Corel / Micrografx ActiveCGM Browser ActiveX control contains multiple buffer overflows, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| The Corel [ActiveCGM Browser](http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Corel3/Products/Display&pid=1047022927836) is an ActiveX control that allows viewing of Computer Graphic Metafiles (CGMs) in a web browser. The ActiveCGM Browser ActiveX control, which is provided by acgm.dll, contains multiple buffer overflows. Note that the control was created by Micrografx, which was acquired by Corel. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause Internet Explorer (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This vulnerability is addressed in version 7.1.4.19 of the ActiveCGM Browser ActiveX control. Please check with your vendor for update availability. Also consider the following workarounds |
| --- |

| **Disable the ActiveCGM ActiveX control in Internet Explorer**The vulnerable ActiveX control can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSID:{F5D98C43-DB16-11cf-8ECA-0000C0FD59C7}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{F5D98C43-DB16-11cf-8ECA-0000C0FD59C7}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400**Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the "[Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer)" document. |
