    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-2592",
      "root_cause": "The bundled Apache Tomcat v5.0.25 suffers from an information disclosure vulnerability which allows an attacker to view the directory listing and the source code of the application.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Information Disclosure",
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Denial of Service (DoS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can view directory listings, obtain source code, list user accounts including mail server addresses, deactivate user accounts leading to DoS, and perform XSS attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Accessing specific URLs to trigger directory listing and source code disclosure.",
        "Accessing ASP scripts to list user accounts.",
        "Modifying user account status through ASP scripts.",
         "Injecting malicious scripts into vulnerable parameters in ASP scripts."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to perform these attacks. Access to the vulnerable application is needed.  An attacker only needs to send specially crafted HTTP requests.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present in Nokia Intellisync Mobile Suite and Wireless Email Express versions 6.4.31.2, 6.6.0.107, and 6.6.2.2, and may exist in other versions. The bundled Apache Tomcat v5.0.25 is vulnerable to directory listing and source code disclosure, while other vulnerabilities are located in the ASP scripts. Some ASP scripts lack input filtering, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Unauthenticated users can deactivate all user accounts causing denial of service"
