Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Taskhopper 1.1 component for Joomla/Mambo is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). This is due to the component's improper handling of the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter in several PHP files within its `/inc/` directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The component directly includes the content of the URL provided in `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter. This allows an attacker to include malicious files from a remote server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The component does not sanitize or validate the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter, making it possible to inject arbitrary URLs.
- **register_globals dependency:** The first source also points out the vulnerability works as long as `register_globals` is enabled. This php configuration option allows variables to be directly created from url parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server by including a malicious PHP file from a remote location.
- This can lead to complete compromise of the server and any data stored within.
- The attacker could achieve the following:
    - Gain unauthorized access to the system
    - Modify or delete data
    - Install backdoors
    - Steal sensitive information
    - Launch further attacks on other systems
- The attacker could also use the RFI to perform other attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending HTTP requests to vulnerable PHP files within the Taskhopper component, specifically by including the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter in the URL.
- The vulnerable files are located in the `/components/com_thopper/inc/` directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server where the vulnerable Taskhopper component is installed.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or user-level access to exploit the vulnerability, making it a remote vulnerability.
- The attacker needs a remote server under his control, to host the malicious payload that will be included by vulnerable server.

**Vulnerable files:**
- The identified vulnerable files are:
    - `contact_type.php`
    - `itemstatus_type.php`
    - `projectstatus_type.php`
    - `request_type.php`
    - `responses_type.php`
    - `timelog_type.php`
    - `urgency_type.php`

**More Detail than CVE:**
- This content provides more detail than a basic CVE description by listing the specific vulnerable files and the vulnerable parameter, as well as details about `register_globals` dependency and the impact of the attack.
