{
  "CVE-2007-2446": [
    {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists in the parsing of RPC requests to various RPC interfaces (SPOOLSS, DFS, SRVSVC, LSA). When parsing a request, heap allocation is calculated based on user input. By specifying invalid values, heap blocks can be overwritten.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient validation of user-controlled input sizes in RPC requests.",
           "Improper handling of Network Data Representation (NDR) encoded RPC parameters."
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on vulnerable Samba installations.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending specially crafted MS-RPC requests to the vulnerable interfaces.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with the ability to send network traffic to the Samba server. No user interaction is needed."
    },
     {
      "Root cause": "Samba contains several bugs when parsing NDR encoded RPC parameters.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Heap overflow vulnerability when parsing NDR encoded RPC parameters",
        "Improper sanitization of remote procedure input provided via Microsoft Remote Procedure Calls"
      ],
        "Impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges via various vectors.",
      "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker could send a specially crafted MS-RPC requests that could overwrite heap memory and execute arbitrary code.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker"
