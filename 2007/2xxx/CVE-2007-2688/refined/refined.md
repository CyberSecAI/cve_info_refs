Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-2688:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the failure of various HTTP content scanning systems to properly handle full-width/half-width Unicode encoded traffic. These encoding techniques can be used to represent characters in a way that may not be recognized or correctly processed by the scanning systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unicode Encoding Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass content scanning systems by encoding malicious HTTP traffic using full-width/half-width Unicode characters. This effectively allows attackers to obfuscate their payloads.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation/Normalization:** The affected systems lack proper input validation and normalization, which allows them to be tricked by these specific Unicode encodings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Security Measures:** A successful exploit allows attackers to bypass HTTP content scanning systems (such as intrusion detection/prevention systems or web application firewalls) intended to protect against malicious content.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Bypassing content scanning can enable various attacks, including but not limited to cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and other forms of web-based attacks, by allowing the malicious traffic to reach the application without being blocked.
*   **Compromise of System/Data:** The bypass may allow unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Traffic:** The attack vector involves sending specifically crafted HTTP traffic containing malicious payloads encoded with full-width/half-width Unicode characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the specific vulnerability and how to exploit it using the described Unicode encoding techniques.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability is exploitable by remote unauthenticated attackers

**Additional details:**

*   The CERT vulnerability note (VU#739224) provides a list of vendors known to be affected or not affected.
*   Some vendors released patches or updates to address the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Fatih Ozavci and Caglar Cakici of GamaSec.

In summary, this vulnerability allows attackers to bypass HTTP content scanning systems by using specific Unicode encoding, which can lead to various attacks on web applications.
