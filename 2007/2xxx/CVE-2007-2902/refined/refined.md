Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2902:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `my_progress.php` file of Dokeos version 1.8.0. The `course` parameter in the URL is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically within the `$_GET['course']` parameter in `my_progress.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** The attacker can retrieve sensitive information from the database. In the provided exploit, the attacker specifically aims to retrieve the admin's username and password hash from the `user` table.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** While this specific exploit focuses on retrieving user data, successful SQL injection can lead to more severe outcomes like data modification, deletion, or even complete database takeover.
- **Information Disclosure:** The exploit demonstrates the ability to bypass authentication to get sensitive information, such as username and password hash of the admin.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `my_progress.php` file with a maliciously crafted `course` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Dokeos application.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable `course` parameter in `my_progress.php`.
- **Existing User Account (student/teacher):** The exploit requires an already existing student or teacher account on the platform, as noted in the comments "Subject To: magic_quotes_gpc set to off & have an already existant student/teacher account".
- **Magic Quotes Disabled:** The server must have `magic_quotes_gpc` set to off, as indicated in the comments.
- **Session ID:** The exploit requires a valid session ID from a logged-in user to execute.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code retrieves the admin's username and password hash.
- The exploit also mentions the need to obtain a `SESSION_ID`, which can be retrieved via an XSS vulnerability.
- The exploit code itself is a Perl script that automates the SQL injection process, by using LWP::UserAgent.
- The exploit also mentions the presence of many XSS vulnerabilities in the Dokeos application.
