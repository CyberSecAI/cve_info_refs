```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized variables `$pseudo` and `$passe` in the login form allow for SQL injection in `admin/admin.php`.
    - **Code Injection:** The `admin/configurer2.php` file writes user-supplied data into a PHP configuration file without any sanitization, allowing for arbitrary code injection.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - **SQL Injection Vulnerability:** Lack of sanitization of user input in the login form leading to SQL injection
    - **Code Execution Vulnerability:** Unsanitized user input written directly into a PHP file, leading to arbitrary PHP code execution.
    - **Database Information Disclosure:**  The configuration page within the admin panel exposes database connection details.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - **Admin Access Bypass:** Successful SQL injection allows attackers to bypass the administrative login and gain access to the control panel.
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Through the configuration page, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
    - **Database Disclosure:** Attackers can access database connection information through the admin panel.
- Attack vectors:
    - **HTTP Requests:** Vulnerabilities are triggered through HTTP requests to specific PHP files (`admin/admin.php` and `admin/configurer2.php`).
    - **Form Submission:** Attackers manipulate form fields (`pseudo`, `passe` and configuration fields) to inject malicious code.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - **Network Access:** Attackers must be able to access the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
    - **Basic knowledge of SQL injection and PHP code:** Required to craft the malicious payloads.
    - **Magic Quotes Disabled:** The `magic_quotes_gpc` PHP configuration setting must be turned off for the SQL injection and code injection to succeed.
    - **Admin Access (for code execution):** Requires gaining admin access through the SQL injection vulnerability before code execution can be performed.
