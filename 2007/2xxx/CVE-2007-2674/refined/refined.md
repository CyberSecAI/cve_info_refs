```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient input validation in the 'prodid' parameter within the 'detail.php' file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can bypass authentication and retrieve sensitive information from the database, including potentially admin credentials.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP GET request to the 'detail.php' file with a malicious 'prodid' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
