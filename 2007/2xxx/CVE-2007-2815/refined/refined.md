{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The 'Hit-highlighting' functionality in Microsoft IIS 5, specifically the null.htw object, allows bypassing authentication when accessed from a non-existent directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Authentication bypass",
      "Vulnerability in the Hit-highlighting functionality"
     ],
    "impact": "Attackers can gain access to protected documents and ASP code. In trusted zones, attackers could potentially execute commands.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the null.htw object with a CiWebhitsfile parameter pointing to a protected file, when accessed from a non-existant directory.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need prior authentication, and can be a remote user."
  },
  "additional_details": {
   "affected_systems": "Microsoft Internet Information Services Version 5, any Service Pack.",
   "poc": "https://anyiis5.com/authBypass/null.htw?CiWebhitsfile=/protectedfile.aspx&CiRestriction=b&CiHiliteType=full\nhttps://anyiis5.com/authBypass/null.htw?CiWebhitsfile=/some/secretfile.txt&CiRestriction=b&CiHiliteType=full",
    "solution": "Protect the files from the NTFS filesystem instead of relying on the IIS protection. Microsoft recommends not to use IISv5 and update to IISv6."
