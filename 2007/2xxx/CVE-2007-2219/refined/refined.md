{
  "CVE-2007-2219": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the Win32 API validates parameters. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user viewed the Web page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.",
    "Root cause": "The Win32 API does not correctly validate parameters passed to it in a function call.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of function parameters by Win32 API"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution, complete control of the affected system, allowing the attacker to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted web pages that exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer.",
       "HTML documents such as web pages, HTML email messages, or attachments."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to host a malicious web page or send a specially crafted HTML document and convince a user to view it using a vulnerable application such as Internet Explorer or Outlook Express.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability can be triggered by simply viewing a specially crafted HTML document. The vulnerability was reported by Billy Rios of Verisign. The Win32 API provides services used by all Windows-based applications. It allows an application to interact with the operating system."
