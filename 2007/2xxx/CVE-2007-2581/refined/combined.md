How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Vulnerability Information

## Severity Ratings and Vulnerability Identifiers

| Affected Software | SharePoint Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2581 | Aggregate Severity Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 | Elevation of Privilege | Important |
| Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 | Elevation of Privilege | Important |

## SharePoint Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2581

This is a scripting vulnerability in Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to run arbitrary script that can result in elevation of privilege within the SharePoint site, as opposed to elevation of privilege within the workstation or server environment. The vulnerability could also allow an attacker to run arbitrary script to modify a userâs cache, resulting in information disclosure at the workstation. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-2581](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2007-2581).

#### Mitigating Factors for SharePoint Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2581

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content, or compromised Web sites and advertisement servers could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that contains a specially-crafted URL with embedded Javascript.
* In the information disclosure scenario, clients that have the advanced Internet option, **Do not save encrypted pages to disk**, turned on in Internet Explorer would not be at risk from any attempts to put spoofed content into the client cache if the clients accessed SharePoint site through the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.

#### Workarounds for SharePoint Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2581

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for SharePoint Scripting Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2581

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a scripting vulnerability in Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to run arbitrary script that can result in elevation of privilege within the SharePoint site, as opposed to elevation of privilege within the workstation or server environment. The vulnerability could also allow an attacker to run arbitrary script to modify a userâs cache, resulting in information disclosure at the workstation. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Both Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 do not sufficiently validate URL-encoded requests to ensure that the requests do not contain script code.

**What are SharePoint Services?**

Windows SharePoint Services, a technology in Windows Server 2003, provides a platform for collaboration applications, offering a common framework for document management and a common repository for storing documents of all types. It exposes key Windows Server services like Windows Workflow Services and Windows Rights Management Services. Office SharePoint Server 2007 is an integrated suite of server capabilities built on top of Windows SharePoint Services.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights on the SharePoint site as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the SharePoint site could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights on the SharePoint site.

An attacker could also run arbitrary script to modify a userâs cache by displaying spoofed responses to users, or by redirecting server responses to the attacker. This results in information disclosure at the workstation.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In the elevation of privilege scenario, an attacker could convince a user to click a specially crafted link, in an e-mail message or in a Web site, that contained script. Once the user clicks the link, the browser would run the script to elevate the attacker to the same privilege or higher as the logged-on user on the SharePoint site.

In the spoofing scenario, an attacker could also create a specially crafted link to redirect the user to another specially crafted Web site, or to capture confidential information within the browser cache.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems that are running Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 are primarily at risk of attacks resulting in elevation of privilege. Workstations where users are accessing a vulnerable SharePoint site are at risk of attacks resulting in information disclosure.

**What does the update do?**

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 validate URL-encoded requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number[CVE-2007-2581](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2007-2581).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.

To install the required version of Windows Installer, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

* [Windows Installer 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang;=en) Redistributable

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?** or **/help** | Displays usage dialog. |
| **/passive** | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel. |
| **/quiet** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted. |
| **/norestart** | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart. |
| **/forcerestart** | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |
| **/extract** | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 (all editions)

**Reference Table**
