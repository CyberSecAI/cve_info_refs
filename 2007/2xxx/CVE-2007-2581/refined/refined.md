Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2007-2581:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of URL-encoded requests within Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007. These applications fail to properly sanitize URL requests, allowing for the inclusion of script code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation of URL-encoded requests.
- Failure to sanitize or block script code within URLs.
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability leading to potential privilege escalation.
- Potential for information disclosure through modification of user cache.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker can execute arbitrary script within the context of the SharePoint site. This could allow the attacker to gain privileges equal to or higher than the logged-on user within the SharePoint environment.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can inject script to modify a user's cache, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information stored at the workstation. This can be achieved by displaying spoofed responses or redirecting server responses.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web-based Attack:** Attackers can host specially crafted URLs containing script on websites or compromise existing ones.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers must convince users to click a malicious link embedded in emails or instant messages.
- **Spoofed Redirects:** An attacker can craft links to redirect users to another malicious site or capture data within the browser cache.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft malicious URLs containing script.
- Ability to host the crafted URLs on a website or send them via email or IM.
- Ability to persuade users to interact with the malicious link.
