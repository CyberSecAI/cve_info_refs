Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2521

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `common.php` script of E-GADS! version 2.2.6.  The script includes a file based on a user-supplied parameter named `locale` without proper sanitization. Specifically, the vulnerable code is:
```php
require ("$locale/locale.php");
```
This allows for the injection of a URL that points to an attacker-controlled file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The core vulnerability is RFI, where an attacker can include a remote file, which is under the attackerâ€™s control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, data theft, or further attacks on other systems.
- **Website Defacement:**  The attacker can use a malicious script to modify the content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request, by manipulating the `locale` parameter in the URL.
- The vulnerable parameter `locale` is passed via the URL.
- Example attack URL provided: `http://site.com/path/common.php?locale=[[Sh3LL Script]]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Ability to Host a Malicious Script:** The attacker needs a server to host the malicious PHP file they wish to include on the vulnerable server.
- The attacker has to control an accessible server hosting malicious code.
- The attacker doesn't need authentication.
