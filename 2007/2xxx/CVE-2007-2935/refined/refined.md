    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-2935",
      "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied data passed to shell_exec.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote Code Execution",
        "Command Injection"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to spellcheck.php with a crafted 'dict' parameter"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable spellcheck.php file. The attacker does not require authentication.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper sanitization of the 'dict' POST parameter in the spellcheck.php script. This parameter is used in a call to the shell_exec function, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands. The exploit demonstrates two methods: the first inserts a malicious PHP file in a temporary directory and then runs it, the second injects and executes commands directly. The vulnerability is also exploitable when register globals = off."
