# Courier-IMAP: Remote execution of arbitrary code — GLSA **200704-18**

A vulnerability has been discovered in Courier-IMAP allowing for remote
code execution with root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-mail/courier-imap** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.0.6-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.0.6-r2**< **4.0.0** |

### Background

Courier-IMAP is an IMAP server which is part of the Courier mail
system. It provides access only to maildirs.

### Description

CJ Kucera has discovered that some Courier-IMAP scripts don't properly
handle the XMAILDIR variable, allowing for shell command injection.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted login credentials to a
Courier-IMAP server instance, possibly leading to remote code execution
with root privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Courier-IMAP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/courier-imap-4.0.6-r2"
```
### References

| [Description](#c0)  CJ Kucera    2007-02-23 23:48:05 UTC  ``` /usr/lib/courier-imap/courier-imapd.indirect and /usr/lib/courier-imap/courier-pop3d.indirect do not protect the variable ${XMAILDIR} and could lead to remote command execution.  For instance, we have a user on our system with a username like "user&name" (the ampersand character is, regrettably, valid in email addresses, per the RFC), and the user's maildir expands to /var/spool/mail/domain.com/user&name.  Upon logging in via IMAP or POP, we received the following in our logs: pop3d: /usr/lib/courier-imap/courier-pop3d.indirect: line 3: name: command not found pop3d: chdir /var/spool/mail/domain.com/user: No such file or directory  As you can see, the "&" was able to background the process, and then it tried to run the command "name."  Now, it does look like there would have to be malicious code in our users' maildir settings in order for this to be actually exploited, but it's still far from ideal, and required patching in our case for our five users with ampersands, since they wouldn't be able to log in otherwise.  I've changed my local copies of these two scripts to quote quote ${XMAILDIR}, and use "exec" instead of "eval," because that will enforce the argument list properly.  That seems to work fine for us.  I'm also curious as to why the script is there to begin with.  The Courier docs (specifically <http://www.courier-mta.org/?download.php~imap> ) seem to suggest just using courierpop3d directly, without an "indirect" script inbetween.  Ideally I'd like to do without a bash inbetween.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Robin Johnson   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2007-02-24 10:21:45 UTC  ``` XMAILDIR should be quoted yes. the point of the indirect script is the 'LOGINRUN' variable and specifically evaluating it. This makes it possible to nicely do things like SMTP-after-POP/IMAP, by configuring something into the LOGINRUN variable. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-02-26 23:19:53 UTC  ``` yeah indeed, that's not a nice shell script :(( ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-03-09 21:50:00 UTC  ``` Hi Robin, i don't know why you weren't CCed, sorry ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-03-15 21:49:20 UTC  ``` CCing herd, please advise ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Luca Longinotti (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-07 01:43:31 UTC  ``` This is fixed in the new revisions of courier-imap, 4.0.6-r2 and 4.1.2-r1.

A recent upgrade of Courier on our systems have uncovered this again - it's the same issue.  The $XMAILDIR variable *is* quoted properly now, but the "eval" statement ends up working against the quotes.  In order for this to work properly, "exec" has to be used instead, because then each argument gets passed properly, instead of concatenating the string and calling it that way.  From the bash manpage on the "eval" function: > The args are read and concatenated together into a single command  The bit of bash's manpage which deals with the "exec" function doesn't explicitly state that the arguments are handled properly, but it's clearly just calling exec(3) behind the scenes, which will Do The Right Thing in this case.  So, again, just to clarify - the files courier-imapd.indirect and courier-pop3d.indirect are still not handling "&" in usernames correctly, because eval is being used instead of exec.  I know that this is definitely a corner case here, and that it'd be mightily difficult to actually exploit this on a live system, but it should still probably be Done The Right Way.  Thanks!  -CJ ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-08 00:57:15 UTC  ``` net-mail, please advise. ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-17 18:58:34 UTC  ``` Any news on this one? ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-06 19:28:34 UTC  ``` net-mail, please provide an updated ebuild. ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-01-20 10:57:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=168196#c20)) > net-mail, please provide an updated ebuild. >   *ping* ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Jakub Moc (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2008-02-03 11:06:44 UTC  ``` Shall this get masked, or WTH?!

The following happens for a remote compromise: 1) imaplogin gets called and the attacker tries to authenticate against the server 2) attacker guesses vulnerable username containing '&' AND users password 3) imaplogin calls auth_login, which calls imaplogin's login_callback() 4) login_callback() calls courier-authlib's login_callback_default(), which drops privileges to the logged in user's and changes to his home 5) login_callback() executes our imapd script 3) attacker gets to execute a local user chosen command with the rights of the user logged in (may even be a special vmail user, as with my installation)  So this is NOT a remote root compromise. You need special information and a very specific setup for this to actually pose a threat.  To clarify: if i have a user who sets MAILDIR="/home/user/.maildir&#!/bin/bash\nupload_and_install_my_rootkit()" every login by that user will execute upload_and_install_my_rootkit() with the rights of that user. BUT if your user can set his own MAILDIR, he might as well execute that function himself.  On my system MAILDIR is set by a query to a root controlled mysql table. So the values there are safe, even if the script won't handle '&' properly, and might even execute a command by accident.  I apologize for not doing that analysis beforehand and rushing the change in under the flag of security.  I'll reset the glsa tag to the last known good state for now, this is not a security issue in my eyes. Feel free to reopen if you think otherwise. ``` |  |
