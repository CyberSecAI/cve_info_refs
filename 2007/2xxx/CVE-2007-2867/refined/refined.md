  "CVE-2007-2867": {
    "description": "The Mozilla layout engine contains multiple vulnerabilities that may lead to memory corruption. These vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to execute code or cause a denial-of-service condition. According to Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-12, some of these crashes showed evidence of memory corruption under certain circumstances and could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "Integer overflow and insufficient bounds checking in the `_cairo_pen_init` function within the SVG rendering module.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Integer Overflow",
          "Insufficient Bounds Checking",
          "Memory Corruption"
        ],
        "impact": "Remote code execution or denial of service.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "By crafting a malicious SVG file or embedding malicious SVG code into a web page, an attacker could trigger the vulnerability through the browser's rendering engine."
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "Ability to create or control a malicious SVG file or web page.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs because the pen->num_vertices value can be a large number or a negative number due to a signed integer type, which then passes the size check and causes issues in memory allocation. Specifically, a signed integer type is used for the pen->num_vertices value, and a check `if (pen->num_vertices > 0xffff)` is used which does not address the possibility of pen->num_vertices being a negative number."
      },
      {
          "root_cause": "Reflow occurring during an update of quote/counter lists, leading to dangling pointers.",
          "weaknesses": [
              "Dangling Pointers",
              "Race Condition"
          ],
          "impact": "Heap corruption, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.",
           "attack_vectors": [
            "Triggering a reflow flush during an update of quote/counter lists, for example by accessing document.body.offsetWidth in a mutation event handler."
          ],
          "required_capabilities": "Ability to cause reflows during layout changes.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability is caused by reflows which can happen mid-update causing issues with the quote/counter lists. This allows the lists to have dangling pointers.  A patch was created to prevent this issue."
      },
       {
          "root_cause": "Incorrect calculations of row heights in `nsTableRowGroupFrame::CalculateRowHeights`, leading to heap corruption.",
          "weaknesses": [
              "Array Out-of-Bounds Write",
               "Heap Corruption"
          ],
          "impact": "Heap corruption, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
           "attack_vectors": [
            "By constructing a specially crafted HTML table that triggers the incorrect height calculations, an attacker could cause heap corruption."
           ],
          "required_capabilities": "Ability to create or control a malicious HTML document with specific table layouts.",
          "additional_details": "An out-of-bounds write was occuring because the code didn't check if rowIndex + rowSpan was within numRows. The code was modified to make sure that that condition is always true."
