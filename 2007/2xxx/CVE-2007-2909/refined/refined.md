The provided content discusses the release of vBulletin 3.6.7, which addresses an XSS vulnerability present in prior versions of vBulletin 3.6 (specifically prior to 3.6.7, but not affecting 3.5.x or 3.0.x).

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An XSS flaw was identified in vBulletin 3.6 versions prior to 3.6.7. The specific location/code of the XSS is not provided, but it is noted that further patches and plugins were released to address additional XSS issues found later.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The content doesn't specify the exact impact, but XSS vulnerabilities can be used to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is not specified in detail, but it is through the exploitation of an XSS vulnerability in the vBulletin software. The content implies user interaction is involved.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script that will be executed when a user visits a vulnerable part of the forum. This usually involves finding a way to inject unsanitized data, such as forum posts, user profiles or other user-contributed content, so that the data will render as HTML containing the malicious script.
