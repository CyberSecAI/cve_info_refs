{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The `parser_path` parameter in the `xls2mysql` script is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include a remote file containing malicious code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious script from a remote location.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker provides a URL to a malicious script using the `parser_path` parameter in the `xls2mysql` script.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs a publicly accessible malicious script and the ability to craft a URL with the malicious script's path in the `parser_path` parameter. No authentication is required."
  },
  "exploit_details": {
      "exploit_code": "The provided Perl script takes three arguments: the target URL, the URL of the command execution shell, and the variable to pass commands through. It exploits the RFI vulnerability by including the remote shell and then executes commands using this shell.",
      "usage": "perl exploit.pl <target_url> <cmd_shell_url> <cmd_variable> , where target_url is the location of the vulnerable script (ABC Excel Parser), cmd_shell_url is the location of the attacker's command execution shell, and cmd_variable is the variable used to pass the command in the cmd shell."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The content provides a detailed explanation of how to exploit the vulnerability including a Perl script, which can be used to perform remote command execution. The CVSS score is 7.5, with an exploitability subscore of 10, which indicates this vulnerability is easily exploitable."
