- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack buffer overflow in the `DeleteProfile` method of the `hpqvwocx.dll` ActiveX control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application using the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a malicious web page exploiting the ActiveX control, specifically by calling the `DeleteProfile` method with an overly long string as an argument.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to entice a user to visit a malicious webpage containing the exploit, causing the ActiveX control to be loaded and the overflow triggered.
