    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by sending a malformed SIP message containing \\377 characters.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The device's SIP stack does not handle the \\377 character correctly, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "The device becomes unresponsive and may need to be rebooted. In one exploit, the device is rebooted due to the malformed SIP packet.",
      "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted UDP packet to the target's SIP port.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the target device's IP address and SIP port."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted SIP INVITE message with a \\377 character in the 'From:' header field.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present":"The device's SIP processing logic fails to handle the malformed 'From:' header, causing a denial-of-service.",
