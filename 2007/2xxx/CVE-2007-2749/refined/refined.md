Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `question.php` file of FAQEngine versions 4.16.03 and earlier.
*   The `questionref` parameter in the `question.php` script is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, which allows the attacker to manipulate database queries. The vulnerable code is:
    ```sql
    $sql = "select * from ".$tableprefix."_questions where publish=1 and questionref=$questionref order by enterdate desc";
    ```

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as admin usernames and password hashes.
*   **Complete compromise:** By dumping sensitive information, an attacker can potentially obtain valid credentials and fully compromise the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `question.php` script, by manipulating the value of the `questionref` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable FAQEngine instance.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests to craft the malicious URL.
*   **SQL injection knowledge:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of SQL syntax to construct a working exploit.

**Exploit Details**

*   The exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract usernames and passwords from the `faq_admins` table.
*   The PoC provided in the exploit script demonstrates how to extract the admin username and hash:
    ```
    question.php?mode=display&questionref=-999 UNION SELECT 0,0,0,0,username,password,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 FROM faq_admins WHERE usernr=1 /*
    ```
*   The exploit script automates this process, retrieving the username and hash.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit script provided in the Exploit-DB entry uses Perl and includes a User-Agent header.
*   The exploit specifically targets the `usernr=1` which is the first admin user in the table.
*   The vulnerability is conditional on the `question display mode` being enabled in the application.
