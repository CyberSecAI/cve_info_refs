  "CVE-2007-2509": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the PHP 'ftp' extension. If a PHP script used this extension to provide access to a private FTP server, and passed untrusted script input directly to any function provided by this extension, a remote attacker would be able to send arbitrary FTP commands to the server.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `ftp_putcmd()` function in PHP does not properly sanitize the input, leading to CRLF injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Input Sanitization",
        "CRLF Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can send arbitrary FTP commands to the server, potentially allowing for unauthorized file manipulation or data exfiltration.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network",
        "Remote"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request that passes untrusted input to the vulnerable PHP `ftp_putcmd()` function within a PHP script that is used to connect to a private FTP server. The attacker requires some level of access to the affected web application"
