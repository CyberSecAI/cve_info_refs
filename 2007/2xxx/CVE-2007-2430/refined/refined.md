Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `SessionUserLang` cookie value before it's used to construct a filename for a cache file.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Code Injection: The `SessionUserLang` cookie is used to define the `$language` variable, which is then incorporated into the filename of a cache file. By injecting newline characters and PHP code into this cookie, an attacker can create a malicious PHP file on the server.
- Unsanitized input: The code does not properly sanitize the user-controlled input before using it in a file path and when writing to the file system.
- Predictable file path: the location where the malicious file is placed is predictable: /cache folder of the application.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary code execution: By including PHP code in the crafted filename/cache file and then accessing it, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- Full server compromise: As a consequence of code execution, the attacker can gain control of the affected web server and the resources on the server.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP Cookie Manipulation: The attacker injects malicious code via the `SessionUserLang` cookie in an HTTP request.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application. No other special privileges or access is required.
