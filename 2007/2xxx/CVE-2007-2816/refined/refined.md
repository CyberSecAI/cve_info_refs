      "source": "www.attrition.org_9212702c_20250125_072511.html",
       "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the use of an include statement that incorporates user supplied data from the root parameter.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Unvalidated user input used in include statements.",

        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the 'root' parameter in the URL. The web server must allow remote file inclusion for the attack to be successful."
