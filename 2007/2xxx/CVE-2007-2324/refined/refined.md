{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `file.php` script in JulmaCMS 1.4 does not properly sanitize the `file` parameter passed through the GET method, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization of the 'file' parameter.",
      "Direct use of user-supplied input to construct a file path."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially disclosing sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or system files (e.g., /etc/passwd).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request with a manipulated 'file' parameter.",
        "Path traversal using '..' sequences to navigate to directories outside the intended path."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable JulmaCMS installation.",
        "additional_notes": "The provided exploit example shows how to read the '/etc/passwd' file by sending a GET request to `file.php?file=../../../../../../etc/passwd`."
