2. What's New
========================================================================
An unchecked buffer in the ServerProtect module "AgRpcCln.dll" can
overflow and allow attackers to run arbitrary code. An attacker can
exploit this vulnerability remotely using RPC and can use it to run
code with system account privileges.
This release patches this vulnerability.
3. Documentation Set

4. System Requirements
========================================================================
No special requirements for installing this security patch.
5. Installation
========================================================================
To install this security patch:
1. Copy the file "spnt\_558\_win\_en\_securitypatch3.exe" to a temporary
folder on the ServerProtect Information Server.
2. Ensure that the ServerProtect Management Console is not running.
3. Open "spnt\_558\_win\_en\_securitypatch3.exe" and follow the
instructions to install the patch. The Information Server will
deploy the patch to NT Normal Servers 30 seconds after installation
is complete, and then it will restart ServerProtect services.
Note: If the installation does not complete successfully, review the
file "TMPatch.log" in the system root folder before contacting
technical support.
To roll back to the previous build:
1.) Before you can roll back, run the following shell commands to stop
all ServerProtect services:
net stop spntsvc
net stop earthagent
net stop "TrendMicro Infrastructure"
2.) You can find the backup files with extension name "bak" in the
ServerProtect home directory. To roll back, just rename the backup
files and use them to replace the current files.
3.) After the rollback, run the following commands to start
ServerProtect services:
net start spntsvc
net start earthagent
net start "TrendMicro Infrastructure"
6. Post-installation Configuration
========================================================================
No post-installation configuration needed for this patch.
Note: Trend Micro recommends that you update your scan engine and
virus pattern files immediately after installing this patch.
