Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2424:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability present in "The Merchant" version 2.2.0.
*   The `index.php` script is vulnerable because it uses user-supplied input via the `show` parameter without proper sanitization, which allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes files based on user input without validating if it's a local or remote path, thus enabling remote file inclusion.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `show` parameter is not sanitized, allowing the attacker to provide a URL pointing to malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include a malicious PHP file hosted on a remote server. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application, effectively taking control of the system.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a full compromise of the vulnerable server, including access to sensitive data and the ability to perform further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request, including the `show` parameter to specify the URL of the malicious file.
*   The vulnerable `index.php` script is accessed with the parameter show set to the location of the attacker's malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and host the malicious script on a web server accessible by the vulnerable server.
*   **Basic Knowledge of Web Application Exploitation:** The attacker must understand how RFI vulnerabilities work and how to craft HTTP requests to exploit them.

**Additional Details**

*   The exploit is demonstrated with an HTML form that allows a user to input the target URL and the malicious script URL.
*   The exploit uses the vulnerable `index.php` with the `show` parameter to include the remote file.
*   The provided exploit suggests the attacker has the ability to host a malicious PHP script that could be included via the RFI vulnerability.
*   The Exploit-DB entry provides a direct link to the CVE information at NVD.
*   The exploit also contains the author information and the vulnerable application details along with a link to the source of the application.
