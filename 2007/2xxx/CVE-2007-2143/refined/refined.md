```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Joomla! Template Be2004-2 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in the index.php file due to the insecure use of the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server.
- Attack vectors: By crafting a URL with the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter pointing to a malicious file hosted on a remote server.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have access to a server where they can host a malicious file.
