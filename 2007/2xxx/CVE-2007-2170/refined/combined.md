Additional information will be added soon.    With this CPU Oracle has fixed 36 security bugs in various Oracle products and components. The oldest bug which is fixed in this CPU is from 2003. It is necessary to apply this CPU on every Oracle Client installation to avoid the DB11.  The Oracle database patches are fixing 13 security bugs. The most critical security bug for Windows databases is DB01 which allows remote exploitation without usercredentials. The CVSS rating for this bug is 7.0. For Unix and Windows users one critical bug (DB05) is related to the database logon trigger mechanism. It's possible to bypass database logon trigger if the CPU April 2007 is not applied.   Keep in mind that there are no patches for Oracle XE for Windows. The remote exploitable bug (DB01) is and will be unfixed in XE (like many other critical issues). Oracle is not planning to release patches for XE.   Oracle fixes also 2 new security problems in the Oracle Enterprise Manager, 1 in Oracle Workflow Cartridge and 1 in the Ultrasearch.  Fixed security vulnerabilities in Oracle PL/SQL-Packages:  | Package | Function/Procedure | Granted to | Vulnerability/ Change | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | N/A |  |  | DB01 | | N/A |  |  | DB02 | | N/A |  |  | DB03 | | SYS.DBMS\_AQADM\_SYS |  |  | DB04 | | N/A |  |  | DB05 | | SYS.DBMS\_APPLY\_USER\_AGENT |  |  | DB06 | | SYS.DBMS\_UPGRADE\_INTERNAL |  |  | DB07 | | SYS.DBMS\_CDC\_IPUBLISH |  |  | DB08 | | SYS.DBMS\_CDC\_PUBLISH |  |  | DB09 | | SYS.DBMS\_SNAP\_INTERNAL |  |  | DB10 | | N/A |  |  | DB11 | | N/A |  |  | DB12 | | N/A |  |  | DB13 |      The following table contains a mapping of Oracle vuln to the CVE numbers.   | Oracle Vuln | CVE# | Vulnerability-Type | | --- | --- | --- | | [DB01](http://www.ngssoftware.com/papers/database-on-xp.pdf) | [CVE-2007-2108](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2108) | Authentication Bypass via Windows Share | | DB02 | [CVE-2007-2109](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2109) | Race Condition | | [DB03](http://www.freelists.org/archives/oracle-l/12-2006/msg00004.html) | [CVE-2007-2110](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2110) | Null DACL on Oracle Process | | [DB04](http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/oracle_sql_injection_dbms_aqadm_sys.html) | [CVE-2007-2111](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2111) | SQL Injection | | [DB05](http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/bypass_oracle_logon_trigger.html) | [CVE-2007-2112](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2112) | Bypass Logon Trigger | | DB06 | [CVE-2007-2109](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2109) | SQL Injection | | [DB07](http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/oracle_sql_injection_dbms_upgrade_internal.html) | [CVE-2007-2113](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2113) | SQL Injection | | DB08 |  | Buffer Overflow | | [DB09](http://www.databasesecurity.com/oracle/OracleOct2006-CPU-Analysis.pdf) | [CVE-2007-2115](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2115) | SQL Injection | | DB10 | [CVE-2007-2116](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2116) | Buffer Overflow | | DB11 | [CVE-2007-2114](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2114) | Local Buffer Overflow | | DB12 | [CVE-2007-2117](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2117) | Local Buffer Overflow | | DB13 | [CVE-2007-2118](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2118) | Local Buffer Overflow |  Oracle Application Server / APPS /Peoplesoft  | Oracle Vuln | CVE# | Vulnerability-Type | | --- | --- | --- | | OWF01 | [CVE-2007-2130](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2130) |  | | [SES01](http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/oracle_css_ses.html) | [CVE-2007-2119](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2119) | XSS | | EM01 | [CVE-2007-2129](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2129) |  | | [AS01](http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/oracle_discoverer_servlet.html) | [CVE-2007-2120](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2120) | Denial of Service | | AS02 | [CVE-2007-2121](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2121) |  | | AS03 | [CVE-2007-2122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2122) |  | | AS04 | [CVE-2007-2123](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2123) |  | | AS05 | [CVE-2007-2124](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2124) |  | | OCS01 | [CVE-2007-2125](%20http%3A//cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2125) |  | | APPS01 | [CVE-2007-2126](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2126) |  | | APPS02 | [CVE-2007-2126](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2126) |  | | APPS03 |  |  | | APPS04 | [CVE-2007-2127](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2127) |  | | APPS05 | [CVE-2007-2127](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2127) |  | | APPS06 | [CVE-2007-2127](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2127) |  | | APPS07 | [CVE-2007-2127](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2127) |  | | APPS08 | [CVE-2007-2128](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2128) |  | | APPS09 | [CVE-2007-2127](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2127) |  | | APPS10 | [CVE-2007-2127](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2127) |  | | PSE01 | [CVE-2007-2131](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2131) |  | | PSE02 | [CVE-2007-2132](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2132) |  | | PSEHCM01 | [CVE-2007-2133](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2133) |  | | JDE01 | [CVE-2007-2134](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2134) |  |     sReferences  * [Oracle -

ZDI-07-016: Oracle E-Business Suite Arbitrary Node Deletion
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-07-016.html
April 18, 2007
-- CVE ID:
CVE-2007-2170
-- Affected Vendor:
Oracle
-- Affected Products:
Oracle E-Business Suite
-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability since December 14, 2006 by Digital Vaccine protection
filter ID 4919. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS:
http://www.tippingpoint.com
-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to delete any existing
Document Management node on vulnerable installations of Oracle
E-Business Suite. Authentication is not required to exploit this
vulnerability.
The specific flaw exists in the APPLSYS.FND\_DM\_NODES package. The
procedure to delete nodes does not check for a valid session thereby
allowing an attacker to arbitrarily delete any node registered,
including the root node.
-- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/
cpuapr2007.html
-- Disclosure Timeline:
2007.01.29 - Vulnerability reported to vendor
2006.12.14 - Digital Vaccine released to TippingPoint customers
2007.04.18 - Coordinated public release of advisory
-- Credit:
This vulnerability was discovered by Joxean Koret.
-- About the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI):
Established by TippingPoint, a division of 3Com, The Zero Day Initiative
(ZDI) represents a best-of-breed model for rewarding security
researchers for responsibly disclosing discovered vulnerabilities.
Researchers interested in getting paid for their security research
through the ZDI can find more information and sign-up at:
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com
The ZDI is unique in how the acquired vulnerability information is used.
3Com does not re-sell the vulnerability details or any exploit code.
Instead, upon notifying the affected product vendor, 3Com provides its
customers with zero day protection through its intrusion prevention
technology. Explicit details regarding the specifics of the
vulnerability are not exposed to any parties until an official vendor
patch is publicly available. Furthermore, with the altruistic aim of
helping to secure a broader user base, 3Com provides this vulnerability
information confidentially to security vendors (including competitors)
who have a vulnerability protection or mitigation product.
