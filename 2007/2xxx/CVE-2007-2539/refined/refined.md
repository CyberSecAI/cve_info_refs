{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `show_queries` function in `/class/debug/debug.php` does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `executed_queries` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This parameter is obtained from the `$_POST` variable, unserialized after being URL decoded and then directly embedded into the `EXPLAIN` SQL statement within a loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Lack of Input Sanitization",
      "Unauthenticated Access"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database. This can lead to disclosure of sensitive information, modification of data, or potentially full database takeover. The provided exploit extracts the admin username and password hash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to `/class/debug/debug_show.php`",
      "Manipulating the `executed_queries` POST parameter"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server and must know or guess the path to the `debug_show.php` file within the RunCms installation. No authentication is needed.",
    "additional_info": "The exploit provided also demonstrates how to use this vulnerability to extract the administrator's username and password hash by crafting specific SQL queries. Additionally, the 'show_files' function within the same file is noted to be exploitable as well, allowing an attacker to check for file existence and retrieve file sizes or modification times."
