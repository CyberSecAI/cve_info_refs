Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) weakness in StoreFront for Gallery. Specifically, the `GALLERY_BASEDIR` parameter is vulnerable to manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows an attacker to include remote files through the `GALLERY_BASEDIR` parameter, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.

**Attack Vectors:**
