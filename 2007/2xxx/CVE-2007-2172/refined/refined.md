  "CVE-2007-2172": {
    "description": "The Linux kernel is prone to an out-of-bounds-access vulnerability. This issue occurs because the semantics for IPv4 Forwarding Information Base fail to adequately bounds-check user-supplied data before accessing an array.  An attacker can exploit this issue to cause denial-of-service conditions. Arbitrary code execution may also be possible, but this has not been confirmed. Thomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets, potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash). A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler. A flaw in the IPv4 forwarding base that allowed a local user to cause an out-of-bounds access. A typo which caused fib_props[] to have the wrong size and makes sure the value used to index the array which is provided by userspace via netlink is checked to avoid out of bound access.",
    "vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds access due to insufficient bounds checking on user-supplied data when accessing an array, and a typo in the array size definition, and incorrect array bounds check, when handling network packets.",
    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash), potential memory corruption or privilege escalation and execution of arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vector": "Sending crafted packets over a netlink socket, or by exploiting the IPv4 forwarding base.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user or remote attacker (specific for SCTP)",
    "root_cause": "Typo in array size definition and insufficient bounds check of user provided input when indexing array"
