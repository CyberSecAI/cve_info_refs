{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses a user-supplied value in the `lang2` parameter to include a language file, without proper sanitization, which allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's file system by manipulating the `lang2` parameter, potentially exposing sensitive information, such as credentials, configuration files, or source code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `galeria.php` script with a manipulated `lang2` parameter."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must be able to access the file on the local file system. "
