**CVE-2007-2453**
*   **Root Cause:** A flaw in the Linux kernel's random number generator (RNG). The system was hashing a subset of the available entropy, leading to less random numbers. Additionally, systems lacking a real-time clock (RTC), harddrive activity, or user input during boot were seeded with the same inputs at boot time, resulting in predictable output from the RNG.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary issue was insufficient entropy mixing in the RNG and the use of static seeds on systems lacking entropy sources. This resulted in a predictable output of the RNG, especially on systems without an RTC or early user input.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The vulnerability would not allow for arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation. The main impact was the lack of sufficient randomness from the RNG, which could compromise the security of cryptographic operations relying on the RNG. In the case of systems with no entropy source (no keyboard, mouse, disk drives, or real-time clock) successive boots could generate the same output.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Local access is required to obtain the output from `/dev/random` or `/dev/urandom`.
    *   No user interaction is required for the generation of predictable output if the system lacks a source of entropy.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
