Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2007-2119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the `boundary_rules.jsp` file of Oracle Secure Enterprise Search (SES).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `EXPTYPE` parameter within `boundary_rules.jsp` does not properly sanitize user-supplied input.
- This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser session.
- This can lead to various attacks, such as:
    - Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Potentially other malicious activities depending on what the application allows

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is performed through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript within the `EXPTYPE` parameter.
- The attacker needs to entice the victim to click the specially crafted link which points to a vulnerable page in Oracle SES
- The provided exploit URL is: `http://www.red-database-security.com:7777/search/admin/sources/boundary_rules.jsp?event=deleteIncludeRule&p_src=web&p_mode=edit&p_id=3&pattern=www.red-database-security.com&expType=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3ECC_SIMPLE_INCLUSION`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker would need to trick a victim into clicking this URL while being logged into the vulnerable Oracle SES application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Oracle Secure Enterprise Search versions prior to 10.1.8.
- A patch is available in the Oracle Critical Patch Update (CPU) from April 2007.
