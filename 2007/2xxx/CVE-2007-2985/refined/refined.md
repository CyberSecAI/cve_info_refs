Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2985

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the inadequate authentication mechanism used by Pheap 2.0. The application relies solely on a cookie named `pheap_login` to verify user identity. The value of this cookie is directly compared with the username stored in the `lib/config.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** If an attacker knows the admin's username, they can set the `pheap_login` cookie to that username, effectively bypassing the login page and gaining access to any page protected by this authentication method.
- **Credentials Disclosure:** By exploiting the authentication bypass, an attacker can access the `settings.php` file, which contains administrative credentials and database credentials in clear text.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the authentication bypass, an attacker can access the `edit.php` file and inject malicious PHP code into a file (e.g., `index.php`). This code can be executed by accessing the modified file and passing commands to the injected shell using a `cmd` GET parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full compromise of the web application.
- Disclosure of sensitive information (administrative credentials, database credentials).
- Arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Ability for the attacker to potentially take complete control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP requests with a crafted `pheap_login` cookie.
- Direct access to application files via HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Knowledge of the target application's path and the admin's username.
- Ability to send HTTP requests with custom headers.

**Additional Information:**
- The exploit-db.com content provides a PHP script that demonstrates the exploit. This script can be used to:
    - Retrieve all credentials in clear-text (option 0).
    - Execute remote code on the server (option 1).
- The script shows how to set the cookie, access protected pages (like `settings.php` and `edit.php`), inject the malicious code, and execute commands.
- The script makes use of `fsockopen` to send raw HTTP requests.
- The vulnerability relies on a very weak authentication method, making it easy to exploit.
