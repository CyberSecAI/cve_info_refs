  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `DBMS_AQADM_SYS.GRANT_TYPE_ACCESS` procedure contains a SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input in the `USER_NAME` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands within the context of the database user running this procedure. This could allow them to bypass security restrictions, gain access to sensitive data, or perform other unauthorized operations.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "By injecting malicious SQL code into the USER_NAME parameter of the `DBMS_AQADM_SYS.GRANT_TYPE_ACCESS` procedure."
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to call the `DBMS_AQADM_SYS.GRANT_TYPE_ACCESS` procedure with a crafted `USER_NAME` input."

  "affected_systems": [
    "Oracle 9.2.0.8",
    "Oracle 10.2.0.3"

  "additional_info": "This vulnerability is fixed in the Oracle CPU April 2007 patch release. The vulnerability is present in the `DBMS_AQADM_SYS.GRANT_TYPE_ACCESS` procedure, which is used for granting execute privileges on various AQ (Advanced Queuing) objects. The vulnerable code constructs SQL queries by concatenating the input `USER_NAME` parameter, which allows for SQL injection."
