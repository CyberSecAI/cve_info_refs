Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-2542:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability found in the `header.php` file of the workbench 0.11 application.
*   The `header.php` file uses a variable `$path` directly in an `include()` statement without proper sanitization: `<?include("$path/navbar.php")?>`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The lack of input validation on the `$path` variable allows an attacker to inject a URL to a remote file, which will then be included and executed by the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious script from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server and data theft, among other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `path` parameter in the URL of a GET request to `header.php`.
    *   Example: `http://site.com/path/header.php?path=[[Sh3LL Script]]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Remote Script Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a malicious script on a server that is accessible to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details**
*   The vulnerable application is workbench survival guide v0.11
