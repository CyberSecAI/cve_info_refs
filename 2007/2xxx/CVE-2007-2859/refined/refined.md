{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application uses dynamic variable evaluation using `$$var` in `includes/global.inc`, allowing an attacker to control the value of `$path_simpgb` via GET parameters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Dynamic variable evaluation (`$$var`)",
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) through a nested include.",
       "Lack of input sanitization for the variable used in the `include()` function."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include a remote file by controlling the `$path_simpgb` variable, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted GET request with the `path_simpgb` parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable web application."
