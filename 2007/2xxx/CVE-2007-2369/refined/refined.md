{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The `picture.php` script in WebSPELL versions 4.01.02 and earlier is vulnerable to file disclosure through two distinct methods.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unsanitized input in the `file` parameter allows for arbitrary file disclosure when `register_globals` is enabled.",
         "Unsanitized input in the `id` parameter allows for arbitrary file disclosure through path traversal and null byte injection when used with PHP versions prior to 4.3.0."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server hosting the vulnerable WebSPELL application. This can expose sensitive information, including configuration files, database credentials, and potentially source code.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request to `/picture.php` with a `file` parameter containing the path to a file when `register_globals` is enabled.",
         "HTTP GET request to `/picture.php` with an `id` parameter containing a path traversal string and a null byte when the PHP version is less than 4.3.0."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No prior authentication or special privileges are required. The attacker would need knowledge of the web application's file structure to target specific files.",
        "additional_notes": "The exploit-db entry provides a link to a patch for this vulnerability."
