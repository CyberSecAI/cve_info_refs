```
zlib plugin allows opening gzipped mboxes as read-only mailboxes.
However when using it, the mailbox name checks are bypassed so it's
possible to open for example "../otheruser/somefile.gz". Only valid
gzipped mbox files can be opened, and only if their name ends with
".gz".
```

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The zlib plugin in Dovecot bypasses mailbox name checks when opening gzipped mbox files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization on mailbox names.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker could potentially read email owned by other users.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious mailbox name using path traversal characters (e.g., `../`), an attacker can access arbitrary gzipped mbox files on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Dovecot server. The attacker also needs to be able to specify the mailbox name.
