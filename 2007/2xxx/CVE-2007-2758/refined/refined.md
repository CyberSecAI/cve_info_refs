The provided content is related to CVE-2007-2758.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is boundary errors in WinImage when handling long pathnames of files and directories within a FAT image.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  Stack-based buffer overflow: Occurs when constructing the full pathname of a file within a FAT image, leading to a stack buffer overflow when a user attempts to extract a file with a long pathname.
2.  Heap-based buffer overflow: Occurs when handling the full pathname of a directory within a FAT image, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow when the user attempts to traverse into a directory with an overly long name.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   Arbitrary code execution: By exploiting the stack-based buffer overflow, an attacker can execute arbitrary code when a user extracts a file.
-   Function pointer overwrite: The heap-based overflow allows an attacker to overwrite function pointers on the heap, leading to arbitrary code execution.
-   Denial of service: Both vulnerabilities can crash WinImage.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious FAT image with overly long directory names in multiple levels of sub-directories.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted FAT image.
-   The attacker needs to convince the victim to either:
    - Extract a file from the malicious FAT image using its full pathname, to trigger the stack-based overflow.
    - Open a malicious FAT image and traverse into a directory with an overly long name, to trigger the heap-based overflow.
- The attacker needs to have a knowledge of how to exploit the overflows to execute arbitrary code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides detailed steps to reproduce both vulnerabilities.
*   Proof-of-concept (POC) IMA files are available, which either execute calc.exe or crash the application, demonstrating the exploitability of these vulnerabilities.
*   The advisory details the process of notifying the vendor and the subsequent attempts to fix the issue.
*   The vulnerabilities were tested and confirmed on English WinXP SP2.
