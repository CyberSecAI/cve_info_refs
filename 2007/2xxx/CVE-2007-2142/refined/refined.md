  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application includes files based on a user-supplied parameter `PagePrefix` without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include a remote file, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The `PagePrefix` parameter in the URL is used to construct the path to include files. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can specify a malicious file to be included from a remote server."
