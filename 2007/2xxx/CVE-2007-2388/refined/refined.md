Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2388

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Apple QuickTime for Java does not properly restrict the instantiation and manipulation of Java objects. This is due to insufficient security checks within the QuickTime for Java implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Improper restriction of Java object instantiation and manipulation leading to a security bypass.
-  Failure to enforce Java applet security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application/applet.
-  Attackers can potentially access and manipulate system resources after bypassing Java security restrictions.
-  Compromise of the user's system, including potentially gaining full control.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious Java applet.
-  The attacker must convince a user to run this malicious applet, typically done by luring them to a malicious web page with a Java-enabled web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious Java applet.
-  The attacker must lure a user to visit a webpage hosting the malicious applet.
- The user must have a Java-enabled web browser and vulnerable version of QuickTime for Java.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Apple QuickTime 7.1.6.
- The CERT advisory notes that the QuickTime built-in auto-update mechanism may not detect this update on Microsoft Windows. Windows users are advised to check for updates using Apple Software Update or manually download and install the update.
- Disabling Java in the web browser can mitigate the vulnerability.
