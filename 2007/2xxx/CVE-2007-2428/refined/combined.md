**Few antiviral products inadequately detect 3proxy as Trojan.Daemonize,
Backdoor.Daemonize, etc and many detect 3proxy as a PUA (potentially unwanted program).
It may cause browser warning on download page.
3proxy is not trojan or backdoor and contains
no functionality except described in documentation. Clear explanation of this
fact is given, for example, in
[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/threats/malware-encyclopedia-description?Name=Program:Win32/TinyProxy)'s
article.**
