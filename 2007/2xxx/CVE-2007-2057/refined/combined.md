Product Name: Aircrack-ng (0.7)
Vendor: http://www.aircrack-ng.org
Date: 13 April, 2007
Author: Jonathan So < jonny [ @ ] nop-art [ dot ] net>
Advisory URL: http://www.nop-art.net/advisories/airodump-ng.txt
I. DESCRIPTION
A buffer overflow vulnerability has been found in airodump-ng, part of
the aircrack-ng package. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to
transmit specially crafted 802.11 packets to execute arbitrary code on
a remote machine running the airodump-ng tool.
II. DETAILS
Airodump-ng fails to check the size of 802.11 authentication packets
before copying into an insufficiently sized global buffer. As a result
it is possible to overwrite another global variable passed as the size
parameter to a subsequent memcpy() operation, in order to overflow a
stack buffer. Airodump-ng must be logging packets with the -w or
--write option to be vulnerable to this attack. The wireless device
must also be capturing packets in monitor mode.
This vulnerability has been successfully exploited against on an x86
Linux 2.6.20 machine running airodump-ng 0.7. Other versions and
platforms are also likely to be affected.

IV. EXPLOIT
/\*\*
\* airodump-exp.c - aircrack/airodump-ng (0.7) remote exploit
\*
\* Proof of concept exploit for a stack (and heap) based
\* overflow in airodump-ng. The vulnerability can be exploited
\* by transmitting some specially crafted 802.11 packets to
\* execute arbitrary code on any machines within range
\* that are sniffing with a vulnerable version of airodump-ng.
\*
\* This exploit requires the lorcon 802.11 packet injection
\* library, see http://802.11ninja.net for details.
\*
\* Compiling:
\*
\* gcc -o airodump-remote airodump-remote.c -lorcon
\*
\* Usage:
\*
\* ./airodump-ng <interface> <driver> <channel> <headertype> [return addr]
\*
\* Drivers supported by lorcon:
\*
\* wlan-ng, hostap, airjack, prism54, madwifing, madwifiold,
\* rtl8180, rt2570, rt2500, rt73, rt61, zd1211rw
\*
\* Header types:
\*
\* 0 - None (not tested)
\* 1 - Fake prism54 header
\* 2 - Fake radiotap header (not tested)
\*
\* Return addresses:
\*
\* Backtrack Linux 2 (2.6.20) aircrack-ng 0.7 - 0x8054934
\* Gentoo Linux (2.6.16) aircrack-ng 0.7 - 0x8055934
\*
\* Example usage:
\*
\* ./airodump-ng wlan0 prism54 11 1 0x8054934

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Airodump-ng buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#349828

Original Release Date: 2007-04-25 | Last Revised: 2007-07-17

---

### Overview

The airodump-ng program, which is a part of the aircrack-ng suite, contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. If successfully exploited, this vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute code.

### Description

| The aircrack-ng suite is a group of related programs that can be used to recover WEP and WPA-PSK keys from active 802.11 wireless networks. The aircrack-ng suite also includes programs that can inject and collect raw wireless frames, enable wireless monitor mode, and create network interfaces that can be used for wireless intrustion detection systems (IDS). [Airodump-ng](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airodump-ng) is one of the programs that is included with the aircrack-ng suite.  The airodump-ng program contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs because airodump-ng fails to properly check the size of 802.11 authentication packets. An attacker within radio range may be able to exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted 802.11 frame to a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**This issue as been addressed in the [0.9 development version](http://trac.aircrack-ng.org/wiki/Sources) of aircrack-ng. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Aircrack-ng: Remote execution of arbitrary code â€” GLSA **200704-16**

Aircrack-ng contains a buffer overflow that could lead to the remote
execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-wireless/aircrack-ng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.7-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.7-r2** |

### Background

Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can
recover keys once enough data packets have been captured.

### Description

Jonathan So reported that the airodump-ng module does not correctly
check the size of 802.11 authentication packets before copying them
into a buffer.

### Impact

A remote attacker could trigger a stack-based buffer overflow by
sending a specially crafted 802.11 authentication packet to a user
running airodump-ng with the -w (--write) option. This could lead to
the remote execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running airodump-ng, which is typically the root user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Aircrack-ng users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-wireless/aircrack-ng-0.7-r2"
```
