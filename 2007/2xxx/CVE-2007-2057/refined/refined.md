{
  "guidelines_followed": "YES",
  "CVE_ID": "CVE-2007-2057",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper size validation of 802.11 authentication packets within the airodump-ng program before copying the data into a buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Insufficient size check"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability of the targeted system.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted 802.11 authentication packets to a vulnerable system.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be within radio range of a vulnerable system running airodump-ng in monitor mode, with packet logging enabled using the `-w` or `--write` option.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because the size of the 802.11 authentication packets is not validated before being copied into a global buffer. This can lead to overwriting a global variable used as a size parameter in a subsequent memcpy(), allowing a stack buffer overflow. A proof-of-concept exploit is available. The exploit uses lorcon 802.11 packet injection library."
