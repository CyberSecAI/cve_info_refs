- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `everything.php` script in the Flip add-on includes files based on the `$incpath` variable, which is not properly sanitized, leading to Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability due to unsanitized `$incpath` variable.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can include and execute arbitrary remote code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can manipulate the `$incpath` variable to point to a malicious file hosted on a remote server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to influence the `$incpath` variable, which likely comes from user input or a configuration setting. The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious file.
