Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2733:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an email injection vulnerability in Jetbox CMS version 2.1. The specific details of how the injection occurs are not present in the provided content. 

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Email Injection vulnerability: This allows an attacker to potentially manipulate email headers and content, enabling them to send spam, phishing emails, or other malicious content.
- Multiple XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities are also present via GET requests. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application. The parameters vulnerable to XSS are: 'path', 'companyname', 'email', 'firstname', 'middlename', 'recipient', 'required', 'surname', 'text', and 'title'.
- Shell upload vulnerability: This allows an authenticated user with "authors privileges" to upload arbitrary files, including PHP scripts, which can lead to remote code execution on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Email Injection: Can lead to spam, phishing attacks, and possibly other malicious email-based activities.
- XSS: Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirect to attacker-controlled pages.
- Shell Upload: Allows for remote code execution, potentially leading to complete compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Email Injection: The attack vector is through the vulnerable email sending mechanism in Jetbox CMS 2.1.
- XSS: The attack vectors are GET requests to specific URLs with malicious javascript in the specified query parameters.
- Shell Upload: The attack vector is through the file upload function accessible to authenticated users with authors privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Email Injection: The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable email sending mechanism of the Jetbox CMS. Specific details are not included.
- XSS: The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and trick users into accessing them.
- Shell Upload: The attacker must have "authors privileges" within the Jetbox CMS.
