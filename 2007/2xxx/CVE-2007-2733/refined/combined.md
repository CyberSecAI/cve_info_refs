shell upload:
you can upload any kind of file if you have some authors privileges.
your file will be located here:
./jetbox/webfiles/yourfile.php
solution:
1) xss --> use: http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.htmlentities.php
2) upload script :
--> allow only certains extension like :
txt,mp3,zip,rar,pdf,odt,doc...etc...
