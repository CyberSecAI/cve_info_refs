{
  "CVE-2007-2881": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability in the way Sun Java System Web Proxy Server processes malformed packets may allow execution of arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in how the 'sockd' daemon, which implements SOCKS proxy support, handles specially crafted SOCKS packets. Specifically, attackers can manipulate certain bytes during protocol negotiation to cause a buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker on the local network may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SOCKS server or cause a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted SOCKS packet to the vulnerable server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the local network and capable of sending SOCKS packets."
