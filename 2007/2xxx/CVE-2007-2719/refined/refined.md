    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The HP Systems Insight Manager web application uses a JSESSIONID session cookie for maintaining a session with administrator's browser. The console is vulnerable to session fixation, allowing an attacker to obtain the session cookie and force the administrator to use it when logging into the administration console.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Session fixation vulnerability",
        "Insufficient checks on session cookies"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain administrative access to the HP SIM console, take complete control over all managed systems, upload and execute malicious code, extract information, and disable systems.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker can obtain a valid session cookie and then force the administrator to use this cookie when logging in. After the admin logs in, the attacker can then use this stolen cookie to take over the session.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to obtain a valid JSESSIONID, and then needs to be able to set the cookie on the administrator's browser."
