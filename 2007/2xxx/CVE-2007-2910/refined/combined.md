  ## vBulletin 3.6.7 Released

  Tue 15 May '07, 8:50am

  **vBulletin 3.6.7**

  The 3.6.7 package has been updated as of 18:30 UTC, May 16th 2007

  As much as we hate to spring another upgrade on you all so soon after the release of vBulletin 3.6.6, an XSS flaw was identified today and in order to maintain our commitment to fix security problems as soon as we become aware of them, we have to release 3.6.7 and a patch for older versions.

  All versions of vBulletin 3.6 prior to 3.6.7 are vulnerable to the XSS. vBulletin 3.5.x and 3.0.x are **not** affected.

  To minimize the pain of another upgrade, there are **no changed templates since 3.6.6** and no database schema changes, so the upgrade should be as simple and quick as possible.

  Since we have fixed several bugs since vBulletin 3.6.6 was released, these fixes are also incorporated in this version and include amongst others:
  + [RTL support for date picker popup](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/project.php?issueid=22020)
  + [Fixed HTML for archive forum lists](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/project.php?issueid=22008)
  + [MySQL error while merging users fixed](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/project.php?issueid=22031)
  + [Smilie parsing error fixed](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/project.php?issueid=22015)
  + [PHP 5.0.5 errors fixed](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/project.php?issueid=22035)
  + [Hard-coded image paths fixed](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/project.php?issueid=22021)[A complete list of bugs fixed in the 3.6 branch is available in the project manager](http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/project.php?s=&do=issuelist&projectid=6&sortfield=lastpost&sortorder=&issuetypeid=bug&appliesgroupid=7&issuestatusid=4).

  Please accept our apologies for bringing out a new version just days after the previous release. We're sorry.

  **Fixing the XSS Bug**

  The XSS problem can be resolved in one of three ways.
  1. **Full Upgrade**: The best way to fix the problem is to perform a full upgrade, downloading the complete 3.6.7 package from the [vBulletin Members' Area](http://members.vbulletin.com) and following the regular [upgrade instructions](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/upgrade?manualversion=30607500). This is the only option that will not only fix the XSS issue, but will also apply all the bug fixes made since the release of 3.6.6.
  2. **Patch**: A second option is to download the patch files either in the [Members' Area](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php) or attached to this thread and upload them to your web server, overwriting the existing files.

     Patch file: **366\_patch.zip**
  3. **Plugin**: The plugin system built into vBulletin 3.6 allows the problem to be fixed with a simple plugin. The install file for this plugin is also attached to this thread and is the easiest way to fix the problem, as it does not require you to upload any files via FTP. The plugin will be automatically removed when you perform your next full upgrade. You can install the plugin by following the instructions [here](http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/import_product?manualversion=30607500).

     Plugin File: **vb\_calendar366\_xss\_fix\_plugin.xml****Please note the following**:
  + The plugin can be used with any previous version of vBulletin 3.6
  + The patch can only be applied to vBulletin 3.6.4, 3.6.5 or 3.6.6
  + You may perform a full upgrade to vBulletin 3.6.7 from any previous version of vBulletin 3.

  Several people have asked both on the forums and in the support ticket system for exact details of the changes to the **FORUMHOME** and **navbar** templates between 3.6.5 and 3.6.6/7, so here they are:

  **navbar**

  Remove this code completely:
  HTML Code:
  ```
  <script type="text/javascript">
  <!--
  function log_out()
  {
  	ht = document.getElementsByTagName("html");
  	ht[0].style.filter = "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(grayscale=1)";
  	if (confirm('$vbphrase[sure_you_want_to_log_out]'))
  	{
  		return true;
  	}
  	else
  	{
  		ht[0].style.filter = "";
  		return false;
  	}
  }
  //-->
  </script>
  ```
  Then find this code
  HTML Code:
  ```
  onclick="return log_out()"
  ```
  and replace it with this code
  HTML Code:
  ```
  onclick="return log_out('$vbphrase[sure_you_want_to_log_out]')"
  ```
  **FORUMHOME**

  Find this code
  HTML Code:
  ```
  onclick="return log_out()"
  ```
  and replace it with this code
  HTML Code:
  ```
  onclick="return log_out('$vbphrase[sure_you_want_to_log_out]')"
  ```

  XSS - More patches and plugins

  It would appear that the XSS that necessitated the release of 3.6.7 extends to another system we did not appreciate at the time of the release.

  Therefore, here are a further set of patches and plugins for you to apply.

  Here are your options, depending on the version of vBulletin you are currently running.

  Currently running **vBulletin 3.6.7**

  Either:
  + Download the patch for 3.6.7 from the [members' area](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php) (or this thread - 367\_patch.zip) and upload the contents to your forum directory

    **or**
  + Apply the plugin *vb\_367\_xss\_fix\_plugin.xml* attached to this threadThose using vBulletin 3.6.7 can make use of the new Patch Level release system, which allows the correct version number to be displayed in the admin control panel - with the patch applied, your version number in the ACP will reflect the fact that you are now running **3.6.7 PL1**.

  Currently running **vBulletin 3.6.4, 3.6.5 or 3.6.6**

  Either:
  + Upgrade to the new vBulletin 3.6.7 package available in the [members' area](http://members.vbulletin.com)

    **or**
  + Download the patch for 3.6.6 available in the [members' area](http://members.vbulletin.com/patches.php) (or this thread - 366\_patch.zip) and upload the contents to your forum directory

    **or**
  + Apply the plugin *vb\_366\_xss\_fix\_plugin.xml* attached to this thread

  Currently running **vBulletin 3.6.x** *older than* **3.6.4**

  Either:
  + Upgrade to the vBulletin 3.6.7 package available in the [members' area](http://members.vbulletin.com)

    **or**
  + Apply the plugin *vb\_366\_xss\_fix\_plugin.xml* attached to this thread

  Once again, we are sorry that this latest problem has occurred. We are looking into ways to ensure that this sort of thing does not happen again.

  Pages lag after loading?

  It has come to our attention that some forums are experiencing a lag after loading pages, resulting in users having to wait before they are able to interact with the forum.

  If you find yourself having this problem, please open the file **clientscript/vbulletin\_global.js** and find the following code:
  Code:
  ```
  this.find_elements(document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]);
  ```
  then comment-out the line like this:
  Code:
  ```
  [color=red][B]//[/B][/color]this.find_elements(document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]);
  ```
  This should fix the problem without affecting the functioning of your forum.
