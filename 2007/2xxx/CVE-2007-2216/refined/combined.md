**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This critical security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

The security update is rated critical for supported releases of Internet Explorer 5.01 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1. For Internet Explorer 6 for supported versions and editions of Windows XP Home and Windows XP Professional, the security update is also rated critical, otherwise it is rated moderate for other supported operating systems. For Internet Explorer 7 for supported versions and editions of Windows XP and Windows XP Professional, and Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista, the security update is rated Important, otherwise it is rated low. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses two vulnerabilities by setting the kill bit for ActiveX controls, and addresses the third vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles certain strings in CSS files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

## CSS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0943

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer parses certain strings in CSS. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged on user..

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-0943](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0943).

#### Mitigating Factors for CSS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0943

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* Internet Explorer 6 and 7 are not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for CSS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0943

We have not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for CSS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0943

## ActiveX Object Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2216

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the ActiveX control, tlbinf32.dll. This control can also be found under the name of vstlbinf.dll. Both of these components were never intended to be supported in Internet Explorer. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited the Web page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged on user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-2216](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-2216).

#### Mitigating Factors for ActiveX Object Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2216

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for ActiveX Object Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2216

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer**

  You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

  **Note** The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the COM objects are contained are documented under âWhat does the update do?â in the âFAQ for ActiveX Object Vulnerability **-** CVE-2007-2216â subsection. Replace {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX} below with the Class Identifiers found in that FAQ subsection.

  To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{ XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX }]
  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

  + [Group Policy collection](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd)
  + [What is Group Policy Object Editor?](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a3)
  + [Core Group Policy tools and settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc9491)

  **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround**: There is no impact as long as the object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of workaround**: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

**Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

The control implemented IObjectsafety incorrectly. For more information about IObjectsafety, visit the Microsoft [TechNet](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa768224.aspx) Web site

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visit a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What is the ActiveX opt-in feature in Windows Internet Explorer 7?**

Windows Internet Explorer 7 includes an ActiveX opt-in feature, which means that nearly all pre-installed ActiveX controls are off by default. Users are prompted by the Information Bar before they can instantiate a previously installed ActiveX control that has not yet been used on the Internet. This enables a user to permit or deny access on a control-by-control basis. For more information about this and other new features, see the Windows Internet Explorer 7 features page.

## ActiveX Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-3041

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the ActiveX object, pdwizard.ocx. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged on user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-3041](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3041).

#### Mitigating Factors for ActiveX Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-3041

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for ActiveX Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-3041

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer**

  You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

  **Note** The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the COM objects are contained are documented under âWhat does the update do?â in the âFAQ for ActiveX Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-3041â subsection. Replace {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX} below with the Class Identifiers found in this section.

  To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{ XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX }]
  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

  + [Group Policy collection](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd)
  + [What is Group Policy Object Editor?](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a3)
  + [Core Group Policy tools and settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc9491)

  **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

  **Impact of Workaround**: There is no impact as long as the object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround**: There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Vista (all editions)

These assessments allow businesses to make more informed decisions and drive revenue growth. The point of sale (POS) industry is no exception.

Today’s [POS systems](https://posquote.com/best-restaurant-pos-systems/) collect huge amounts of data, including sensitive customer data. That data must be safeguarded by top data security protocols and procedures.

Consumers have concerns and need reassurance that their data is being protected.

When it comes to protecting your business, especially when data is involved, you need to take every precaution possible. This means you should have regular security assessments done by a company that specializes in cyber security. Security assessments identify vulnerabilities that criminals could exploit to attack your company’s systems and data, as well as help you develop contingency plans to deal with any attacks or disasters that may occur.

A security assessment is a detailed review of all systems and networks, including physical and virtual components within your company’s infrastructure. These assessments cover everything from data access controls and authentication protocols to software patch levels and aging hardware. They also provide a prioritized list of gaps, with a plan for how to fill those gaps. This helps your IT team create realistic budgets for future security expenses, and it also allows you to build a strong culture of cybersecurity awareness amongst employees.

The Importance of a Security Assessment also helps you meet compliance requirements for regulatory bodies, such as HIPAA for healthcare companies or PCI DSS for retail businesses. It is not enough to simply comply with these regulations, you need to show that you are working hard to prevent breaches and attacks from occurring in the first place. A security assessment provides the documentation you need to demonstrate that your business is making these efforts. This will not only protect you from fines and penalties, but it will also protect your customers’ data as well.

**They ask themselves questions like:**

* How safe *is* the personal data I give to companies I do business with?
* Can unknown third-party entities access my data?
* How easily could hackers access the data stored by vendors I purchase from?
* Are the systems those businesses use prone to viruses that could make my data vulnerable?

These are important questions that align with common concerns consumers have in today’s digital, data-driven world.

# **What Is It Important to Conduct a Security Assessment?**

**![](data:image/svg+xml...)**

This requires carrying out a data security risk assessment, complying with the latest data security protocols, and becoming certified by the highest industry standards of data protection.

But how do you perform a security assessment? Do you need a security risk assessment tool? Or a special cyber security risk assessment template? How do you even begin?

Below we’ll dig into this topic and unpack important information that any business storing customer data need to know and understand.

Then we’ll touch on benefits and other important points to keep in mind when conducting a data security risk assessment.

First, we’ll start with some basics for those starting to learn about data security, and a refresher for those already knowledgeable about the subject.

# **What Is a Security Risk Assessment?**

Also known as a cyber security risk assessment or an IT security risk assessment, it is essentially what it sounds like. It’s an audit of the systems you store data in, and the security measures you have in place to protect that data.

This audit generates a security risk assessment report that analyses your business’s data security preparedness and how secure your customer data actually is.

Common assessments evaluate how vulnerable your information technology (IT) solutions and internal operating processes are. They also provide informed recommendations for improvements in your security practices.

The end results is maximum insight into how secure your data is and which measures will reduce its vulnerability.

# **Why Are Security Risk Assessments So Important?**

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/security-risk-assessment-300x246.png)Your [retail customers](https://posquote.com/retail-pos/) trust you with their data when doing business with you. They don’t need or want to be concerned about its safety.

In an age where a single cyberattack can spell financial ruin for any company, the importance of security risk assessment is more important than ever. Whether due to regulatory requirements aimed at protecting sensitive information or the desire to keep customers and business partners happy, companies of all sizes must invest time, resources and money into assessing and mitigating their risk.

To be effective, any security risk assessment must identify and understand all the assets within an organization. This means generating a map of all hardware, applications and data storage containers that might be vulnerable to attack. Once an asset map is established, it is possible to determine how a specific threat would impact each asset and the likelihood of occurrence. Then, it becomes a matter of prioritizing the most valuable assets to protect first. Trade secrets, user data and intellectual property take precedence over the cost of restoring primary business functions after an attack.

Lastly, the assessment must evaluate and score the company’s protocols in comparison to recognized standards. This is particularly true for industries like healthcare, which are required to reveal their storage and data sharing practices in order to meet government regulations such as HIPAA.

A security risk assessment can help a company remain compliant with these regulatory frameworks, as well as create transparency and trust in the minds of the company’s clients, customers and partners. It is a crucial tool for any business that must balance the need to protect its brand image and personal information with the need to keep the company’s systems running efficiently.

Proving to your customers that you are certified by the most stringent data security protocols is critical to building trust in your brand.

If prospects are not convinced that their data will be 100% secure, they are far less likely to do business with you.

Plus, if you do experience a data breach, it can have devastating impacts on your business. It can, in fact, mean the end of your business.

Unfortunately, smaller businesses suffer the most from data hacks and breaches.

**Consider these statistics:**

* 43% of data-related cyber attacks are targeted at small businesses ([Source](https://smallbiztrends.com/2016/04/cyber-attacks-target-small-business.html)).
* 60% of small businesses that experience a cyber attack find themselves out of business within six months or less ([Source](https://www.denverpost.com/2016/10/23/small-companies-cyber-attack-out-of-business/))

### **Basic Cyber Attacks**

You may already be familiar with the most basic types of cyber attacks. Here we cover the two most common types.

### **Malware Attacks**

![cyber attack pos](data:image/svg+xml...)![cyber attack pos](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cyber-attack-pos-300x169.png)Malware takes its name from the two words that describe it, taken from two different languages.

“Mal” means “bad” in Spanish. Tack on the end of the word “software” and you have “malware.”

The term malware refers to worms, viruses, spyware, and ransomware.

Malware is, in the most basic sense, bad software that installs itself or otherwise gains access to the data in an operating system. This generally happens when someone clicks an unknown, risky link in an email or downloads a dangerous attachment.

Clicking the link or opening the attachment sets in motion the installation of that “bad software” on your operating system. It takes place behind the scenes and is well masked, so you don’t notice.

Once installed, malware can:

* Obtain sensitive data from your database without your knowledge
* Prevent access from key processes and components of your operating system
* Interrupt the functioning of important components of your operating system, rendering it inoperable

### **Phishing Attacks**

![phishing attack pos](data:image/svg+xml...)![phishing attack pos](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/phishing-attack-300x243.png)“Phishing” refers to the practice of sending fake emails that, on the surface, appear to be legit communications from known entities.

Their primary goal is to manipulate recipients into disclosing sensitive personal data such as credit card and login information.

Phishing attacks also, at times, install malware on the recipient’s operating system.

### **Advanced Cyber Attacks**

More advanced cyber attacks are harder to detect and have more serious consequences when carried out successfully.

They can dig deeper into your database to uncover more secure data than basic attacks can. They use advanced masking techniques that allow the attacks to fly under the radar of many data security checkpoints, making them more dangerous and a greater risk.

This is why it’s quite important to understand the range of cyber attacks and put in place measures to catch them all, not just the basic ones.

## **The Benefits of Regular Assessments**

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/security-assessment-benefits-1.jpg)The primary benefit of conducting regular security risk assessments is, obviously, to protect the sensitive data you store. However, additional benefits exist.

**Here are some key benefits:**

* Identifying potential threats before they take place
* Spotting vulnerabilities in your security systems so you can resolve them before they are exploited
* Predicting the effects that specific, potential attacks could have on your business
* Providing cyber threat recovery options
* Increasing awareness of the types of attacks that pose the largest threat at any given time
* Taking actions ahead of time to prevent potential attacks
* Improving your brand reputation and reassuring prospects and customers that their data will be safe when they do business with your company
* Increasing compliance with payment card industry (PCI) data protection standards to provide peace of mind to customers performing online payments

## **In-House Vs. Outsourced Risk Assessments**

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/in-house-or-outsourcing-300x150.jpg)Larger businesses with in-house data protection teams and officers can more easily conduct assessments than smaller businesses with fewer resources. And those larger businesses typically start with an in-house security risk assessment.

Smaller businesses that don’t have the in-house capacity to conduct a security risk assessment often hire a third-party assessor to carry out the task. Doing so may seem more expensive than doing it in-house.

However, conducting your own security risk assessment in-house requires having a dedicated team on the payroll. So, at the end of the day, it may actually be cheaper to outsource.

Plus, many businesses that do assessments in-house can, at times, miss well-disguised threats. They then hire a third-party to do another assessment to ensure nothing was missed.

The route you take will depend on your budget and whether or not you keep an in-house security risk team on the payroll.

## **Recommended Best Practices**

To cover every recommended practice around data security would require a separate article because the scope of that topic is so broad.

But here we share some of the key practices every business should keep in mind when developing a plan for protecting the data in their [POS system](https://posquote.com/best-pos-systems/).

### **Employee Data Security Training**

![data security training](data:image/svg+xml...)![data security training](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/data-security-training-300x182.png)There are various data security training courses that businesses can implement to employees.

These courses are generally taken online and educate employees on basic and more advanced tactics they can practice themselves to protect their data.

When selecting a training course, be sure to look for one that has been certified by top data security protocols.

### **Backing Up Your Data**

These days most businesses conduct security risk assessments on cloud-based databases. This allows them to automatically back up data so that it is recoverable if it is stolen or otherwise destroyed or rendered inaccessible.

Backing up data is a must for businesses that use POS systems, and virtually every other type of business as well.

### **Strict Password Requirements**

![strict password](data:image/svg+xml...)![strict password](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/strict-passwords-300x225.jpg)

The more complicated a password is, the harder it is for hackers to identify it. That’s why it is important to implement stringent password requirements.

Common practices include requiring at least one capital letter, one number, and one non-alphanumeric symbol. It is also advisable to require users to create long passwords—eight characters at minimum.

Finally, businesses should require employees to change their login password every year at least, and every six months if possible. Plus, you should restrict the use of old passwords that employees have used in the past.

### **Limit User Privileges**

POS systems give businesses the ability to determine the level of data access that each user has.

Some users may only be able to access certain functions but be restricted from others. That is necessary. If *everyone* had access to do *everything* in your system, chaos could ensue.

### **Set Up a Firewall**

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/firewall-300x225.jpg)This may seem obvious but at a very basic level, it is necessary to have standard virus protection and a firewall around your data to prevent breaches.

Any decent POS system should allow you to install virus protection software and a firewall if the system doesn’t already come with those things out of the box.

### **Conduct Assessments Often**

Data security experts recommend that you conduct a security risk assessment once a month, or at least once per quarter.

Data management changes stemming from new projects have the capacity to render previously secure data processes insecure.

New threats pop up all the time so having a strict cadence around your security risk assessment is crucially important.

### **Additional Layers of Protection**

Think of data protection measures like layers of an onion. The data is at the center but to get to it you must peel off various layers, each one being a little harder to peel.

Similarly, data protection should include multiple layers to minimize vulnerability. Below are a few additional layers of protection you can put in place to ensure your data is safer.

### **Renewing Employee Certification**

Once an employee successfully completes a data security training course and becomes certified, they should retake the course every year. This helps employees to stay up to date on emerging threats and risks, and understand how to deal with them.

### **Physical Security Components**

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/lock-system-300x199.jpg)A physical security risk assessment should be part of your overall assessment process.

It’s advisable to install a closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring system with cameras so you can check out what happened if a data breach occurs on site.

You should also include other basic physical security layers like coded locking systems to keep your business safe during closed hours.

If your data is highly sensitive, you can also employ guards, install fences, and leverage other practical security measures.

### **Data Encryption**

Data encryption is a big one. The data passing from an employee into the POS system should be encrypted. And the data that passes from the system into the data server should also be encrypted.

### **User Roles**

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://posquote.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/user-roles-pos-300x211.png)As mentioned above, it’s important to restrict the access each employee has to your data. You can do this by giving each user a “user role.”

These can range from an “admin” user who has access to everything, to a “standard user” who can only see limited data.

Let’s use an example of a hypothetical situation a business could encounter during a risk assessment. A new employee starts her first day, and she is given access to all the data in the system.

Now she can see payroll information about her boss, revenue numbers, and other information that is above her paygrade.

Implementing user roles lets you limit access per employee based upon which data they *need* to access.

# **Wrapping It Up**

Data security risk assessments are vital to the safety of your data. New strategies of attack are conceived in the minds of hackers every day.

It is important to stay ahead of those who would steal your and your customers’ data. By following the tips above you can ensure you have the right measures and processes in place to prevent attacks before they happen.

Plus, the advice outlined above will help you quickly resolve any data attacks that ever do happen.

The businesses that embrace data security risk assessments and put in place a strict data protection regime will be the ones that succeed today and in the future.

Those businesses that don’t take data security seriously and do not conduct data security risk assessments will be those who get hacked, lose customers, and ultimately fade from existence.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
