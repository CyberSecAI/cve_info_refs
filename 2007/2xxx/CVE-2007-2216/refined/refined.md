  "CVE-2007-2216": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the ActiveX control, tlbinf32.dll (also known as vstlbinf.dll). This control was never intended to be supported in Internet Explorer. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited the Web page.",
    "root_cause": "The ActiveX control `tlbinf32.dll` (or `vstlbinf.dll`) does not implement `IObjectSafety` correctly, leading to memory corruption.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect implementation of IObjectSafety leading to memory corruption."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution with the same user rights as the logged-on user.",
    "attack_vector": "A specially crafted web page that exploits the ActiveX control vulnerability. Users must visit this malicious web page.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create and host a malicious web page. The attacker needs to persuade users to visit the web page, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in the ActiveX control 'tlbinf32.dll' (also found as 'vstlbinf.dll').  These controls were never intended to be supported in Internet Explorer. This update addresses the vulnerability by setting the kill bit for the specified ActiveX controls, preventing them from being instantiated in Internet Explorer. Class Identifiers (CLSIDs) affected are: {8B217746-717D-11CE-AB5B-D41203C10000}, {8B217752-717D-11CE-AB5B-D41203C10000}, {8B21775E-717D-11CE-AB5B-D41203C10000}."
