```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The application uses user-controlled parameters `doc_root` and `DOCUMENT_ROOT` to include files, leading to remote file inclusion.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability due to insecure use of user-provided data in file inclusion mechanisms.

Impact of exploitation:
- Allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary remote files on the server. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, full control of the server, data theft, or other malicious activities.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP GET requests with a malicious URL passed as the `doc_root` parameter in `localize.php` or `config.php`.
- HTTP GET requests with a malicious URL passed as the `DOCUMENT_ROOT` parameter in `config.php`.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to have access to a remote file server to host malicious files to be included by the vulnerable application.
