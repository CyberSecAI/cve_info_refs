**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2400

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a race condition within Apple Safari when handling HTTP redirections while updating pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  A race condition exists in how Safari processes HTTP redirects during page updates.
- This race condition can lead to a violation of the same-origin policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript or gain unauthorized access to content from a different domain.
- This is similar to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing attackers to:
   - Spoof or modify web content
   - Access website information, such as cookies
   - Retrieve data from encrypted HTTPS connections
- The vulnerability can be exploited by convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (web page, HTML email, or email attachment).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted HTML document that triggers the race condition during a redirect.
- This can be delivered via web pages, HTML emails, or email attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious HTML document to a Safari user.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same domain as the target to exploit the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required to view the malicious HTML.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to only affect Safari 3 beta, which was available for Mac OS X 10.4.9, Windows XP, and Vista at the time.
- The issue is addressed by Apple Safari Beta Update 3.0.2.
- Disabling JavaScript within Safari can mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Lawrence Lai, Stan Switzer, and Ed Rowe of Adobe Systems, Inc.
