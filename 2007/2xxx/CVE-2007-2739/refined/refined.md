Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of URLs within the php-xajax library. This lack of proper input validation allows attackers to inject malicious code through URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious scripts can be injected and executed within a user's browser when they interact with a vulnerable application. This is made possible because of the insufficient sanitization of URLs which can be used as attack vectors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser session.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially hijack user sessions, leading to unauthorized access and control.
- **Data Theft:** Stolen information or modified webpage can lead to potential data theft or corruption.
- **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user, such as manipulating content, redirecting to malicious sites, or impersonating the user on the vulnerable site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URLs:** Attackers inject their code into URLs.
- **User interaction:** Malicious URLs are typically delivered to users through various means (links in emails, on websites) and require the user to interact with them (click the link, load a webpage containing the malicious URL) for the exploit to be effective.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious URLs and trick a user into interacting with them.
- No special access to the server is needed to carry out the attack, as the vulnerability lies in how the application handles user input (URLs).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects the php-xajax library, which is used to develop Ajax applications.
- Debian has issued a security advisory (DSA-1692-1) to address this issue and provides updated packages for stable (etch), testing (lenny), and unstable (sid) distributions.
- The fix involves sanitizing the input to prevent cross-site scripting.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability described in CVE-2007-2739 is an XSS vulnerability in the php-xajax library due to inadequate URL sanitization. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious URLs that, when used by a vulnerable application, can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. This can lead to a range of malicious impacts such as session hijacking, data theft, and other unauthorized activities.
