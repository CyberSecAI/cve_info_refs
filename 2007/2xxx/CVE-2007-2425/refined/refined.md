  - **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation of the `album` parameter in `fileview.php`. The application directly includes the value of the `album` parameter in a `require` statement without proper sanitization.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Local File Inclusion (LFI): The vulnerability allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server file system.
    - Input Validation Failure: The `album` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in the `require` statement.

-   **Impact of exploitation**:
    - File Disclosure: An attacker can read sensitive files such as `/etc/passwd` by providing a path to the file in the `album` parameter.
    - Potential for further attacks: By including files, attackers can potentially gain more control over the system.

-   **Attack vectors**:
    - HTTP GET Request: The attacker sends a GET request to the `fileview.php` script, including a crafted `album` parameter.
    - URL Encoding: The attacker uses URL encoding to bypass any checks and introduce null bytes to truncate paths.

-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
    - Basic knowledge of web vulnerabilities and file paths.
