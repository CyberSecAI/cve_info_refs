{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-2486",
      "root_cause": "The `download.asp` script in PStruh-CZ 1.3 and 1.5 is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `download.asp` script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path using the `File` parameter.",
         "The script does not validate or restrict the file path provided by the user. ",
        "The script utilizes a `PT` (PostFix) parameter, which also appears to be vulnerable but is not well described within this content."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially including sensitive system files or application configuration files.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A remote attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request to the `download.asp` script with a malicious `File` parameter that includes directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`)."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and know that the `download.asp` script exists and the structure of parameters used.",
       "additional_information": "The vulnerability can be exploited by using URL encoding to bypass basic filtering."
