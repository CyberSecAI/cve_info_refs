Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2048

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The webMethods Glue Management Console is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack due to improper handling of the `resource` parameter in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the input provided to the `resource` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify paths to arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Medium Severity:** An attacker can read arbitrary system files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, system files, or other data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the webMethods Glue Management Console, specifically targeting the `resource` parameter. Examples include:
    *   `http://glueconsole:8080/console?resource=../../../boot.ini`
    *   `http://glueconsole:8080/console?resource=\boot.ini`
    *   `http://glueconsole:8080/console?resource=c:\boot.ini`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the webMethods Glue Management Console.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to make HTTP requests and modify URL parameters.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered during a quick audit by Patrick Webster.
*   The vendor was notified but did not respond before public disclosure.
*   The advisory mentions that traversal to other volumes may be possible but was untested.
*   The provided examples demonstrate successful retrieval of the `boot.ini` file, indicating that the vulnerability can be easily exploited.
