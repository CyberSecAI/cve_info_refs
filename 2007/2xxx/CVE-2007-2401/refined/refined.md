Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2401:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Apple WebCore serializes headers when creating an HTTP request using the `XMLHttpRequest` object. It fails to properly serialize the headers, leading to a cross-domain security violation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper header serialization within the `XMLHttpRequest` object in Apple WebCore.
- Cross-domain security violation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious HTML document (e.g., webpage, HTML email, or attachment).
- If a user views the malicious document, the attacker can execute scripts or gain unauthorized access to content from different domains.
- This is comparable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, potentially enabling the attacker to:
    - Spoof or modify web content.
    - Access website information, such as cookies.
    - Retrieve data from encrypted HTTPS connections.

**Attack vectors:**
- By convincing a user to open a specially crafted HTML document. This could be via:
    - Visiting a malicious webpage.
    - Opening a malicious HTML email message.
    - Opening a malicious HTML email attachment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or distribute a malicious HTML document.
- The attacker needs to persuade the victim to view the HTML document with a vulnerable version of Apple WebCore.
