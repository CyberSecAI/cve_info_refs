How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

The user is then able to temporarily issue SMB/CIFS protocol operations as the root user.  This window of opportunity may allow the attacker to establish addition means of gaining root access to the server.   ================== Patch Availability ==================  A patch against Samba 3.0.23d/3.0.24 has been attached to this email.  At the time of public disclosure, the patch will be posted to <http://www.samba.org/samba/security/>.   ========== Workaround ==========  There is no immediate workaround for this defect that does not involve changing the server code in the smbd daemon. The Samba Team always encourages users to run the latest stable release as a defense against attacks.  If this is not immediately possible, administrators should read the "Server Security" documentation found at    <http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/server_security.html>   ======= Credits =======  This vulnerability was reported to Samba developers by Paul Griffith <paulg@cse.yorku.ca> and Andrew Hogue.  Much thanks to Paul and Andrew for their cooperation and patience in the announcement of this defect.  Thanks also to Samba developers James Peach and Jeremy Allison for the analysis and resolution of this issue.  The time line is as follows:  * March 20, 2007: Defect first reported to the security@samba.org   email alias. * March 30, 2007: Initial developer response by Gerald Carter. * April 4, 2007: Patch released to bug reporter for testing. * April 9, 2007: Fixed confirmed by original reporter. * May 3, 2007: Announcement to vendor-sec mailing list * May 14, 2007: Proposed date for public announcement of the   security issue.    ========================================================== == Our Code, Our Bugs, Our Responsibility. == The Samba Team ========================================================== ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-04 13:20:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 118137](attachment.cgi?id=118137 "3.0.24-sid2name_elevation.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=118137&action=edit "3.0.24-sid2name_elevation.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=118137&action=diff "3.0.24-sid2name_elevation.patch")] 3.0.24-sid2name_elevation.patch ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-04 13:22:34 UTC  ``` Tiziano please attach an updated ebuild to this bug and we will call arch security liaisons for testing.

After further investigation by Samba developers, it was determined that the problem was much broader and impacts remote printer and file share management as well.  The root cause is passing unfiltered user input provided via MS-RPC calls to /bin/sh when invoking externals scripts defined in smb.conf.  However, unlike the "username map script" vulnerability, the remote file and printer management scripts require an authenticated user session.   ================== Patch Availability ==================  A patch against Samba 3.0.24 has been attached to this email.  At the time of public disclosure, the patch will be posted to <http://www.samba.org/samba/security/>. Back ports of the patch to to Samba 2.2.12, 3.0.9, and 3.0.10 are available upon request thanks to Samba/RedHat developer Simo Sorce <idra@samba.org>.   ========== Workaround ==========  This defect may be alleviated by removing all defined external script invocations (username map script, add printer command, etc...) from smb.conf.  The Samba Team always encourages users to run the latest stable release as a defense against attacks.  If this is not immediately possible, administrators should read the "Server Security" documentation found at    <http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/server_security.html>   ======= Credits =======  This vulnerability was reported to Samba developers by Joshua J. Drake, iDefense Labs (<http://www.idefense.com/>), as part of their Vulnerability Contributor Program.  The time line is as follows:  * May 7, 2007: Initial defect disclosure to the security@samba.org   email alias. * May 7, 2007: Initial developer response by Samba   developer Gerald Carter. * May 9, 2007: Patch released by Samba developer Jeremy Allison   to iDefense for testing. * May 10, Announcement to vendor-sec mailing list * May 14, 2007: Proposed date for public announcement of the   security issue.    ========================================================== == Our Code, Our Bugs, Our Responsibility. == The Samba Team ========================================================== ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-11 07:37:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 118832](attachment.cgi?id=118832 "3.0.24-shell_escape.patch") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=118832&action=edit "3.0.24-shell_escape.patch"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=118832&action=diff "3.0.24-shell_escape.patch")] 3.0.24-shell_escape.patch  Upstream fix for CVE-2007-2447. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-11 07:39:00 UTC  ``` ========================================================== == == Subject:     Multiple Heap Overflows Allow Remote ==              Code Execution == CVE ID#:     CVE-2007-2446 == == Versions:    Samba 3.0.0 - 3.0.25rc3 (inclusive) == == Summary:     Various bugs in Samba's NDR parsing ==              can allow a user to send specially ==              crafted MS-RPC requests that will ==              overwrite the heap space with user ==              defined data. == ==========================================================  =========== Description ===========  Various bugs in Samba's NDR parsing can allow a user to send specially crafted MS-RPC requests that will overwrite the heap space with user defined data.   ================== Patch Availability ==================  A patch against Samba 3.0.24 has been attached to this email.

## Samba command injection vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#268336

Original Release Date: 2007-05-14 | Last Revised: 2008-07-21

---

### Overview

Samba fails to properly filter input to /bin/sh. This vulnerability may allow a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a Samba server.

### Description

| Samba provides file and print services for Microsoft Windows, Unix, Linux, and OS X clients. Samba can also act as a Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or as a Domain Member. Samba runs on most Unix-like systems.  Samba versions prior to 3.0.24 pass unchecked user input from RPC messages to /bin/sh when calling externals scripts that are listed in the Samba configuration file. An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted RPC messages to a vulnerable server.This vulnerability occurred as a result of failing to comply with recommndation [STR02-C](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/x/-AY) of the CERT C Programming Language Secure Coding Standard. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch or upgrade**These vulnerabilities are addressed in Samba version [3.0.25](http://www.samba.org/samba/history/samba-3.0.25.html). In addition, patches are available to address this vulnerability in Samba version 3.0.24. Refer to the Samba Security Releases [website](http://samba.org/samba/history/security.html) for more information. |
| --- |

| **Do not load external shell scripts**  From the CVE-2007-2447 entry on the [Samba security](http://us1.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2007-2447.html) page:*This defect may be alleviated by removing all defined external script invocations (username map script, add printer command, etc...) from smb.conf.***Restrict access**Limiting access to the Samba server to trusted hosts may mitigate this vulnerability. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Samba: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200705-15**

Samba contains multiple vulnerabilities potentially resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-fs/samba** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.0.24-r2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.0.24-r2** |

### Background

Samba is a suite of SMB and CIFS client/server programs for UNIX.

### Description

Samba contains a logical error in the smbd daemon when translating
local SID to user names (CVE-2007-2444). Furthermore, Samba contains
several bugs when parsing NDR encoded RPC parameters (CVE-2007-2446).
Lastly, Samba fails to properly sanitize remote procedure input
provided via Microsoft Remote Procedure Calls (CVE-2007-2447).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain root
privileges via various vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Samba users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/samba-3.0.24-r2"
```

# USN-460-1: Samba vulnerabilities

16 May 2007

Samba vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Paul Griffith and Andrew Hogue discovered that Samba did not fully drop

root privileges while translating SIDs. A remote authenticated user

could issue SMB operations during a small window of opportunity and gain

root privileges. ([CVE-2007-2444](/security/CVE-2007-2444))

Brian Schafer discovered that Samba did not handle NDR parsing

correctly. A remote attacker could send specially crafted MS-RPC

requests that could overwrite heap memory and execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2007-2446](/security/CVE-2007-2446))

It was discovered that Samba did not correctly escape input parameters

for external scripts defined in smb.conf. Remote authenticated users

could send specially crafted MS-RPC requests and execute arbitrary shell

commands. ([CVE-2007-2447](/security/CVE-2007-2447))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* samba
  -
  3.0.24-2ubuntu1.1

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* samba
  -
  3.0.22-1ubuntu4.2

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* samba
  -
  3.0.22-1ubuntu3.3

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.
