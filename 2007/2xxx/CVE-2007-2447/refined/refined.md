{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Samba fails to properly sanitize user input passed to external scripts, which are invoked using /bin/sh.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Command injection: Unescaped user-provided parameters passed to /bin/sh.",
    "Lack of input sanitization: User input from MS-RPC calls not properly sanitized before being used in external script invocations."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote, authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the Samba server with the privileges of the user running the Samba process, often root, leading to full system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote, authenticated attacker sends specially crafted MS-RPC requests to trigger the execution of external scripts with malicious arguments.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be authenticated to the Samba service and have the ability to send RPC requests."
