*   **Weakness:** The presence of a CAPTCHA suggests a potential vulnerability to automated attacks, such as bot-driven submissions or brute-force attempts. The specific vulnerability isn't detailed, but CAPTCHAs are commonly used to mitigate such risks.

*   **Attack Vector:** Automated scripts or bots attempting to bypass security measures.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create and execute automated scripts or use botnets.

**Content from www.majorsecurity.de:**
