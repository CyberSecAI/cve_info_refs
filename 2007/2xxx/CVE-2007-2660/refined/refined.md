      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the `$g_pcltar_lib_dir` variable in `pcltar.lib.php` and `pcltrace.lib.php` files of the CJG EXPLORER PRO v3.2 application, where an attacker can control the include path.",

      "details": {
       "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way the PclTar module (specifically versions 1.3 and 1.3.1) handles the `$g_pcltar_lib_dir` variable, which is used in include statements. The `pcltar.lib.php` file includes other files based on this variable without proper sanitization. ",

           "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
