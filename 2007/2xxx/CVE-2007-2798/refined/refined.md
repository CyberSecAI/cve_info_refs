## Analysis of CVE-2007-2798

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Description:** A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the MIT Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) related to how it handles the principal renaming operation. Specifically, the `kadmind` code passes unchecked string arguments (old and new principal names) to a `sprintf()` call, which uses a fixed-size stack buffer as its destination.

**Root Cause:** Insufficient bounds checking on the string arguments passed to `sprintf()` during the principal renaming operation in kadmind.

**Vulnerability:** Stack buffer overflow.

**Attack Vector:** A remote, authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to kadmind containing overly long principal names.

**Impact:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected system. This could lead to a complete compromise of the Kerberos key database and the KDC host.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Unsuccessful exploitation attempts will likely cause kadmind to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Required Capabilities:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate to kadmind to perform the attack. However, no administrative privileges are required, as the vulnerable code executes before privilege verification.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network requests to the kadmind service.

**Affected Software:** MIT Kerberos (krb5) releases up to and including krb5-1.6.1.

**Mitigation:** Apply the patch provided by MIT or upgrade to krb5-1.6.2 or krb5-1.5.4 (or later versions) which contain the fix.

This analysis incorporates details from various sources, including the vulnerability note from CERT and the MIT krb5 Security Advisory.
