    "content": "The provided content describes a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability in YAAP 1.5. The vulnerability is located in `public_html\\includes\\common.php`.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the use of a variable `$root_path` in an include statement without proper sanitization. The code snippet `include_once($root_path.'/classes/'.$class_name.'.php');` allows an attacker to control the value of `$root_path` through a GET parameter, leading to the inclusion of arbitrary files.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Remote File Inclusion (RFI)\n- Lack of input validation\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Arbitrary code execution on the server by including malicious files.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script `includes/common.php`\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- Attacker can be remote and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.\n- Attacker needs to know or guess the path to the vulnerable script"
