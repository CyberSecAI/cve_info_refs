Watchfire's Appscan product looks for this vulnerability (not sure what
they officially title it, the title above is my own), but I can't find any
reference to it. Google finds a lot of indirect references suggesting it
is common knowledge to the folks who use the product. Has anyone seen this
before or have a reference?

Requesting this URL will generate the error message:

http://[target]/axis/tt_pm4l.jws?wsdl
