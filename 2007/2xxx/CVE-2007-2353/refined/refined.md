Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper error handling by Apache AXIS when a request is made for a non-existent Java Web Service (.jws) file. Instead of a generic error message, AXIS reveals the full server-side file path of the requested file in the error response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** The vulnerability lies in the server's disclosure of its internal file paths. This occurs when a request for a non-existent `.jws` file results in an error message revealing the full file path, e.g., `c:\inetpub\wwwroot\axis\tt_pm4l.jws`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can gain sensitive information about the server's file structure. This could reveal the location of application files, configuration files, and other potentially sensitive information.
*   **Further Exploitation:** Knowledge of file paths can be a stepping stone for more complex attacks. For instance, the attacker might look for configuration files with database credentials or locate other exploitable vulnerabilities in the file system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** The attack is performed by sending a direct HTTP request to the AXIS service for a non-existent `.jws` file. For example: `http://[target]/axis/tt_pm4l.jws?wsdl`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **Knowledge of AXIS Service:** The attacker must know that the target is running Apache AXIS and that it is possible to request a non-existent `.jws` file. No authentication or other specialized access is required.
