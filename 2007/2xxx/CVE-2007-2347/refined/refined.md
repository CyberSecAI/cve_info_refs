Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `komentar.php` file of Sisplet CMS, where the `site_path` variable is used in a `require()` function without proper sanitization. Specifically, the line `require($site_path.'main/forum/class.php');` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes a file based on user-controlled input (`site_path`), allowing an attacker to include a malicious file from a remote server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting a URL to a malicious PHP file through the `site_path` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable Sisplet CMS instance. This could lead to full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `komentar.php`, providing the malicious URL via the `site_path` parameter.
   Example: `http://SITE.com/path/main/forum/komentar.php?site_path=[SHELL]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic Understanding of Web Application Vulnerabilities:** The attacker should know how to exploit RFI vulnerabilities by crafting malicious URLs and including remote PHP files.
