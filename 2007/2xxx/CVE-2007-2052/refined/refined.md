      "source": "bugs.debian.org_5a42648c_20250125_214915.html",
      "details": "In Modules/_localemodule.c, PyLocale_strxfrm() miscalculates the length of the strxfrm() destination buffer, which causes the function to return a wrong string, and to read past the destination buffer, which may (and does) result in an information leak. The bug is also present in python2.5.\nHere, '\\x0c\\x01\\x08\\x01\\x02\\x01' comes from glibc's strxfrm(), and the rest of the string is the contents of the memory immediately after the destination buffer. (It is also possible to get identifiable parts of the strings processed by the program before the strxfrm() call but I don't have a reproducible test case for that).\nReal-world case, and how I have found the bug in the first place: a webapp that allows an user to upload some strings to the server, and other users to view them and sort them in various ways. Since Javascript doesn't have support for locale-aware string comparison, each string carries a sorting key, which is the return value of strxfrm(), and which is visible in the page source."
