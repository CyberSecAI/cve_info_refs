## Details

Piotr Engelking discovered that strxfrm in Python was not correctly

calculating the size of the destination buffer. This could lead to small

information leaks, which might be used by attackers to gain additional

knowledge about the state of a running Python script. ([CVE-2007-2052](/security/CVE-2007-2052))

A flaw was discovered in the Python imageop module. If a script using

the module could be tricked into processing a specially crafted set of

arguments, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code, or cause the

application to crash. ([CVE-2007-4965](/security/CVE-2007-4965))

Package        : python2.5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1679 CVE-2008-1721 CVE-2008-1887

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Python language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2007-2052

    Piotr Engelking discovered that the strxfrm() function of the locale
    module miscalculates the length of an internal buffer, which may
    result in a minor information disclosure.

CVE-2007-4965

    It was discovered that several integer overflows in the imageop
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, if a user is
    tricked into processing malformed images. This issue is also
    tracked as CVE-2008-1679 due to an initially incomplete patch.

CVE-2008-1721

    Justin Ferguson discovered that a buffer overflow in the zlib
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1887

    Justin Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in
    PyString_FromStringAndSize() may lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5-5+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.2-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.5 packages.

Package        : python2.4
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1679 CVE-2008-1721 CVE-2008-1887

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Python language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2007-2052

    Piotr Engelking discovered that the strxfrm() function of the locale
    module miscalculates the length of an internal buffer, which may
    result in a minor information disclosure.

CVE-2007-4965

    It was discovered that several integer overflows in the imageop
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, if a user is
    tricked into processing malformed images. This issue is also
    tracked as CVE-2008-1679 due to an initially incomplete patch.

CVE-2008-1721

    Justin Ferguson discovered that a buffer overflow in the zlib
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2008-1887

    Justin Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in
    PyString_FromStringAndSize() may lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.4-3+etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.5-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your python2.4 packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Package: python2.4
Version: 2.4.4-2
Severity: important
Tags: security patch

In Modules/_localemodule.c, PyLocale_strxfrm() miscalculates the length of
the strxfrm() destination buffer, which causes the function to return a
wrong string, and to read past the destination buffer, which may (and does)
result in an information leak. The bug is also present in python2.5.

The attached patch fixes this problem.

Subject: Off-by-one in python's locale.strxfrm()
Date: Mon, 02 Apr 2007 16:17:12 +0200
```
Piotr: Could you please provide a reproducer, or a string/locale couple
that triggered th bug for you?

In my system, when n1 returned by strxfrm() was equal to n2, the string
was terminated with \0, only that it was truncated (so a subsequent
attempt to read it did not lead to an out-of-bound read). Though the
manual states that the behavior is undefined. I did not try it in
Debian, but I can't really imagine why would Debian's glibc behave
differently from Fedora's one.

Btw. I can't imagine a real-world situation where would this lead to an
information disclosure. The return value of strxfrm() is never meant to
be displayed to the user.

Ok, sorry for being so terse in the original report:

$ cat foo
#!/usr/bin/python

import locale

print locale.setlocale(locale.LC_COLLATE, 'pl_PL.UTF8')
print repr(locale.strxfrm('a'))
$ ./foo
pl_PL.UTF8
'\x0c\x01\x08\x01\x02\x01\x18\x08\x10'
$

Here, '\x0c\x01\x08\x01\x02\x01' comes from glibc's strxfrm(), and the
rest of the string is the contents of the memory immediately after the
destination buffer. (It is also possible to get identifiable parts of
the strings processed by the program before the strxfrm() call but I
don't have a reproducible test case for that.)

Real-world case, and how I have found the bug in the first place: a
webapp that allows an user to upload some strings to the server, and
other users to view them and sort them in various ways. Since
Javascript doesn't have support for locale-aware string comparison,
each string carries a sorting key, which is the return value of
strxfrm(), and which is visible in the page source.

c. Third party library update for ntp.

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
this advisory.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant
for ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in this component (column 4) if a solution is available.

d. Service Console update for ntp

Service Console package ntp updated to version ntp-4.2.2pl-9el5\_3.2
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with a referenced time source.
The Service Console present in ESX is affected by the following
security issues.
A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the "ntp" user.
NTP authentication is not enabled by default on the Service Console.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.
A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A
malicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an
ntpq request that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ntpq
command.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0159 to this issue.
The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
in the Service Console (column 4) if a solution is available.

f. Updated Service Console package python

Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.
When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service.
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).
Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
service.
An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.
A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

g. Updated Service Console package bind

Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5
The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
(named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
is operating correctly.
A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.

h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
files.

A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these
issues.

i. Updated Service Console package curl

Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5\_3.5
A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.

Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5\_3.5
A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.
