Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from multiple buffer overflows within the British Telecommunications Consumer webhelper ActiveX control (btwebcontrol.dll).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the ActiveX control. These flaws occur when the control processes input, likely without proper bounds checking, leading to potential memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to:
* Execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious content.
* Cause Internet Explorer (or the program using the WebBrowser control) to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document. This could be a webpage, an HTML email, or an HTML attachment. The malicious HTML leverages the ActiveX control's vulnerabilities to trigger the overflow, enabling code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious HTML to the target user, either through a website the user visits, or by crafting a malicious email.
*   The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to the vulnerable system
*   The user needs to be using the vulnerable ActiveX control

**Additional Details (From CERT/CC):**
*   The vulnerable ActiveX control has a CLSID of `{EC5A4E7B-02EB-451D-B310-D5F2E0A4D8C3}`.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in version 2.0.0.8 of the control, but users who have already registered may not automatically get the updated version.
*   Workarounds include disabling the ActiveX control via a kill bit or disabling ActiveX controls entirely in Internet Explorer.

The information from CERT/CC provides more specific details on the vulnerable component, its CLSID, and workarounds compared to a typical CVE description.
