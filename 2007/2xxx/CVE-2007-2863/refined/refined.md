  "CVE-2007-2863": {
    "Description": "The Computer Associates Anti-Virus engine contains a stack-based buffer overflow in the code responsible for processing CAB archives. Specifically, the Computer Associates Anti-Virus engine fails to properly validate the size of the file names contained in CAB archives. This may allow a stack-based buffer overflow to occur.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a failure to properly validate the size of file names contained within CAB archives, which leads to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition on the affected system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through processing a specially crafted CAB archive with long filenames. An attacker could send a malicious CAB file to be scanned by the vulnerable antivirus engine.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send a specially crafted CAB archive to be processed by the vulnerable software.",
