Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2280:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the HP OpenView Storage Data Protector backup client service daemon (OmniInet.exe).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of long arguments to the 'MSG\_PROTOCOL' command.
- A stack buffer overflow occurs due to insufficient bounds checking of input data length when handling the long arguments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- The code execution occurs within the security context of the OmniInet.exe daemon process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over a network.
- The attack vector is through TCP port 5555, where the OmniInet.exe service listens.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable machine hosting the affected HP OpenView Storage Data Protector software.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network packets containing a specially crafted message to port 5555 that triggers the buffer overflow.
