Package: proftpd-mysql
Version: 1.3.0-19
Severity: grave

This is not really mysql related, but should apply to all proftpd sql
packages. I have the following configuration in my proftpd.conf:

SQLAuthTypes Crypt Plaintext
SQLAuthenticate users* groups*
SQLConnectInfo syscp@localhost syscp MYSQL_PASSWORD
SQLUserInfo ftp_users username password uid gid homedir shell
SQLGroupInfo ftp_groups groupname gid members
SQLUserWhereClause "login_enabled = 'y'"

One should think, a user who is defined in ftp_users should be able to
login with his password (which can be encrypted or not) and a
system-user should also be able to login. The first is perfectly true,
so is the second, BUT: a system-user is also able to login with ! or *
as password. ! or * in /etc/shadow indicates a bad password, so the
user shouldn't be able to login (this is done for the users www-data,
ftp, postfix, etc...) but proftpd seems to ignore that, if SQLAuthTypes
Plaintext is set and allows the user to login with ! or * as password
(whatever is set in /etc/shadow).

IMHO this is a grave security bug, because if someone enables plaintext
for SQL anyone can login with (guessable) system-accounts and do some
sh** :(

Of course that partially depends on your authoritative information choice.
If you added (disabled) system users to sql user table, that would not happen.
The same if you

- used the mod_sql as the only authoritative one
- added system users to ftpusers etc
- the system user shells are not listed /etc/shells and RequireValidShell is on

Anyway as a maintainer I agree that the rule of least surprise should
be apply.

PS:
Please enclose your complete proftpd.conf, sql and syslogs, and what
ever useful for tracking in any report.

Yepp, but why should I? They have disabled passwords, that should be
enough.

Maybe I need to login with some regular system-user? (I actually don't,
but this is an argument contra mod_sql only)

Uhm, mass-bug-filling against all packages which add users but don't
list them in ftpusers? ;-)

Also not really a solution, you know ;-)

I think the rule should be: don't apply settings of modA to modB and
be secure ;).
I bet it is not unusual to have a mixed environment of
system and virtual users who should be able to login without opening a
big fat door for the kiddies out there if you don't double and tripple
check the logins.

You can find the conf here:
<http://dragonheart.ath.cx/~zhenech/syscp/proftpd.etch>
SQL is empty and syslogs do not show anything interesting.

Some more information: the bug is also present in Sarges proftpd, so
seems kinda old :(
Hope you or upstream can fix it, even if it affects only "non-standard"
installs (you have to enable Plaintext :))

Evgeni

AFAIK, using "!" or "*" for "encrypted" passwords is just and only a
convention for indicating of disabled/locked accounts. The real meaning is,
that crypt() function will never produce any of those passwords, so there is
no password you can encrypt to get "!" or "*".

if you use "!" or "*" as plaintext passwords, OF COURSE you can log in using
"!" or "*".

So, the problem comes out of misunderstanding in using "special" passwords
and using plaintext passwords where encrypted passwords should be used.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c0)  TJ Saunders    2007-04-16 20:45:50 UTC  ``` Due to the way the FTP protocol requires separate USER and PASS commands, ProFTPD has to have separate lookups for the user data named by USER, and for the authentication of that user when PASS is received.  This, combined with the fact that ProFTPD allows multiple simultaneous auth modules to exist (e.g. mod_auth_unix, mod_sql, mod_ldap), makes it possible for one of those auth modules to provide user data (e.g. mod_auth_unix) but then another module to authenticate that user data (e.g. mod_sql).  This is very much a problem when an auth module, e.g. mod_sql, is configured to use a less strict authentication policy, such as:    SQLAuthTypes Plaintext  In this particular example, it means that mod_sql's "authenticate" handler will use a simple string comparison.  Combine that with user data supplied from, say, /etc/passwd, and allowing users to login that shouldn't be able to login becomes possible.  While such configurations should be heartily discouraged, this also demonstrates an interaction within ProFTPD's Auth API, by various auth modules, that is not clear or expected.  To fix this, the Auth API should remember which auth module supplied information for a given user, and then later, when asked to authenticate that user, *only* that module should be called. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c1)  TJ Saunders    2007-04-16 20:52:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2595](attachment.cgi?id=2595 "Fixes bug") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=2595&action=edit "Fixes bug") Fixes bug  This patch adds a specific sort of caching to the Auth API.  Whenever user data is retrieved using the pr_auth_getpwnam() function, the Auth API will store the module which returned the requested user information in a table, keyed by user name.  Later, when either pr_auth_authenticate() or pr_auth_check() are called, the Auth API will check to see if that table contains an entry for the user being authenticated.  If so, *only* that module's "authenticate" or "check" handlers will be used -- no other auth modules.  In effect, this means that the Auth API remembers which module provided data for a user, will then use only that module for authenticating that data.  Note that calls to pr_auth_endpwent() will clear the table of user name/supplier module associations. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c2)  Francesco Paolo Lovergine    2007-04-17 05:25:43 UTC  ``` Note that now auth.h and mod_auth.c declare both auth_sess_init() as static and non static, causing build failure. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c3)  TJ Saunders    2007-04-17 11:16:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2597](attachment.cgi?id=2597 "Fixes bug") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=2597&action=edit "Fixes bug") Fixes bug  Updates previous patch to avoid build warning/failure. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c4)  TJ Saunders    2007-04-17 17:22:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2598](attachment.cgi?id=2598 "Fixes bug") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=2598&action=edit "Fixes bug") Fixes bug  Make sure the cache table is not used outside of a session, i.e. that it is not used when proftpd is first starting up. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c5)  TJ Saunders    2007-04-17 17:34:34 UTC  ``` Patch committed to CVS. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c6)  Matthias Saou    2007-05-04 09:31:07 UTC  ``` This patch seems to be for 1.3.1rc. Would it be possible to have a backported version to 1.3.0a? ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c7)  SchAmane    2007-05-17 11:11:41 UTC  ``` This patch breaks PAM logins.  See <http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=178866> and <http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175082> ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c8)  TJ Saunders    2007-05-17 11:39:07 UTC  ``` Ugh.  Thanks. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c9)  Francesco Paolo Lovergine    2007-05-18 04:56:05 UTC  ``` Confirmed. See <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=421818> ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c10)  TJ Saunders    2007-05-18 11:03:30 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2634](attachment.cgi?id=2634 "Adds check using PAM, if present") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=2634&action=edit "Adds check using PAM, if present") Adds check using PAM, if present  This patch, to be used in addition to the prior patch, should re-add the check using PAM, prior to the stashed auth module that provided the user info, during authentication. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c11)  Francesco Paolo Lovergine    2007-05-19 13:09:07 UTC  ``` User reported the patch works ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c12)  TJ Saunders    2007-05-21 11:20:04 UTC  ``` PAM check patch committed to CVS. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c13)  Andrew Roberts    2007-06-12 13:26:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c12))  This patch breaks mod_ldap and mod_authfile when compiled with --enable-auth-pam=yes.  It may break other auth modules as well, but I haven't tested them. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c14)  TJ Saunders    2007-06-12 13:29:43 UTC  ``` Which patch, specifically?  There were two patches applied:    <http://bugs.proftpd.org/attachment.cgi?id=2598>   <http://bugs.proftpd.org/attachment.cgi?id=2634>  If there is an issue, after applying *both* patches, please provide logging information, configuration files, etc.  ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c15)  TJ Saunders    2007-06-12 14:56:08 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2643](attachment.cgi?id=2643 "Fixes typo in Auth API, for PAM check") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=2643&action=edit "Fixes typo in Auth API, for PAM check") Fixes typo in Auth API, for PAM check  This patch fixes a typo in this patch:    <http://bugs.proftpd.org/attachment.cgi?id=2634>  and fixes the Trace logging to be more accurate. ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c16)  Andrew Roberts    2007-06-12 15:39:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c15)) > Created an attachment (id=2643) [details] > Fixes typo in Auth API, for PAM check  Tests ok for me.  Thanks TJ. ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c17)  Matthias Saou    2007-06-19 14:03:28 UTC  ``` Sorry to ask the same question again, but since 1.3.0a is still the release considered "stable", would it be possible to have a backport of this patch for it?  This bug has been assigned CVE-2007-2165 and a "Medium" severity.  It's always a bit of a problem to have to choose between a release with known security issues and a release that the developers haven't dared tag as "final", usually for a good reason. ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c18)  TJ Saunders    2007-07-05 13:07:03 UTC  ``` Resolved in 1.3.1rc3. ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c19)  Roderik Muit    2008-05-13 10:01:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2816](attachment.cgi?id=2816 "Above 3 patches as one, for 1.3.0 branch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=2816&action=edit "Above 3 patches as one, for 1.3.0 branch") Above 3 patches as one, for 1.3.0 branch  As requested: 'backport'. Above 3 patches rolled into 1, with a slight change for 1.3.0. (I don't think you'll need it anymore, but since I was rolling it for myself anyway...) ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=2922#c20)  Roderik Muit    2008-05-13 11:04:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2817](attachment.cgi?id=2817 "Fixed patch to 1.3.0") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=2817&action=edit "Fixed patch to 1.3.0") Fixed patch to 1.3.0  OK, now everyone scream "try and use your own patches before uploading, stupid!" ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c0)  Ville Skyttä    2007-04-23 17:49:11 UTC  ``` <http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-2165> <http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2922>  "The Auth API in ProFTPD before 20070417, when multiple simultaneous authentication modules are configured, does not require that the module that checks authentication is the same as the module that retrieves authentication data, which might allow remote attackers to bypass authentication, as demonstrated by use of SQLAuthTypes Plaintext in mod_sql, with data retrieved from /etc/passwd."   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c1)  Matthias Saou    2007-06-15 15:41:11 UTC  ``` Still no backport of the patch to the stable 1.3.0a release. It's pretty annoying, since the patch against the latest RC doesn't apply cleanly because of variable name changes. I tried to backport it, but the risk in _me_ doing so is just too high.  I really don't understand how/why projects decide to not provide security patches for what they consider to be the current stable release... I'm going to push new proftpd packages anyway, to fix [bug #244168](show_bug.cgi?id=244168 "CLOSED ERRATA - proftpd pam problem") but not this bug, unfortunately :-(   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c2)  Matthias Saou    2007-08-19 16:22:21 UTC  ``` Still no patches backported to 1.3.0a, so I've at least pushed 1.3.1rc3 to devel (F8) since it fixes all know vulnerabilities, and should be more than stable enough for inclusion. Maybe later backporting it to all current releases would make sense...   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c3)  Kevin Fenzi    2007-09-14 00:11:55 UTC  ``` Any further news here?  Also, if the 1.3.1rc3 is working fine in devel, would you consider pushing to epel? or is it too disruptive going from 1.3.0a to 1.3.1rc3?    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c4)  Matthias Saou    2007-10-09 17:51:22 UTC  ``` I've updated devel to 1.3.1 final, now that it's out. I don't think updating from 1.3.0 to 1.3.1 is too disruptive, but I'm not sure it won't break on some complex setups...   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c5)  Matthias Saou    2007-10-22 14:37:17 UTC  ``` I've had no reports of any problems with 1.3.1, so I'll push it in F-7 testing updates. If everything looks good once it's there, then it should be possible to push it to stable.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c6)  Fedora Update System    2007-10-24 07:05:04 UTC  ``` proftpd-1.3.1-2.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 testing repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.  If you want to test the update, you can install it with   su -c 'yum --enablerepo=updates-testing update proftpd'   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c7)  Fedora Update System    2007-11-05 15:10:57 UTC  ``` proftpd-1.3.1-2.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c8)  Lubomir Kundrak    2007-11-05 15:57:16 UTC  ``` Reopening for Werewolf.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c9)  Matthias Saou    2008-02-03 17:37:08 UTC  ``` I'm confused. The package in F-7 updates has been newer than that one in F-8 for ages, and I haven't received any nag mails about it. Still they're all 1.3.1, so the security fix is included. Nevertheless, I'll be pushing 1.3.1-3 as an F-8 update.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c10)  Kevin Fenzi    2008-02-03 17:41:38 UTC  ``` How about also updating EPEL-5 too? It has version 1.3.0a still...    ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c11)  Matthias Saou    2008-02-03 17:47:25 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c10)) > How about also updating EPEL-5 too? > It has version 1.3.0a still...   Ouch, you're absolutely right! I'll do that now. I still can't reproduce the EL-4 build failure from [bug #250223](show_bug.cgi?id=250223 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Please build proftpd for EPEL 4 and 5") on my machine, so I think I'll give up on EL-4 proftpd, though.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c12)  Matthias Saou    2008-02-03 18:12:58 UTC  ``` Both EL-5 and EL4 build fine, so those are updated too now.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=237533#c13)  Fedora Update System    2008-07-30 20:09:51 UTC  ``` proftpd-1.3.1-3.fc8 has been pushed to the Fedora 8 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
