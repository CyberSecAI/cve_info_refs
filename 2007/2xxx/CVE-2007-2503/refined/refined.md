Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `$GLOBALS['tcore']` variable in the `user/turbulence.php` script of PHP Turbulence 0.0.1 alpha. This variable is directly used in an `include()` statement, allowing for file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include and execute remote files by manipulating the `$GLOBALS['tcore']` parameter. This is possible when `allow_url_include` is enabled in the PHP configuration.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Attackers can also exploit the vulnerability to include local files by using directory traversal sequences (`../`) in the `$GLOBALS['tcore']` parameter when `register_globals` is on.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the RFI vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** LFI exploitation could expose sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, user data, or even system files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `user/turbulence.php` script.
*   The attacker manipulates the `GLOBALS[tcore]` parameter in the URL to specify either a remote URL (for RFI) or a local file path (for LFI).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   For RFI, the `allow_url_include` setting must be enabled in the PHP configuration of the server.
*   For LFI, the `register_globals` setting needs to be enabled.
*   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is disputed because the `tdb_connect` function is not defined, causing the script to exit prematurely with a fatal error before reaching the vulnerable `include()` statement in some situations, making exploitation challenging.
* The vulnerability is associated with both CVE-2007-2503 and CVE-2007-2504, and the provided information suggests that both of them refer to the same issue in the script.
