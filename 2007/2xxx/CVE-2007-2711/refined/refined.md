  "related": true,
  "details": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the processing of incoming ident requests. Specifically, the server does not properly check the length of the data sent by the client, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory by sending a large string in the USERID field.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Lack of Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can be exploited to achieve remote code execution. By carefully crafting the overflowed data, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, redirecting execution flow to attacker-controlled code.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through network interaction, by sending a specially crafted message to the target application's ident port (113).",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable service via network. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability."
