### Content from exploit-db.com:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `search.php` file. Specifically, the `$_REQUEST['search']` parameter is directly embedded into an SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows for arbitrary SQL code injection through the `search` parameter in `search.php`.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The code mentions that multiple parameters including the `search` parameter are vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries to retrieve sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and password hashes. In this specific case, the exploit targets the retrieval of admin credentials.
- **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts to redirect users, steal cookies, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the `search.php` file. An attacker injects SQL code through the `search` parameter in the URL.
- Additionally, several other files (`browseCat.php`, `browseSubCat.php`, `openTutorial.php`, `topFrame.php`, `admin/editListing.php`) are also mentioned as vulnerable to SQL injection and other parameters to XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
-  The attacker does not need prior authentication to the target system to exploit the SQL injection.
- Magic Quotes GPC needs to be set to off for the SQL injection to work.
