## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)

## Details

The compat\_sys\_mount function allowed local users to cause a denial of

service when mounting a smbfs filesystem in compatibility mode.

([CVE-2006-7203](/security/CVE-2006-7203))

The Omnikey CardMan 4040 driver (cm4040\_cs) did not limit the size of

buffers passed to read() and write(). A local attacker could exploit

this to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. ([CVE-2007-0005](/security/CVE-2007-0005))

Due to a variable handling flaw in the ipv6\_getsockopt\_sticky()

function a local attacker could exploit the getsockopt() calls to

read arbitrary kernel memory. This could disclose sensitive data.

([CVE-2007-1000](/security/CVE-2007-1000))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that Bluetooth setsockopt calls could leak

kernel memory contents via an uninitialized stack buffer. A local

attacker could exploit this flaw to view sensitive kernel information.

([CVE-2007-1353](/security/CVE-2007-1353))

A flaw was discovered in the handling of netlink messages. Local

attackers could cause infinite recursion leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2007-1861](/security/CVE-2007-1861))

A flaw was discovered in the IPv6 stack's handling of type 0 route

headers. By sending a specially crafted IPv6 packet, a remote attacker

could cause a denial of service between two IPv6 hosts. ([CVE-2007-2242](/security/CVE-2007-2242))

The random number generator was hashing a subset of the available

entropy, leading to slightly less random numbers. Additionally, systems

without an entropy source would be seeded with the same inputs at boot

time, leading to a repeatable series of random numbers. ([CVE-2007-2453](/security/CVE-2007-2453))

A flaw was discovered in the PPP over Ethernet implementation. Local

attackers could manipulate ioctls and cause kernel memory consumption

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2525](/security/CVE-2007-2525))

An integer underflow was discovered in the cpuset filesystem. If mounted,

local attackers could obtain kernel memory using large file offsets

while reading the tasks file. This could disclose sensitive data.

([CVE-2007-2875](/security/CVE-2007-2875))

Vilmos Nebehaj discovered that the SCTP netfilter code did not correctly

validate certain states. A remote attacker could send a specially

crafted packet causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2876](/security/CVE-2007-2876))

Luca Tettamanti discovered a flaw in the VFAT compat ioctls on 64-bit

systems. A local attacker could corrupt a kernel\_dirent struct and

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2878](/security/CVE-2007-2878))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* linux-image-2.6.17-12-mckinley
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-powerpc64-smp
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-hppa32
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-hppa64
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-sparc64-smp
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-generic
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-powerpc-smp
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-386
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-server-bigiron
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-itanium
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-powerpc
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-sparc64
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39
* linux-image-2.6.17-12-server
  -
  2.6.17.1-12.39

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the Ubuntu 6.10 kernel updates

have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you

use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to

get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually

uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (linux-386, linux-powerpc,

linux-amd64-generic, etc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## IPv6 Type 0 Route Headers allow sender to control routing

#### Vulnerability Note VU#267289

Original Release Date: 2007-06-01 | Last Revised: 2011-07-22

---

### Overview

IPv6 Type 0 Route Headers allow the sender to control packet routing. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to cause a denial-of-service condition.

### Description

| Routing header options provided by IPv6 allow packet senders to indicate specific nodes through which the packet should travel. Note that a node is defined as any device that implements IPv6, which includes hosts as well as routing devices. According to [FreeBSD-SA-07:03.ipv6](http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-07%3A03.ipv6.asc):  *An attacker can "amplify" a denial of service attack against a link between two vulnerable hosts; that is, by sending a small volume of traffic the attacker can consume a much larger amount of bandwidth between the two vulnerable hosts.**An attacker can use vulnerable hosts to "concentrate" a denial of service attack against a victim host or network; that is, a set of packets sent over a period of 30 seconds or more could be constructed such that they all arrive at the victim within a period of 1 second or less.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| This condition can facilitate a number of different impacts including packet amplification, bypassing filtering devices, denial of service, and defeating IPv6 Anycast. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**  See the systems affected portion of this document for information about updates for specific vendors. |

Notified:  May 09, 2007  Updated: June 15, 2007

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Sidewinder G2, Sidewinder 7, and TSP: Not Vulnerable

By default, Sidewinder ignores routing header 0, and strips it from datagrams
passing through the firewall.

TSP drops IPv6 datagrams containing routing headers.

SnapGear: Vulnerable

SnapGear products at version 3.1.5 and earlier honor IPv6 routing header 0.
This will be corrected in an upcoming release.

This vulnerability is not relevant to any other Secure Computing products.

### Vendor Information

We are not aware of further vendor information regarding this vulnerability.

### [Sun Microsystems, Inc.](#MIMG-732S3J) Affected

Notified:  May 09, 2007  Updated: May 17, 2007

**Statement Date:   May 16, 2007**

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Sun can confirm that while Solaris has support for the IPv6 Routing Header type 0 that is described in VU#267289, packets containing this header extension are discarded by default on Solaris 9 and 10, and Solaris 8 can be configured to discard them by setting a kernel driver parameter.

For Solaris systems, this setting is controlled by the ip6\_forward\_src\_routed kernel driver parameter, which defaults to 1 on Solaris 8 systems, and 0 on later systems. The 'ndd(1M)' command can be used to set this variable, for example to set it for the current session the command could be used as follows:

# ndd -set /dev/ip ip6\_forward\_src\_routed 0

More details are available from the following blog post:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-508-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

31 August 2007

Linux kernel vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [linux-source-2.6.15](/security/cves?package=linux-source-2.6.15) -

## Details

A buffer overflow was discovered in the Moxa serial driver. Local

attackers could execute arbitrary code and gain root privileges.

([CVE-2005-0504](/security/CVE-2005-0504))

A flaw was discovered in the IPv6 stack's handling of type 0 route headers.

By sending a specially crafted IPv6 packet, a remote attacker could cause

a denial of service between two IPv6 hosts. ([CVE-2007-2242](/security/CVE-2007-2242))

A flaw in the sysfs\_readdir function allowed a local user to cause a

denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer. ([CVE-2007-3104](/security/CVE-2007-3104))

A buffer overflow was discovered in the random number generator. In

environments with granular assignment of root privileges, a local attacker

could gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2007-3105](/security/CVE-2007-3105))

It was discovered that certain setuid-root processes did not correctly

reset process death signal handlers. A local user could manipulate this

to send signals to processes they would not normally have access to.

([CVE-2007-3848](/security/CVE-2007-3848))

It was discovered that the aacraid SCSI driver did not correctly check

permissions on certain ioctls. A local attacker could cause a denial

of service or gain privileges. ([CVE-2007-4308](/security/CVE-2007-4308))

### Reduce your security exposure

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-386,

linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a standard system upgrade will

automatically perform this as well.

1) Problem Description and Brief Discussion
The Linux kernel contained various security problems for which we
released updates.
This round of updates covers kernels for following product families:
- SUSE Linux Enterprise 10
- SUSE Linux 10.1
- openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
This kernel update fixes the following security problems:
CVE-2008-0007: Insufficient range checks in certain fault handlers
could be used by local attackers to potentially read or write kernel
memory. (all)
CVE-2008-0001: Incorrect access mode checks could be used by local
attackers to corrupt directory contents and so cause denial of service
attacks or potentially execute code. (all) Please note that this
problem does not affect SLES 9 or SLES 8.
CVE-2007-5966: Integer overflow in the hrtimer\_start function in
kernel/hrtimer.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.23.10 allows local
users to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (panic)
via a large relative timeout value. (all)
CVE-2007-3843: The Linux kernel checked the wrong global variable
for the CIFS sec mount option, which might allow remote attackers to
spoof CIFS network traffic that the client configured for security
signatures, as demonstrated by lack of signing despite sec=ntlmv2i
in a SetupAndX request. (openSUSE 10.2, 10.3)
CVE-2007-2242: The IPv6 protocol allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service via crafted IPv6 type 0 route headers
(IPV6\_RTHDR\_TYPE\_0) that create network amplification between two
routers. A non-kABI breaking patch has now been applied to all
product trees.
CVE-2007-6417: The shmem\_getpage function (mm/shmem.c) in Linux kernel
2.6.11 through 2.6.23 does not properly clear allocated memory in some
rare circumstances, which might allow local users to read sensitive
kernel data or cause a denial of service (crash). (all)
CVE-2007-4308: The (1) aac\_cfg\_open and (2) aac\_compat\_ioctl functions
in the SCSI layer ioctl path in aacraid in the Linux kernel did not
check permissions for ioctls, which might have allowed local users
to cause a denial of service or gain privileges. (openSUSE 10.2)
CVE-2007-3740: The CIFS filesystem, when Unix extension support is
enabled, does not honor the umask of a process, which allows local
users to gain privileges. (openSUSE 10.2)
CVE-2007-3848: The Linux kernel allowed local users to send
arbitrary signals to a child process that is running at higher
privileges by causing a setuid-root parent process to die, which
delivers an attacker-controlled parent process death signal
(PR\_SET\_PDEATHSIG). (openSUSE 10.2)
CVE-2007-4997: Integer underflow in the ieee80211\_rx function in
net/ieee80211/ieee80211\_rx.c in the Linux kernel allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted SKB length
value in a runt IEEE 802.11 frame when the IEEE80211\_STYPE\_QOS\_DATA
flag is set, aka an "off-by-two error." (openSUSE 10.2)
CVE-2007-6063: Buffer overflow in the isdn\_net\_setcfg function in
isdn\_net.c in the Linux kernel allowed local users to have an unknown
impact via a crafted argument to the isdn\_ioctl function. (openSUSE
10.2)
A failed AppArmor change\_hat system call can result in an apparmored
task becoming unconfined (326546). (openSUSE 10.2)
Also quite a number of non-security bugs were fixed.
The openSUSE 10.3 kernel update was reissued twice, the second time
to fix a regression with CPU Frequency handling on Laptops.
2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Reboot the machine after the update was installed.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
Online Update (YOU) tool. YOU detects which updates are required and
automatically performs the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
There are two verification methods that can be used independently from
each other to prove the authenticity of a downloaded file or RPM package:
1) Using the internal gpg signatures of the rpm package
2) MD5 checksums as provided in this announcement
1) The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
2) If you need an alternative means of verification, use the md5sum
command to verify the authenticity of the packages. Execute the command
md5sum <filename.rpm>
after you downloaded the file from a SUSE FTP server or its mirrors.
Then compare the resulting md5sum with the one that is listed in the
SUSE security announcement. Because the announcement containing the
checksums is cryptographically signed (by security@suse.de), the
checksums show proof of the authenticity of the package if the
signature of the announcement is valid. Note that the md5 sums
published in the SUSE Security Announcements are valid for the
respective packages only. Newer versions of these packages cannot be
verified.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

* **001: SECURITY FIX: March 25, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  A race condition has been reported to exist in the handling by sendmail of
  asynchronous signals. A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
  privileges of the user running sendmail, typically root. This is the second revision of
  this patch.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/001_sendmail.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: May 2, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    A security vulnerability has been found in the X.Org server --
    [CVE-2006-1526](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1526).
    Clients authorized to connect to the X server are able to crash it and to execute
    malicious code within the X server.

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/002_xorg.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: June 15, 2006**
        *All architectures*

      A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A malformed MIME
      message could trigger excessive recursion which will lead to stack exhaustion.
      This denial of service attack only affects delivery of mail from the queue and
      delivery of a malformed message. Other incoming mail is still accepted and
      delivered. However, mail messages in the queue may not be reattempted if a
      malformed MIME message exists.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/003_sendmail2.patch)

      * **004: SECURITY FIX: July 30, 2006**
          *All architectures*

        [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/httpd.8)'s
        mod\_rewrite has a potentially exploitable off-by-one buffer overflow.
        The buffer overflow may result in a vulnerability which, in combination
        with certain types of Rewrite rules in the web server configuration files,
        could be triggered remotely. The default install is not affected by the
        buffer overflow. CVE-2006-3747

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/004_httpd.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          A potential denial of service problem has been found in sendmail. A message
          with really long header lines could trigger a use-after-free bug causing
          sendmail to crash.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/005_sendmail3.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            Due to an off-by-one error in
            [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/dhcpd.8),
            it is possible to cause
            [dhcpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/dhcpd.8)
            to exit by sending a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32-byte client identifier option.
            [CVE-2006-3122](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3122)

            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/006_dhcpd.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                *All architectures*

              It is possible to cause the kernel to panic when more than the default number of
              semaphores have been allocated.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/007_sem.patch)

              * **008: SECURITY FIX: August 25, 2006**
                  *All architectures*

                A problem in
                [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/isakmpd.8)
                caused IPsec to run partly without replay protection. If
                [isakmpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/isakmpd.8)
                was acting as responder during SA negotiation, SA's with a replay window of size 0 were created.
                An attacker could reinject sniffed IPsec packets, which will be accepted without checking the
                replay counter.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/008_isakmpd.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: September 2, 2006**
                    *All architectures*

                  Due to the failure to correctly validate LCP configuration option lengths,
                  it is possible for an attacker to send LCP packets via an
                  [sppp(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/sppp.4)
                  connection causing the kernel to panic.
                  [CVE-2006-4304](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4304)

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/009_sppp.patch)

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: September 8, 2006**
                      *All architectures*

                    Two Denial of Service issues have been found with BIND.
                    An attacker who can perform recursive lookups on a DNS server and is able
                    to send a sufficiently large number of recursive queries, or is able to
                    get the DNS server to return more than one SIG(covered) RRsets can stop
                    the functionality of the DNS service.
                    An attacker querying an authoritative DNS server serving a RFC 2535
                    DNSSEC zone may be able to crash the DNS server.
                    [CVE-2006-4095](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4095)
                    [CVE-2006-4096](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4096)

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/010_bind.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: September 8, 2006**
                        *All architectures*

                      Due to incorrect PKCS#1 v1.5 padding validation in OpenSSL, it is possible for
                      an attacker to construct an invalid signature which OpenSSL would accept as a
                      valid PKCS#1 v1.5 signature.
                      [CVE-2006-4339](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4339)

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/011_openssl.patch)

                      * **012: SECURITY FIX: October 7, 2006**
                          *All architectures*

                        [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/httpd.8)
                        does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when it is
                        reflected back in an error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS)
                        style attacks.
                        [CVE-2006-3918](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3918)

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/3.9/common/012_httpd2.patch)

                        * **013: SECURITY FIX: October 7, 2006**
                            *All architectures*

                          Several problems have been found in OpenSSL. While parsing certain invalid ASN.1
                          structures an error condition is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite
                          loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function. A NULL
                          pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
                          applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
                          public keys being used.
                          [CVE-2006-2937](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2937),

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1
=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-07:03.ipv6 Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: IPv6 Routing Header 0 is dangerous
Category: core
Module: ipv6
Announced: 2007-04-26
Credits: Philippe Biondi, Arnaud Ebalard, Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino
Affects: All FreeBSD releases.
Corrected: 2007-04-24 11:42:42 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.2-STABLE)
2007-04-26 23:42:23 UTC (RELENG\_6\_2, 6.2-RELEASE-p4)
2007-04-26 23:41:59 UTC (RELENG\_6\_1, 6.1-RELEASE-p16)
2007-04-24 11:44:23 UTC (RELENG\_5, 5.5-STABLE)
2007-04-26 23:41:27 UTC (RELENG\_5\_5, 5.5-RELEASE-p12)
CVE Name: CVE-2007-2242
I. Background
IPv6 provides a routing header option which allows a packet sender to
indicate how the packet should be routed, overriding the routing knowledge
present in a network. This functionality is roughly equivalent to the
"source routing" option in IPv4. All nodes in an IPv6 network -- both
routers and hosts -- are required by RFC 2460 to process such headers.
II. Problem Description
There is no mechanism for preventing IPv6 routing headers from being used
to route packets over the same link(s) many times.
III. Impact
An attacker can "amplify" a denial of service attack against a link between
two vulnerable hosts; that is, by sending a small volume of traffic the
attacker can consume a much larger amount of bandwidth between the two
vulnerable hosts.
An attacker can use vulnerable hosts to "concentrate" a denial of service
attack against a victim host or network; that is, a set of packets sent
over a period of 30 seconds or more could be constructed such that they
all arrive at the victim within a period of 1 second or less.
Other attacks may also be possible.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
NOTE WELL: The solution described below causes IPv6 type 0 routing headers
to be ignored. Support for IPv6 type 0 routing headers can be re-enabled
if required by setting the newly added net.inet6.ip6.rthdr0\_allowed sysctl
to a non-zero value.
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE, or 6-STABLE, or to the
RELENG\_6\_2, RELENG\_6\_1, or RELENG\_5\_5 security branch dated after the
correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.5, 6.1,
and 6.2 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-07:03/ipv6.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-07:03/ipv6.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch.
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

---

* **001: SECURITY FIX: November 4, 2006**
    *All architectures*

  [httpd(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/httpd.8)
  does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when it is
  reflected back in an error message, which might allow cross-site scripting (XSS)
  style attacks.
  [CVE-2006-3918](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3918)

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/001_httpd.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: November 4, 2006**
      *All architectures*

    Several problems have been found in OpenSSL. While parsing certain invalid ASN.1
    structures an error condition is mishandled, possibly resulting in an infinite
    loop. A buffer overflow exists in the SSL\_get\_shared\_ciphers function. A NULL
    pointer may be dereferenced in the SSL version 2 client code. In addition, many
    applications using OpenSSL do not perform any validation of the lengths of
    public keys being used.
    [CVE-2006-2937](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2937),
    [CVE-2006-3738](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3738),
    [CVE-2006-4343](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4343),
    [CVE-2006-2940](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2940)

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/002_openssl.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: November 4, 2006**
        *All architectures*

      Fix for an integer overflow in
      [systrace(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/systrace.4)'s
      STRIOCREPLACE support, found by
      Chris Evans. This could be exploited for DoS, limited kmem reads or local
      privilege escalation.

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/003_systrace.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: November 7, 2006**
          *All architectures*

        Due to a bug in the
        [arc(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/arc.4)
        RAID driver the driver will not properly synchronize the cache to the logical volumes
        upon system shut down. The result being that the mounted file systems within the logical
        volumes will not be properly marked as being clean and fsck will be run for the subsequent
        boot up.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/004_arc.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: November 19, 2006**
            *All architectures*

          The ELF
          [ld.so(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/ld.so.1)
          fails to properly sanitize the environment. There is a potential localhost security
          problem in cases we have not found yet. This patch applies to all ELF-based
          systems (m68k, m88k, and vax are a.out-based systems).

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/005_ldso.patch)

          * **006: FTP DISTRIBUTION ERROR: December 4, 2006**
              *All architectures*

            The **src.tar.gz** and **ports.tar.gz** archives
            released on FTP were created incorrectly, a week after the 4.0 release. The
            archives on the CD sets are correct; this only affects people who downloaded
            them from a [mirror](ftp.html).

            The archives have been corrected. The correct MD5 of
            [ports.tar.gz](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.0/ports.tar.gz) is eff352b4382a7fb7ffce1e8b37e9eb56, and for
            [src.tar.gz](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.0/src.tar.gz) it is b8d7a0dc6f3d27a5377a23d69c40688e.

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: January 3, 2007**
                *i386 only*

              Insufficient validation in
              [vga(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/vga.4)
              may allow an attacker to gain root privileges if the kernel is compiled with
              `option PCIAGP`
              and the actual device is not an AGP device.
              The `PCIAGP` option is present by default on i386
              kernels only.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/i386/007_agp.patch)

              * **008: RELIABILITY FIX: January 16, 2007**
                  *All architectures*

                Under some circumstances, processing an ICMP6 echo request would cause
                the kernel to enter an infinite loop.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/008_icmp6.patch)

                * **009: INTEROPERABILITY FIX: February 4, 2007**
                    *All architectures*

                  A US daylight saving time rules change takes effect in 2007.

                  [A source code patch exists which syncs the timezone data files with tzdata2007a](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/009_timezone.patch).

                  * **010: SECURITY FIX: March 7, 2007**
                      *All architectures*

                    **2nd revision, March 17, 2007**

                    Incorrect mbuf handling for ICMP6 packets.

                    Using
                    [pf(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.0/pf.4)
                    to avoid the problem packets is an effective workaround until the patch
                    can be installed.

                    Use "block in inet6" in /etc/pf.conf

                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/010_m_dup1.patch)

                    * **011: SECURITY FIX: April 4, 2007**
                        *All architectures*

                      Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in X.Org.

                      XC-MISC extension ProcXCMiscGetXIDList memory corruption vulnerability,
                      BDFFont parsing integer overflow vulnerability,
                      fonts.dir file parsing integer overflow vulnerability,
                      multiple integer overflows in the XGetPixel() and XInitImage functions
                      in ImUtil.c.
                      [CVE-2007-1003](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1003),
                      [CVE-2007-1351](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1351),
                      [CVE-2007-1352](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1352),
                      [CVE-2007-1667](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1667).

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/011_xorg.patch)

                      * **012: SECURITY FIX: April 23, 2007**
                          *All architectures*

                        IPv6 type 0 route headers can be used to mount a DoS attack against
                        hosts and networks. This is a design flaw in IPv6 and not a bug in
                        OpenBSD.

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/012_route6.patch)

                        * **013: STABILITY FIX: April 26, 2007**
                            *PowerPC*

                          An unhandled AltiVec assist exception can cause a kernel panic.

                          * **014: STABILITY FIX: May 9, 2007**
                              *All Architectures*

                            A malicious client can cause a division by zero.

                            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/014_xorg.patch)

                            * **015: SECURITY FIX: July 9, 2007**
                                *All Architectures*

                              Fix possible heap overflow in file(1), aka CVE-2007-1536.

                              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.0/common/015_file.patch)

                                Malicious DHCP clients could cause dhcpd(8) to corrupt its stack

                                A DHCP client that claimed to require a maximum message size less than
                                the minimum IP MTU could cause dhcpd(8) to overwrite stack memory.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
