  "CVE-2007-2788": {
    "description": "The Sun Java Runtime Environment contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that may allow an attacker to execute code or read local files. A buffer overflow vulnerability in the image parsing code in the Java Runtime Environment may allow an untrusted applet or application to elevate its privileges.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the ICC parser used with JPG or BMP files. The ICC parser takes several 32-bit integers from the ICC profile data and does not check them for being excessively large, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (JVM crash) by enticing a user to run a specially crafted Java class or applet that will trigger the vulnerability. An attacker may also be able to read or write files and execute code with the privileges of the user running the JRE.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote, unauthenticated attack by convincing a user to open a website that hosts a specially crafted Java applet.",
         "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted image, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Emul-linux-x86-java. They also could entice a user to open a specially crafted BMP image, resulting in a Denial of Service. Note that these vulnerabilities may also be triggered by a tool processing image files automatically."
    ],
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to host a malicious applet on a website or send a malicious file to a user. The attacker needs to have a specially crafted image (JPEG or BMP).",
        "additional_details": "This vulnerability is related to CESA-2006-004. The vulnerability exists in the native code of the ICC parser used by the JRE for image processing, especially when handling embedded ICC profiles in JPG or BMP files. A related vulnerability involves an incorrect open() call to /dev/tty when processing certain BMP files."
