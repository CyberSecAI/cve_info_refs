Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `auth_method` parameter in several PHP files within the `admin` directory of MobilePublisherphp v1.1.2. The application directly includes the content of this parameter via `require $abspath."/functions.php";` which leads to remote file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `auth_method` parameter before using it in a `require` statement. This allows an attacker to include remote files or scripts by manipulating this parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By including a malicious script from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- **Full System Compromise:** If the injected script gains sufficient privileges, it could lead to complete control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker manipulates the `auth_method` parameter in the URL of vulnerable PHP files, such as `index.php`, `list.php`, `postreview.php`, `reindex.php`, `sections.php`, `templates.php`, `userinfo.php`, `users.php`, and `view.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** Understanding of URL manipulation and remote file inclusion is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No Authentication Needed:** The exploit does not require any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present before the product is fully installed. After installation, `config.php` is loaded which defines the `$auth_method` variable.
- The `header.php` file in the root directory contains the vulnerable code.
- The vulnerability was previously found by Timq.
- The exploit locations are given as:
```
