```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the dynamic update code (update.c) of MyDNS. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when handling remote update requests. An additional stack based off-by-one overflow also exists in the same file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Heap-based buffer overflow in update.c when handling the rr->rdlength field, specifically when parsing DNS update requests.
  - Stack-based off-by-one overflow in update.c related to the handling of variable length fields in the DNS update query parsing.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - Remote attackers can crash the MyDNS daemon, leading to a denial of service.
  - Successful exploitation of the heap overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Attack vectors:
  - Sending specially crafted malicious remote update requests to the MyDNS server.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the server on the DNS port (typically 53).
  - The attacker must target a mydns server where allow-update = yes is set in `/etc/mydns.conf`, and be able to spoof requests from an IP allowed to perform updates.
