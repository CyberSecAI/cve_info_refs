Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `format_menue` parameter in `admin/inc/change_action.php` and `admin/inc/add.php` files of PHPGlossar version 0.8.
*   The application directly includes the content of the parameter using PHP's `include()` function: `<?PHP include ("$format_menue");?>`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability. The application includes a file path specified by the user through the `format_menue` parameter, without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting a URL pointing to a malicious PHP script in the `format_menue` parameter, an attacker can force the server to execute arbitrary code. This gives the attacker full control over the compromised webserver.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to either `admin/inc/change_action.php` or `admin/inc/add.php`, embedding the malicious URL in the `format_menue` parameter.
    *   Example URLs provided:
        *   `http://site.com/path/admin/inc/change_action.php?format_menue=[[Sh3LL Script]]`
        *   `http://site.com/path/admin/inc/add.php?format_menue=[[Sh3LL Script]]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `format_menue` parameter is vulnerable and can be used to include remote files.
