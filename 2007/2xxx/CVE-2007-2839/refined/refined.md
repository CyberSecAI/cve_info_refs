Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2839
*   **Description:** The `gfax` package, a GHOME frontend for fax programs, uses temporary files insecurely.

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the unsafe manner in which `gfax` handles temporary files.

**Weaknesses:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The application creates temporary files in a predictable manner which makes them susceptible to symlink attacks, race conditions, or other insecure access patterns.

**Impact:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the root user. This means an attacker could gain full control over the system if the application is run with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attacker must be able to execute commands on the local system.
*   **Exploitation of Insecure Temp Files:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload and places it where `gfax` expects to create a temporary file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to execute commands on the target machine.
*   **Knowledge of `gfax`'s temp file handling:** The attacker needs to be aware of how `gfax` creates and uses temporary files to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Versions:**
* Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 (sarge) is vulnerable, and the fix is provided in `gfax` version `0.4.2-11sarge1`.
* Debian stable distribution (etch) and unstable distribution (sid) are not affected.

**Mitigation:**

*   Users of the vulnerable version of `gfax` on Debian Sarge should update their packages to `0.4.2-11sarge1` or later.

This vulnerability is a classic example of an insecure temporary file handling issue that can be used for privilege escalation.
