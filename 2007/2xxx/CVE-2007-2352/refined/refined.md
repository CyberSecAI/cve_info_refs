    {
      "cve": "CVE-2007-2352",
      "root_cause": "Multiple format string vulnerabilities exist due to command-line arguments being directly passed as format strings to the `err()` and `warn()` functions without proper sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Format String Vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker who can control command-line parameters passed to affected AFFLIB utilities can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code. This is especially critical if the affected binaries are setuid/setgid or if executed in vulnerable contexts like CGI scripts.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through command-line arguments passed to vulnerable AFFLIB utilities.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to influence command-line arguments passed to the vulnerable utilities.  This could be direct execution if the attacker has access to a command line interface or indirectly, such as via a CGI script.",
