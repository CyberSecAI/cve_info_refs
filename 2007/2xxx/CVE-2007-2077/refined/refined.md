- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The script `search.php` in Maian Search v1.1 is vulnerable to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The `$path_to_folder` variable, which is intended to define the base directory of the script, can be manipulated by an attacker using the `path_to_folder` GET parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsanitized user-supplied input is used in an `include` statement, allowing for remote file inclusion.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server using the `path_to_folder` GET parameter, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing a path to a remote file in the `path_to_folder` parameter of the `search.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and host the malicious file on a publicly accessible server. The vulnerable web server must have `allow_url_include` set to `true` in php.ini, or a similar configuration that allows remote file inclusion.
