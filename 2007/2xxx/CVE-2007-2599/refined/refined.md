Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2599:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary root cause is a **SQL injection vulnerability** present in the TutorialCMS script, specifically in version 1.00. The vulnerability arises from unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The script directly uses user-supplied input from the `search` parameter in `search.php` without proper sanitization or escaping when constructing the SQL query. The vulnerable code snippet is:
    ```php
    $search = $_REQUEST['search'];
    $sql    = "SELECT * FROM tutorials WHERE title LIKE '%$search%' 
    ORDER BY hits DESC LIMIT $startID , $perPage";
    ```
*   Multiple files and parameters were vulnerable:
    *   `browseCat.php?catFile=[SQL QUERY]`
    *   `browseSubCat.php?catFile=[SQL QUERY]`
    *   `openTutorial.php?id=[SQL QUERY]`
    *   `search.php?search=[SQL QUERY]`
    *   `topFrame.php?id=[SQL QUERY]`
    *   `admin/editListing.php?id=[SQL QUERY]`
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The same parameters vulnerable to SQL injection are also vulnerable to XSS, as mentioned in the exploit code comment:
     `NOTE: All above parameters are vulnerable to XSS, so try:  search.php?search="><script>alert('http://www.w4ck1ng.com')</script>`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach/Manipulation:**  Successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to:
    *   Retrieve sensitive database information, including usernames and password hashes.
    *   Modify data within the database (not demonstrated in the provided exploit, but is a general risk of SQLi).
    *   Potentially gain administrative access if user credentials can be retrieved.
*  **XSS:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the affected pages, which could lead to a variety of attacks against the users of the site, such as session hijacking, redirection, defacement, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:**  The primary attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable PHP scripts, especially `search.php`. The attacker injects malicious SQL code within the `search` parameter. The provided exploit uses the following payload:
    `search.php?search=' UNION SELECT 0,0,0,0,username,password,0,0,password,0,password,0,0 FROM users WHERE id='1' /*`
*   Other vulnerable files could be targeted via URL parameters.
*   **XSS:** Parameters are vulnerable to XSS through crafted HTTP GET requests

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable TutorialCMS application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
*  **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker must understand SQL to craft successful injection payloads.
*  **magic_quotes_gpc:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `magic_quotes_gpc` php setting being set to off in order to use this attack.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by `Silentz`
*   The provided exploit specifically targets the retrieval of admin usernames and hashes from the `users` table.
*   The exploit code is written in Perl.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.01 where SQL-injection issues were fixed.
*   Version 1.02 fixed register\_globals security issue.
*   The `search.php` file is specifically mentioned as vulnerable, but other files like `browseCat.php`, `browseSubCat.php`, `openTutorial.php`, `topFrame.php` and `admin/editListing.php` are also listed as vulnerable to SQL Injection, with all of the mentioned parameters being vulnerable to XSS.
