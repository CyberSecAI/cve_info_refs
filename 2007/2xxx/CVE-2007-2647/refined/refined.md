```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the `admin_configuration.php` script of Monalbum 0.8.7. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by manipulating POST parameters, specifically the 'gcfgBase' parameter, which is then used to construct and write to the `config.inc.php` file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Unvalidated user-controlled input: The `$_POST['gcfgBase']` parameter is directly inserted into a string that is then written to a file, allowing for code injection.
    - File overwrite: The `config.inc.php` file is overwritten with the attacker's crafted content.
    - Lack of input sanitization/validation: The script does not sanitize or validate the input from POST parameters before using it to construct the configuration file, making it vulnerable to injection attacks.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Remote code execution: By injecting malicious PHP code into the `config.inc.php` file, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server when that file is accessed.
    - Full system compromise: Successful exploitation could lead to a complete takeover of the vulnerable server.
- Attack vectors:
    - HTTP POST request: Attackers send a crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin/admin_configuration.php` file.
    - Parameter manipulation: The `gcfgBase` parameter is manipulated to include malicious PHP code.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Network access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server to send HTTP requests.
    - No prior authentication is needed
