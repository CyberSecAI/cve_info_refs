```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The script `theme/acgv.php` includes a file based on the `$rubrik` variable, which is not properly initialized. This allows an attacker to control the included file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application is vulnerable because it includes files based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization or validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure (e.g., reading `/etc/passwd`) or other malicious activities depending on the server configuration and accessible files.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL with the `rubrik` parameter to include a local file. For example: `/theme/acgv.php?rubrik=../../../etc/passwd%00`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable application. No special capabilities or position is necessary."
