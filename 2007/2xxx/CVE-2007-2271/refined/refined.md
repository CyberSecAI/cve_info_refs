  "CVE-2007-2271": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the `download.php` script, which directly uses user-supplied input (`dnld` parameter) to construct file paths without proper sanitization or validation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Path Traversal",
         "Insufficient Input Validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially gaining access to sensitive data such as configuration files, system files (e.g., /etc/passwd), or other confidential information.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `download.php` script. By manipulating the `dnld` parameter, an attacker can specify a path to an arbitrary file on the server.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are required."
