Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of insufficiently sanitized variables `$doc_root` and `$DOCUMENT_ROOT` in `localize.php` and `config.php` files of the affected application. These variables are used to construct file paths for inclusion via the `include` statement.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The application directly incorporates files based on user-controlled or predictable server-side variables (`$doc_root` and `$DOCUMENT_ROOT`). If an attacker can manipulate these variables, they can force the application to include and execute malicious code from a remote location or from other locations on the server.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the values of `$doc_root` and `$DOCUMENT_ROOT` before using them in `include` statements. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including malicious code, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the same permissions as the web server user.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive data stored on the server or connected databases.
*   **Server Compromise:** In a worst-case scenario, the attacker could gain full control of the compromised server.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could also modify the website's content, leading to defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Variable Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `$doc_root` and `$DOCUMENT_ROOT` variables. The exact method of manipulation isn't detailed in the provided text, but would typically involve exploiting a vulnerability that allows an attacker to control these variables. This could include manipulating HTTP parameters or exploiting a different vulnerability to overwrite variable values server side.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to somehow control the values of the `$doc_root` and `$DOCUMENT_ROOT` variables before the application includes the files.  This could be achieved via another vulnerability or perhaps by exploiting a predictable default or misconfiguration.
*  The attacker needs to host a malicious file for inclusion, either remotely or locally (if the attacker can influence the filesystem to host the malicious file).

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided text references a milw0rm exploit (now defunct) which would likely contain further details and proof-of-concept exploits.
* The FRSIRT advisory mentioned may contain more information as well
* There are two distinct attack vectors (doc_root and DOCUMENT_ROOT) which may indicate multiple places where the attacker can inject a malicious path.
