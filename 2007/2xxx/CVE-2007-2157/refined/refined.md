Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2157:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a remote file disclosure issue in the `force_download.php` script of Zomplog v3.8. The script does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `file` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is path traversal, also known as directory traversal. The script fails to properly validate or sanitize the `file` parameter, allowing attackers to use sequences like `../` to navigate outside the intended directory and access files elsewhere on the server.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  The `force_download.php` script does not implement sufficient input validation or sanitization on the 'file' parameter, making it susceptible to path traversal attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server. This can include configuration files, source code, database credentials, or any other file the web server has access to. This can lead to further attacks or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `force_download.php` script, with the malicious file path in the `file` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker must know the location of the `force_download.php` script and the parameter it utilizes (`file`).

**Exploit Example:**

The exploit example provided in the content is:

```
http://[Target]/[Path]/upload/force_download.php?file=../../../etc/passwd
```
This shows how an attacker could attempt to read the `/etc/passwd` file using path traversal.
