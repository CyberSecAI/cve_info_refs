Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2573:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** issue found in the `cms2.php` file of PHPtree version 1.3.
*   The `s_dir` parameter within `cms2.php` is vulnerable, allowing an attacker to include remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unvalidated Input:** The application fails to properly validate user input provided through the `s_dir` parameter.
*   **Remote File Inclusion:** The lack of input validation allows for the inclusion of arbitrary remote files, which can be located on an attacker controlled server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include and execute malicious PHP code from a remote server on the vulnerable system. This enables arbitrary code execution, potentially giving the attacker full control over the web server, its data, and other resources accessible from it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the vulnerable `cms2.php` file and the `s_dir` parameter, pointing to a remote malicious script.
*   Example: `http://site.com/[phptree_path]/plugin/HP_DEV/cms2.php?s_dir=shell.txt?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Control over a Remote Server:** The attacker needs to have a server where they can host their malicious PHP script which will be included by the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Application:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `cms2.php` file and the vulnerable parameter (`s_dir`).

**Additional Notes:**

* The exploit is verified by Exploit-DB.
* The vulnerability was discovered on 2007-05-05 by ThE TiGeR.
* The vulnerable software is PHPtree version 1.3.
