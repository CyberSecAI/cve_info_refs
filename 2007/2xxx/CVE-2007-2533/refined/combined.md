1. Overview of this Security Patch Release
========================================================================

AgRpcCln.dll) have buffer overflow defects that can be exploited
remotely using RPC. These defects allow attackers to run malicious
code on the system account.

2. What's New
========================================================================
2.1 Resolved Known Issues (From previous versions)
=====================================================================
2.1.1 The following vulnerability issues are fixed in this build:
RPC call to function CMON\_NetTestConnection (in module stcommon.dll)
has buffer overflow issue.
RPC call to RPCFN\_ActiveRollback (in module stcommon.dll) has buffer
overflow issue.
RPC call to function ENG\_SetRealTimeScanConfigInfo (in module eng50.dll)
has buffer overflow issue.
RPC call to function ENG\_SendEmail (in module eng50.dll) has buffer
overflow issue.
RPC call to RPCFN\_EVENTBACK\_Online (in module earthagent.exe) has
buffer overflow issue.
Function CreateBinding in AgRpcCln.dll has buffer overflow issue.
2.1.2 Virus log has an increased file name length limit (previously
86 characters). The limit has been extended to the maximum Windows can
support.
2.1.3 When ServerProtect performs manual pattern duplication from AU
server, the earthagent.exe process may use too many socket resources.
Now the maximum socket resource usage is around 250.
3. Documentation Set
========================================================================
o Readme.txt -- basic installation, known issues
Electronic versions of the printed manuals are available at:
http://www.trendmicro.com/download
4. System Requirements
========================================================================
No special requirements for installing this security patch.
5. Installation/Un-installation
========================================================================
1. Copy the spnt\_558\_win\_en\_securitypatch2.exe to a temporary folder
on the ServerProtect Information Server.
2. Make sure that the ServerProtect Management Console is not running.
3. Execute spnt\_558\_win\_en\_securitypatch2.exe and follow the
instructions to install the Quarterly Patch. The Information Server
will deploy the Quarterly Patch to NT Normal Servers 30 seconds
after installation is complete, and then it will restart
ServerProtect services.
If after the deployment you want to roll back to the original
files, you can find the backup files with extension name "bak" in
the ServerProtect home directory. To restore, just rename the
backup files to the original filename. Before you can roll back,
issue the following shell commands to stop all ServerProtect services:
net stop spntsvc
net stop earthagent
net stop "TrendMicro Infrastructure"
After rollback is done, issue the following commands to start
ServerProtect services:
net start spntsvc
net start earthagent
net start "TrendMicro Infrastructure"
Note: If the installation fails or if it does not complete
successfully, check the TMPatch.log under the system root and
contact Trend Micro technical support for troubleshooting.
Refer to section 9 for contact information.
Note: Trend Micro recommends that you update your scan engine and
virus pattern files immediately after installing the product.
Note: Register online with Trend Micro within 30 days of installation
to continue downloading new pattern files and product updates from the
Trend Micro Web site. Register during installation, or online at:
http://olr.trendmicro.com/
6. Post-Installation Configuration
========================================================================
For known issue 2.1.2, remove old spntlog.dbf and spntLog.cdx files
to make the enhancement take effect. Stop spntsvc service is needed
before remove these two files.
7. Known Issues
========================================================================
a. Close the Management console before applying the Quarterly Patch
otherwise the patch installation will fail.
b. Do not install ServerProtect Normal server and an OSCE client on
the same machine.
c. After this patch is applied, the pattern update progress bar shown
may not accurately reflect the actual progress.
