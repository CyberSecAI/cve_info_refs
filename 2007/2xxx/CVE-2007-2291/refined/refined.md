Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Internet Explorer (IE) 7 and Firefox browsers handle Digest Authentication when the username contains carriage return (`\r`) or newline (`\n`) characters (or their URL-encoded representation, `%0d%0a`). This allows an attacker to inject additional HTTP headers or even a second HTTP request into the authentication exchange.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Request Splitting:** The core issue is that the browsers fail to properly sanitize the username field when constructing the `Authorization` header for Digest Authentication. By including `\r\n` (or `%0d%0a`), an attacker can insert arbitrary headers or even a new request after the `Authorization` header.
*   **Digest Authentication Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is specifically tied to Digest Authentication and the way browsers process usernames during this process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **HTTP Request Smuggling:** The attacker can inject a second request, potentially bypassing security measures, accessing restricted resources, or performing other malicious actions.
*   **Proxy Cache Poisoning:** In the presence of a proxy server, an attacker can poison the proxy cache by injecting a manipulated request, causing the proxy to serve malicious content to other users.
*   **Arbitrary Header Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers, potentially leading to further security issues depending on the application logic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Authentication:** Embedding a malicious URL with a crafted username containing `\r\n` within an `<img>` tag or similar elements. For example:
    ```html
    <img src="http://user%0aname:pp@evilhost/req.php">
    ```
*   **Redirection:** Using a redirector to redirect to a URL with a crafted username containing `\r\n`.
*   **XMLHttpRequest:** Using XMLHttpRequest with a crafted username, e.g. `x.open("POST","req.php?",false,"user\r\nname","pass");`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control a URL:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a URL or a page that will trigger the vulnerable behavior in the user's browser. This can be done through a malicious website, a link in an email, or other similar methods.
*   **Target is using Digest Authentication:** The targeted web server must be configured to use Digest Authentication.
*   **Proxy (optional but enhances attack):** While the vulnerability can be exploited without a proxy, the presence of a proxy allows for more powerful attacks like cache poisoning.
*  **No requirement for man in the middle position**: The attack can occur client side in the browser.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Internet Explorer 7 was not vulnerable through direct URL authentication but was vulnerable when using XMLHttpRequest.
*   Safari is also vulnerable to this issue.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Stefano Di Paola.
*  The provided text includes an example of a vulnerable php script that returns a 401 to prompt the digest authentication, and returns a poisoned page when authenticated.
