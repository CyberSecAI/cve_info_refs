Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-2301:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `arashlib_dir` parameter of multiple PHP files within the `audioCMS arash 0.1.4` application. This allows for Remote File Inclusion (RFI).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application fails to adequately validate or sanitize the `arashlib_dir` parameter before using it in file inclusion operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include remote files, potentially leading to:
    - Arbitrary code execution on the server by including malicious code hosted elsewhere.
    - Data compromise through execution of malicious code to gain access to sensitive information or databases.
    - Server takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests that manipulate the `arashlib_dir` parameter in the following vulnerable files:
   - `arash_lib/include/edit.inc.php`
   - `arash_lib/include/list_features.inc.php`
   - `arash_lib/class/arash_gadmin.class.php`
   - `arash_lib/class/arash_sadmin.class.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and must have access to a remote location hosting a malicious file for inclusion. The attacker does not need any prior access to the system or special privileges beyond making standard HTTP requests.

**Summary:**
This vulnerability allows for Remote File Inclusion (RFI) due to insecure handling of the `arashlib_dir` parameter in multiple `audioCMS arash 0.1.4` PHP files. By injecting a malicious URL into the parameter, an attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, resulting in complete system compromise.
