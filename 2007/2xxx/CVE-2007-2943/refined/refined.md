{
  "CVE-2007-2943": {
    "Description": "Webavis 0.1.1 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI) via the 'root' parameter in class.php.",
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input to the 'root' parameter in the class.php file, allowing an attacker to include remote files.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with the 'root' parameter pointing to a malicious file on an attacker-controlled server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable web application and have a publicly accessible server to host the malicious file."
