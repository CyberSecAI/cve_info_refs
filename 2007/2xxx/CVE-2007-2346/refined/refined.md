Root cause of vulnerability:
The `$_APP_RELATIVE_PATH` variable is not declared before being used in `include_once` statements within the vulnerable files. Also, no configuration file is available to define this variable's value.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation:
- An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

Attack vectors:
- By manipulating the `_APP_RELATIVE_PATH` parameter in the URL of the vulnerable PHP files (include.php, /dbcommon/include.php, /exception/include.php).

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
