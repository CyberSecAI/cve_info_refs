How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

IBM Trusteer analyzes devices on several levels. Device attributes are reviewed and checked for spoofing and abnormalities. Devices are then checked for malware before being scanned for other cybercriminal tools
such as emulators, screen overlays and remote access tools.

Network information is crucial in determining the risk associated with a potential fraudulent activity. Trusteer checks for the location, carrier or hosting service while also detecting whether a VPN is being used or a call is in progress on the device because these are common social engineering techniques.

Behavior of a user can be assessed by looking at behavioral biometrics such as swipes, keystrokes, mouse movements, session length and more. These can be compared to previous user sessions and flagged if discrepancies are detected.

Data relating to the user’s accounts can be key in determining whether a cybercriminal is performing fraudulent activities. Transactional data such as amounts, targeted accounts and transactional types alongside account opening data can be analyzed and used to prevent funneling of funds to criminals.

IBM Trusteer employs a team of world-class threat experts that constantly monitor the dark web to identify emerging threats and devise ways to detect them. In addition, they tap into a global intelligence network of millions of devices across 190 countries by using a unique and persistent fingerprint for every device.

## BIND version 8 generates cryptographically weak DNS query identifiers

#### Vulnerability Note VU#927905

Original Release Date: 2007-08-28 | Last Revised: 2007-08-28

---

### Overview

ISC BIND version 8 generates cryptographically weak DNS query IDs which could allow a remote attacker to poison DNS caches.

### Description

| The [Berkeley Internet Name Domain](http://www.isc.org/sw/bind/) (BIND) is a popular Domain Name System (DNS) implementation from [Internet Systems Consortium](http://www.isc.org/) (ISC). Version 8 of the BIND software uses a weak algorithm to generate DNS query identifiers. This condition allows an attacker to reliably guess the next query ID, thereby allowing for DNS cache poisoning attacks.  ISC states that this bug only affects outgoing queries, generated by BIND 8 to answer questions as a resolver, or when it is looking up data for internal uses, such as when sending NOTIFY messages to slave name servers. Note that although this vulnerability is similar in nature and impact to [VU#252735](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/252735), it is a distinct issue. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker with the ability to predict DNS query IDs and respond with arbitrary answers, could poison DNS caches. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade or apply a patch**Users should obtain a patch from their operating system vendor when available. Please see the Systems Affected section of this document for more information about specific vendors.Users who compile their own versions of BIND 8 from the original ISC source code are encouraged to take the following actions described by ISC:This issue is addressed in ISC BIND 8.4.7-P1, available as patch that  can be applied to BIND 8.4.7.The more definitive solution is to upgrade to BIND 9. BIND 8 is being  declared "end of life" by ISC due to multiple architectural issues.  See ISC's website at <http://www.isc.org> for more information and  assistance. |
