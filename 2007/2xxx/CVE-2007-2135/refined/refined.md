Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `ADI_BINARY` component of the Oracle E-Business Suite.
*   Specifically, the component exposes a parameter that can be passed to `ADI_DISPLAY_REPORT`, which allows an attacker to access and view documents stored in the `APPS.FND_DOCUMENTS` table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to directly access and download arbitrary documents by manipulating the document ID parameter. There's no access control to prevent this.
*   **Lack of Authentication:**  Exploitation of the vulnerability doesn't require any prior authentication, making it easier for attackers to exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Document Download:** A remote attacker can download any existing document stored in the `APPS.FND_DOCUMENTS` table. This could include sensitive information, business documents, configuration files, or other confidential data.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive data may lead to a breach of confidentiality and potentially further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **Direct Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can directly manipulate a parameter exposed by the `ADI_BINARY` component to access the documents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instance.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTTP Requests:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to manipulate the vulnerable parameter.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection against this vulnerability with Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '4924'.
*   Oracle has released an update to fix this issue as part of their Critical Patch Update in April 2007.
