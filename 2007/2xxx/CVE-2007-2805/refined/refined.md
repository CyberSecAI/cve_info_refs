- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Input passed to the "ticketID", "view", and "fuse" parameters in "index.php" is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session within the context of the affected site.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attacker injects malicious code via the vulnerable parameters in the `index.php` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameters that will be accessed by a user.
