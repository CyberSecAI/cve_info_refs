Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2007-2756 from the provided documents:

**CVE-2007-2756: Infinite loop in libpng processing in PHP (specifically when calling gd functions via php-gd)**

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from an infinite loop within the `gdPngReadData()` function of the GD library, specifically when processing truncated (incomplete) PNG files. This is triggered through the `imagecreatefrompng()` function within PHP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Infinite Loop:** The core weakness is an infinite loop triggered by malformed PNG files. When the function encounters a truncated PNG image, it gets stuck in a loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The main impact is a denial of service. By providing a specially crafted, truncated PNG file to a PHP application using the vulnerable `gdImageCreateFromPng()` function (via `imagecreatefrompng` in PHP), an attacker can cause the application to become unresponsive and potentially consume excessive CPU resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely if an application processes PNG files from untrusted sources. An attacker needs to find a PHP application that directly or indirectly processes uploaded or linked PNG images.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a malformed PNG image to a vulnerable PHP application or otherwise trigger processing of such an image on the server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** An attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability in the image processing function and use a truncated PNG file to exploit it.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   **Affected Components:** The issue is primarily within the GD library, specifically the `gd_png.c` file.
*  **Specific function:** The vulnerable function is `gdPngReadData()`.
*   **PHP versions:** Affects multiple PHP versions prior to the fix (e.g. versions prior to 5.2.3). Some documents indicated PHP version 5.2.3 fixes this vulnerability.
*   **Libpng Impact:** The vulnerability is also listed as being within `libpng` specifically its function `png_read_info()`.
*   **Operating systems:** Various Linux distributions, such as Gentoo, Ubuntu, and Red Hat, and their respective derivitives were affected and required patches.
*   **Red Hat:** Several Red Hat security advisories address this vulnerability, alongside other PHP security issues (e.g., RHSA-2007:0889, RHSA-2007:0890, RHSA-2007:0891, RHSA-2008:0146).
*  **Gentoo:** Gentoo also addresses this vulnerability in their security advisory GLSA 200708-05, which is GD library focused. It is also mentioned as being bundled with other vulnerable code in CSTeX, which resulted in a security advisory GLSA 200711-34 for CSTeX.
*  **Ubuntu:** This vulnerability is also addressed in Ubuntu security notice USN-473-1.

**Summary of impact:** A specially crafted PNG file can cause the program to enter an infinite loop and thus create a DoS.

The provided documents indicate that the vulnerability is addressed by updating the PHP and GD libraries to the patched versions.
