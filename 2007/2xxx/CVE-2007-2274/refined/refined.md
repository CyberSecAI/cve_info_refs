- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A malformed torrent file can cause a denial-of-service vulnerability in Opera's built-in BitTorrent client. Specifically, a crafted torrent file triggers a memory leak leading to high CPU usage and ultimately a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak, denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability leads to a denial of service, causing the Opera browser to consume 100% CPU and crash, disrupting normal user operation.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote. The attack is triggered by opening a specially crafted .torrent file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide the victim with a malicious .torrent file, which when opened by the vulnerable version of Opera, will cause the crash.
