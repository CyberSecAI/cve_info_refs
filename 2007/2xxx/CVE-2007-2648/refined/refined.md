```
1.  **Root cause of vulnerability:**
    - A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the "ConnectToDatabase" method of the Clever Database Comparer ActiveX control.

2.  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Buffer overflow.

3.  **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Allows arbitrary code execution on the user's computer.

4.  **Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability is triggered by calling the "ConnectToDatabase" method with an overly long input string, leading to a buffer overflow when the string is copied into a fixed-size buffer. This can be done remotely through a web page using the vulnerable ActiveX component.

5.  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to visit a malicious web page that uses the vulnerable ActiveX component or otherwise make the user execute the vulnerable ActiveX component with malicious input.
