How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

=== Content from www.aczoom.com_065588cb_20250124_113314.html ===
2.7.0 September 23, 2012:
\* Now with IPV6 support. This is preliminary, not fully tested yet.
blockhosts.cfg changed to allow for IPv6 indicators, HOST\_BLOCKLINE replaced with:
#HOST\_BLOCKLINE\_IPv4 = ["ALL: ", " : deny"]
#HOST\_BLOCKLINE\_IPv6 = ["ALL: [", "] : deny"]
\* Minor updates to support Ubuntu, logwatch files updated.
\* Removed bhrss.py, the RSS feed of blocked addresses was not really that useful.
2.6.0 June 18, 2011:
\* Python strptime problem. On some systems, fails to read time written
by strftime on same system, get this error:
ValueError: time data '2011-06-16 10:46:10 WEST' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'
Code changed to not rely on Python time.strptime anymore, uses epoch UTC
number of seconds now. The orignal reason for using strftime was to show
human readable date/time in hosts.allow. That is still done, but in
hosts.allow comments only.
See bug report in: http://www.aczoom.com/forums/blockhosts/mar-10-151801-domains-blockhosts5599-error-failed-to-parse-date-for-ip-18911419951#comment-5386
Example hosts.allow lines now:
#--------- IP Address :count: epoch secs # local time ------------
#bh: ip: 10.141.193.46 : 8 : 1308341273.0 # 2011-06-17 16:07:53 EDT
#bh: ip: 10.102.213.133 : 2 : 1308341245.0 # 2011-06-17 16:07:25 EDT
2.5.1 March 18, 2011:
\* Packaging problem - running bdist\_rpm on newer systems inserts a hard
dependency "python(abi) = 2.6" for this noarch package, which creates
unnecessary problems. So, for now moved back to creating installer on
older machines where bdist\_rpm does not add that line. Just a workaround
for now to fix the problems reported by multiple users.
Installing from source always works, bdist\_rpm is touch and go.
\* Change blockfile time parsing failure from Log.Error to Log.Warning,
since using default time (start of blockhosts.py execution) is fine,
and warning is sufficient to indicate that something is wrong in blockfile.
\* tests updated: test\_all.log with duplicate IP but different PID
2.5.0 August 14, 2010:
\* Added config variable for IGNORE\_DUPLICATES - to try to detect when
multiple log messages actually refer to a single failed login attempt.
IGNORE\_DUPLICATES is now turned off by default. It has been improved
with this update, but even then, the danger is that a false positive
for a duplicate means that a failed login attempt goes uncounted.
So, even though it works better now, by default, this is disabled.
Can be enabled in the blockhosts.cfg config file, search for
IGNORE\_DUPLICATES in that file for more information.
\* dovecot-LoginFailRip rule added, for dovecot.
Note that dovecot is not enabled by default, see ENABLE\_RULES
in .cfg or command line --enable-rules option.
\* make a call to setlocale at the start, to allow for \w to match
accented characters (seen in syslog month printing), etc
\* bhrss.py update: remove xml.dom.ext since it is no longer available,
and use xml.dom.minidom.toprettyxml instead of xml.dom.ext.PrettyPrint
\* removed very old config file example: test\_data/test\_v203.cfg
2.4.0 May 17, 2008:
\* iptables chains are now inserted at the beginning of INPUT chain,
this will handle the case when the site has a default policy
of DROP (and it will continue to still work if the default policy is
ACCEPT).
http://www.aczoom.com/forums/blockhosts/iptables-firewall-and-blockhosts
has a brief discussion on this.
\* Fix commented line in /etc/blockhosts.cfg - previously, uncommenting
it would have caused problems, correct way to enable all rules:
#ENABLE\_RULES = r'.\*' # use this to enable all rules
2.3.1 January 14, 2008:
\* Log matches now allow the : after [pid] to be optional.
Received report from a Debian (etch) log, which does not print
a colon after the [pid], so modified LOG\_PREFIX to handle optional :
after the [pid].
Also saw similar log lines in a ubuntu forum.
2.3.0 December 27, 2007:
\* added patterns to handle reported Source Mage GNU/Linux log files,
probably from metalog (syslog replacement)
\* added support for keywords in blockhosts.cfg to make rules easier
to write:
{LOG\_PREFIX{service-name}} and {HOST\_IP}
\* logwatch scripts updated to include blacklist activity
2.2.0 December 15, 2007:
\* logwatch scripts added - these will get installed if the
/etc/logwatch/... directories exist on the system. On systems
where logwatch is setup to send summary emails, now blockhosts
summaries will be included.
\* --mail will now send mail if there are any error/warnings/notices
in the log output, otherwise no email will be sent.
Removed MAIL\_LOG\_MESSAGES configuration option from blockhosts.cfg,
it is not necessary - if email has to be sent, it will include
all text from the log output (log level is controlled by --verbose,
--debug, --quiet)
\* --check-ip will be removed in a future release, since the new
Notice logging level handles printing out newly blocked and
expired host ip addresses and --mail has been modified to send
email on such activity.
\* blockhosts.cfg -> All rules names now follow this pattern:
servicename-word as pattern for id, with no "-" dash in final word,
examples: "ftpd-Solaris", "postfix-smtpdInvalidHostname"
2.1.1, 2.1.2, November 10, 2007:
\* replaced the --iptables and --iproute options with:
--ipblock=iptables and --ipblock="ip route" respectively. Can
optionally accept full path for iptables or ip commands, example:
--ipblock=/sbin/iptables or --ipblock="/sbin/ip route"
This allows full path to be specified, useful for cron jobs where
/sbin may not be in the PATH environment variable.
\* added try/except for re.compile when using BLACKLIST or WHITELIST
user-provided regular expressions
\* handle blockfile with invalid time - assume time of now. Ex:
#bh: ip: 10.171.123.83 : 6 : 2007-11-06 08:39:41 EST
is how a EST system might look like, but if someone copies over
a hosts.allow from a different system, say with PST, etc, then
the EST system Python strptime call may fail - this is now handled as a
non-fatal error by assigning time of now if date parsing fails
\* using new regex for IP\_STR matches - tighter than earlier pattern.
Not really needed since strict IP matching is not really necessary.
#old IP\_STR = r"(::ffff:)?(?P\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})"
#new IP\_STR = r"(::ffff:)?(?P(2[0-4]\d|25[0-5]|1?\d\d?)(\.(2[0-4]\d|25[0-5]|1?\d\d?)){3})"
2.1.0, September 30, 2007:
\* Based on multiple requests for whitelist and blacklist support, even
though these can be done using hosts.allow or rc.local with iptables/route
commands, have now added this support directly in blockhosts to make
it easier to manage such lists.
Lists can be specified to force particular IP addresses to be
never blocked (whitelist), or to be immediately blocked (blacklist).
The lists contain IP addresses or regular expressions representing IP
addresses.
See the blockhosts.cfg as well as --help for the --blacklist and
--whitelist options.
\* Re-organized the code - with so many different ways available to
filter the suspect IP addresses, created a uniform interface to easily
add newer methods to take (blocked, watched) lists and manipulate it as
needed. This could be used in future to add more and more filtering
options, and use a plugin mechanism, and make the list of filters
user-controllable. The BHUpdatePlugins class enables this.
\* added rules for postfix/smtpd authentication failures, but these
are not enabled by default in blockhosts.cfg
2.0.6, September 18, 2007:
\* Handle the case where the first line in the log file has spaces at end,
example:
#bh: first line:Sep 16 07:33:32 bombay5 su: pam\_keyinit(su-l:session): Unable to change UID back to 0
Because of the trailing space character, blockhosts.py failed to
recognize the log file as having been previously processed, and on
each run would re-scan full log file. This nly occurs if the first line
in the watched log files (/var/log/secure, messages, etc) has
trailing space characters.
\* Minor edits to the email subject line, and log messages on removing
expired address now indicate if removed address was blocked or watched
\* Added rule for Postfix-550, forum posting:
http://www.aczoom.com/forums/blockhosts/help-with-postfix-rule-please
2.0.5, June 24, 2007:
\* Send email when hosts expire off the watched list also
\* Add option --enable-patterns and config corresponding keyword
ENABLE\_PATTERNS to allow rules to be enabled/disabled on the fly
\* Expanded VSFTPD-Fail pattern to recognize lines that contain the
word "vsftpd", for example lines like:
Jun 23 17:03:04 servername vsftpd[25249]: Sat Jun 23 15:03:04 2007 [pid 25249] [anonymous] FAIL LOGIN: Client "10.102.1.8"
\* On EAGAIN error for lockfile, indicating another instance of
blockhosts is running, don't print FATAL ERROR, since all it means is
that another instance is doing all the work.
So a info level message is now printed, seen with --verbose or --debug
\* Source kit now includes the test script test\_blockhosts.py and
supporting test data files in test\_data/ directory.
2.0.4, June 7, 2007:
\* Fixed all regexs, based on log injection analysis at this site:
http://www.ossec.net/en/attacking-loganalysis.html
Changes protect against log injection that force blockhosts to block
any arbitrary IP address.
\* moved email notification after iptables/iproute is done, so that data
is included in email message
2.0.3, May 17, 2007:
\* fixed invalid Error message when --iptables is on. It is not an error
when the command to create chain is run multiple times.
This was only a message issue, program was setting iptables correctly.
\* fixed Solaris ftpd pattern in blockhosts.cfg
\* fixed log scanning: changed .\*? to .\* in appropriate patterns.
Bug allowed remote attackers to add arbitrary hosts to the blocked list
and cause a denial of service. Demonstratable by logging in to ssh
using a login name containing certain strings with an IP address
Similar issue as this: http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2006-6301
\* added rule for Qpopper POP3 server access failures
This is commented out by default, so needs to be manually enabled
in config file blockhosts.cfg.
\* added LICENSE file to RPM package, updated setup.cfg
\* removed P from regular expressions, it was not used at all
2.0.2, April 1, 2007:
\* ALL\_REGEX\_STRS are now read from the config file - no longer embedded
in the code. Therefore, blockhosts.cfg is now required, not optional.
This also makes it easy to turn on/off all the patterns, helpful since
the list of patterns has grown large.
Other than SSH/FTP log checks, all other patterns are now commented
out, so should be re-enabled in blockhosts.cfg if needed.
\* mail messages can now include the log statements, see MAIL\_LOG\_MESSAGES
boolean flag in blockhosts.cfg
\* copied requirements to clarify that extended version of hosts access
control language as described in man hosts\_options is required for
using hosts.access/hosts.deny control methods - copied this to INSTALL
file from blockhosts.py
\* (2.0.0) Old ALL\_REGEX renamed to ALL\_REGEX\_STRS for configuration - no
need to prefix with re.compile(, just provide raw string in that dict
\* "Charaoui, Jerome"  sent in Proftpd log
lines that don't have a : after the PID, so updated the rules to
make : optional after the PID
\* handle error return from iproute/iptables commands
\* fixed bug in config file LOCKFILE handling - should be accepted in the
blockhosts section, not in common section
\* added rule for Solaris 10 ftpd failures
2.0.1, March 4, 2007:
\* cleaned up TCP/IP Blocking options - now called --iproute and
--iptables to be clearer as to their intent
--ipdrop no longer available, this is replaced by --iproute
\* removed previously deprecated bhmail.py script, use
--mail option for same functionality in blockhosts.py
\* made all time/format/constants to be class variables of main Config
class instead of module globals
\* message level options (--verbose, --debug, --quiet, etc) can now be
set in the config file using the VERBOSE key
2.0.0, March 3, 2007:
\* NOTE: blockhosts.cfg now updated with some incompatible changes, so
will need manual merge for any locally modified blockhosts.cfg file
\* blockhosts now has direct support for email notification, see
--mail option
\* added null routing and ip tables packet filtering functionality, this
will enable blocking protection for all services, not just TCP
WRAPPERS enabled services. See options
--ipdrop
--iptables
\* Removed the --block (BLOCK\_SERVICES) option, a more general way to
define the lines to add to hosts.allow or other block files is
available by using the HOST\_BLOCKLINE configuration in the config file
\* Configuration file is now required, either the default file
(/etc/blockhosts.cfg) or the one specified in the --config option
must be readble by blockhosts.py
\* added bhrss.py script to provide RSS feeds of currently blocked
address, as well as addresses just being watched:
http://....../cgi-bin/bhrss.py [to get all blocked]
http://....../cgi-bin/bhrss.py?q=watching [to get all blocked as well as watched addresses]
\* removed use of datetime module, now using the basic time module, which
handles local time zones as expected, unlike datetime.
\* change time display format in block file (hosts.allow) to follow ISO
format - YY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
old time format will be supported for reading in (used when new
version is first run)
\* deprecated the script bhmail.py, it will go away in a future release
since the --mail option supports all that functionality
1.1.0, February 19, 2007:
\* added bhmail.py helper script to send email on newly blocked IP, with
list of all currently blocked addresses
\* re-arranged config file /etc/blockhosts.cfg - now includes global
section, and separate sections for blockhosts.py and bhmail.py
\* added (::ffff:)? before all P matches in regular expressions
\* add the blocked IP address sorted by date added, newest first
\* add rule to block Dovecot IMAP/POP3 server failures, previously had
also added rule to block ipop3d login failures, and PureFTPD failures
1.0.7, January 2, 2007:
\* problem with shipped example blockhosts.cfg - need line 126 to have
four spaces in front of the curly brace closing ALL\_REGEX
1.0.6, January 1, 2007:
\* added RPM package back, using workaround mentioned in the BlockHosts forum:
add this line to /etc/rpm/macros:
%\_unpackaged\_files\_terminate\_build 0
Also added logrotate file to distribution install to /etc/logrotate.d
1.0.5, December 27, 2006:
\* Not including noarch.rpm with this release - the scripts that used to
work, no longer work, and from searching on the web, this may be
a distutils/rpmbuild interaction problem. For now, use the non-RPM
install instructions to install this program, INSTALL has details.
Ref: http://www.mail-archive.com/distutils-sig@python.org/msg02536.html
But the fix mentioned in that email thread did not fix blockhosts rpm
build.
\* Expanded SSHD-Invalid regexp: got new form of a log line - has [ID] in it,
now able to catch this:
Oct 4 12:04:50 hostname.host.net sshd[1110]: [ID 800047 auth.info] Illegal user slime from 10.10.102.101
\* Fixed bug: --ignore-offset was not being acted upon
\* Fixed bug: exception when blockfile is not update-able -
update\_hosts\_blockfile, around line 705:
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'fp' referenced before assignment
Now, if blockfile (usually /etc/hosts.allow) cannot be written to,
prints appropriate message.
\* Added logrotate configuration, in case verbose logging to
/var/log/blockhosts.log is being used, also updated INSTALL file to
point out that it is not necessary to use verbose logging, the minimal
logging using syslog (which usually goes to /var/log/messages) is
enough. File added to distribution is called: logrotate
This is courtesy of an email from Santeri P., with some modifications.
1.0.4, February 18, 2006:
\* Make P optional in the regexs, match a PID group only if it is
necessary to restrict matches to IP-PID unique keys and not just IP
For example, SSHD uses the PID to ignore duplicate log line matches
from the same SSHD process.
But for VSFTPD, which uses a single process and allows any number of
login failures in one connection, each log line should be counted even
though the PID is the same for those log lines.
\* Added comment about how using tcpd wrappers for VSFTPD is not really
helpful since vsftpd allows unlimited password attempts on a single
connection. This is now documented in README.
\* Added rule for Pure-FTPd, from a posting in the BlockHosts forum.
1.0.3, November 06, 2005:
\* SSHD-Invalid rule now accepts "Invalid" or "Illegal" words.
"Illegal" was added based on a report regarding Debian linux installs.
1.0.2, October 29, 2005:
\* Added back check for "Failed password.." line in addition to "Invalid
user".
This is needed when PasswordAuthentication is yes, and PermitRootLogin
is no. In this case, sshd only prints a "Failed password" line, does
not print "Invalid user" line.
For non-root users, both lines are printed. To prevent double counting
of the IP address for the same connection, blockhosts.py now looks at
process-id also, and will only count one failure per process id.
1.0.1, October 26, 2005:
\* .cfg file changed to include "Invalid user" matches, and disabled the
"Failed Password " match. Looks like sshd always puts a "Invalid user"
line irrespective of passwords yes/no.
It puts "Failed password" line if PasswordAuthentication is "no"
in sshd\_config, in which case, it also puts out the "Invalid user"
line. So, to cover the most cases, I've now disabled the
"Failed password" line by default, and enabled the "Invalid user" line
instead.
Same change applied to built-in rules in blockhosts.py
Thanks to Paul Eden  for an email mentioning log
behavior when PasswordAuthentication is "no", that led me to this
simplifying of the blockhosts rules.
1.0.0, June 11, 2005:
\* First official release.
\* Support for --discard=0, which will expire all counts/hosts, and start
counting afresh from that point in time. Useful for the first run
of this program, to start with a clean slate. Without this, it will
take one cycle (default 12 hours) to get all really old IP addresses
cleaned out.
\* Added --echo "tag" option, see example shown in the INSTALL file, for
use in the hosts.allow file to pass client and server info to
blockhosts.py. This echo tag can be used to identify particular
execution of blockhosts.py - which client kicked it off, and name of
the server daemon invoked.
\* Updated INSTALL with rpm install instructions.
0.9.0, May 30, 2005:
\* Removed import of mx.Tools.NewBuiltins, use eval() for all .cfg file
input, since eval() has to be used for atleast one of the lines anyway
\* Switched to using "ProFTPD" instead of "VsFTPD" as the default.
Removed /var/log/vsftpd.log from default logfiles.
Now only reads from /var/log/secure
This is enough for sshd & proftpd
[I could not get vstpd to work on Fedora FC3, ProFTPD worked, so
switched to ProFTPD.]
\* Minor updates to --help output; added more info in INSTALL file
\* Added syslog() updates - only errors and final non-error message with
updated counts is sent to syslog
\* Updated makefile to produce a "man page"
0.5.0, May 17, 2005:
\* Important: by default, this program now uses /etc/hosts.allow as the
hosts-block-file.
hosts.deny is being deprecated on some platforms, additionally,
this will make things simple since a single file - hosts.allow can be
used to both allow or deny a host.
\* Important: argument name changed:
new name: --blockfile
is to be used instead of the old --denyfile
The default value for this is "/etc/hosts.allow", so to get old
behavior, use --blockfile=/etc/hosts.deny
\* To support above, the blockhosts.cfg option HOSTS\_DENYFILE changed to
HOSTS\_BLOCKFILE
\* Added more documentation, INSTALL file has instructions and example
0.5.1, - bug fix:
\*
0.4.0, May 15, 2005:
\* Bug fixed, line 802, offset may be left uninitialized, so reading in
new logfiles would fail
0.3.0, May 15, 2005:
\* Many changes, some options also may have changed from 0.1.0
\* Uses a config file at /etc/blockhosts.cfg
\* added many more options, and --help
\* Coding flow modified, catching appropriate exceptions, more careful in
\* updating hosts.deny
0.1.0, May 8, 2005: initial release
