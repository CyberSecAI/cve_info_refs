{
  "CVE-2007-2443": {
    "root_cause": "Integer conversion error in the `gssrpc__svcauth_unix()` function of the krb5 RPC library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The function stores an unsigned integer into a signed integer variable. This leads to an integer overflow when a large unsigned value is converted to a negative signed integer.",
       "The function uses the signed integer to check if the length of the string is less than `MAX_MACHINE_NAME`.  A negative value will pass the check because it's always less than the max. This bypasses the intended length restriction.",
      "After the length check, the function calls `memmove()` with the attacker controlled, negative, converted to a very large unsigned value, as the size argument. This causes a stack buffer overflow."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a stack buffer overflow leading to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution with root privileges on the affected system.",
    "attack_vectors": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted request to the kadmind service.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable service. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.",
     "additional_details": "The memmove() implementation receives a very large number, which will almost certainly cause some sort of memory access fault prior to returning. This probably avoids any usage of the corrupted return address in the overwritten stack frame. Note that some (perhaps unlikely) memmove() implementations may call other procedures and thus may be vulnerable to corrupted return addresses. This means exploitation might be difficult and dependent on the memmove implementation used."
