How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## MIT Kerberos kadmind RPC library gssrpc\_\_svcauth\_unix() integer conversion error

#### Vulnerability Note VU#365313

Original Release Date: 2007-06-26 | Last Revised: 2007-08-08

---

### Overview

The MIT Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) contains an integer conversion error vulnerability, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

### Description

| The gssrpc\_\_svcauth\_unix() function used by the Kerberos administration daemon contains an integer conversion error. This vulnerability may cause a stack buffer overflow that could allow a remote, authenticated user to execute arbitrary code. According to MIT krb5 Security Advisory [MITKRB5-SA-2007-004](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2007-004.txt):  *The function gssrpc\_\_svcauth\_unix() in src/lib/rpc/svc\_auth\_unix.c stores an unsigned integer obtained from IXDR\_GET\_U\_LONG into a signed integer variable "str\_len". Subsequently, it checks that "str\_len" is less than MAX\_MACHINE\_NAME, which will always be true of "str\_len" is negative, which can happen when a large unsigned integer is converted to a signed integer. Once the length check succeeds, gssrpc\_\_svcauth\_unix() calls memmove() with a length of "str\_len" with the target in a stack buffer.* *This vulnerability is believed to be difficult to exploit because the memmove() implementation receives a very large number (a negative integer converted to a large unsigned value), which will almost certainly cause some sort of memory access fault prior to returning. This probably avoids any usage of the corrupted return address in the overwritten stack frame. Note that some (perhaps unlikely) memmove() implementations may call other procedures and thus may be vulnerable to corrupted return addresses.*Note that this issue affects all releases of MIT krb5 up to and including krb5-1.6.1. Third-party applications using the MIT krb5 RPC library or other RPC libraries derived from SunRPC may also be vulnerable. MIT has been provided with proof-of-concept exploit code that causes a denial of service, but it's not clear whether the exploit code is publicly available yet.This vulnerability occurred as a result of failing to comply with rule [INT31-C](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/INT31-C.%2BEnsure%2Bthat%2Binteger%2Bconversions%2Bdo%2Bnot%2Bresult%2Bin%2Blost%2Bor%2Bmisinterpreted%2Bdata) of the CERT C Programming Language Secure Coding Standard. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated user may be able to execute arbitrary code on an affected system or cause the affected program to crash, resulting in a denial of service. Secondary impacts of code execution include complete compromise of the Kerberos key database. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**A patch can be obtained from MIT krb5 Security Advisory [MITKRB5-SA-2007-004](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2007-004.txt). MIT also states that this will be addressed in the upcoming krb5-1.6.2 and krb5-1.5.4 releases. Please check with your vendor for third-party product updates. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2007-004
Original release: 2007-06-26
Last update: 2007-06-26
Topic: kadmind affected by multiple RPC library vulnerabilities
Severity: CRITICAL
CVE: CVE-2007-2442
CERT: VU#356961
CVE: CVE-2007-2443
CERT: VU#365313
SUMMARY
=======
The MIT krb5 Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) is affected by
multiple vulnerabilities in the RPC library shipped with MIT krb5.
CVE-2007-2442/VU#356961: The RPC library can free an uninitialized
pointer. This may lead to execution of arbitrary code.
CVE-2007-2443/VU#365313: The RPC library can write past the end of a
stack buffer. This may (but is unlikely to) lead to execution of
arbitrary code.
Third-party applications using the RPC library provided with MIT krb5
may also be vulnerable. Other RPC libraries derived from SunRPC may
be vulnerable to CVE-2007-2443.
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities is believed to be difficult.
(See DETAILS.) Proof-of-concept exploits which do not cause execution
of unintended code exist but are not known to be publicly circulated.
This is a bug in the RPC library included with MIT krb5, which is used
by kadmind and by some third-party applications. It is not a bug in
the Kerberos protocol.
IMPACT
======
An unauthenticated remote user may be able to cause a host running
kadmind to execute arbitrary code. CVE-2007-2442 is more likely to
lead to arbitrary code execution than CVE-2007-2443.
Successful exploitation can compromise the Kerberos key database and
host security on the host running these programs. (kadmind typically
runs as root.) Unsuccessful exploitation attempts will likely result
in the affected program crashing.
Third-party applications calling the RPC library provided with MIT
krb5 may be vulnerable. Other RPC libraries derived from SunRPC may
be vulnerable.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* kadmind from MIT releases up to and including krb5-1.6.1
\* third-party applications calling the RPC library included in MIT
releases up to and including krb5-1.6.1
FIXES
=====
\* The upcoming krb5-1.6.2 release, as well as the upcoming krb5-1.5.4
maintenance release, will contain fixes for this vulnerability.
Prior to that release you may:
\* apply the patch

DETAILS
=======
CVE-2007-2442: The function gssrpc\_\_svcauth\_gssapi() in
src/lib/rpc/svc\_auth\_gssapi.c declares an automatic variable "creds"
of type auth\_gssapi\_creds. This type includes a gss\_buffer\_desc
(which includes a pointer to void used as a pointer to a buffer of
bytes). If gssrpc\_\_svcauth\_gssapi() receives an RPC credential with a
length of zero, it jumps to the label "error", which executes some
cleanup code. At this point, the gss\_buffer\_desc in "creds" is not
yet initialized, and the cleanup code calls xdr\_free() on "creds",
which then attempts to free the memory pointed to by the uninitialized
"value" member of the gss\_buffer\_desc.
Exploitation of freeing of invalid pointers is believed to be
difficult, and depends on a variety of factors specific to a given
malloc implementation.
CVE-2007-2443: The function gssrpc\_\_svcauth\_unix() in
src/lib/rpc/svc\_auth\_unix.c stores an unsigned integer obtained from
IXDR\_GET\_U\_LONG into a signed integer variable "str\_len".
Subsequently, it checks that "str\_len" is less than MAX\_MACHINE\_NAME,
which will always be true of "str\_len" is negative, which can happen
when a large unsigned integer is converted to a signed integer. Once
the length check succeeds, gssrpc\_\_svcauth\_unix() calls memmove() with
a length of "str\_len" with the target in a stack buffer.
This vulnerability is believed to be difficult to exploit because the
memmove() implementation receives a very large number (a negative
integer converted to a large unsigned value), which will almost
certainly cause some sort of memory access fault prior to returning.
This probably avoids any usage of the corrupted return address in the
overwritten stack frame. Note that some (perhaps unlikely) memmove()
implementations may call other procedures and thus may be vulnerable
to corrupted return addresses.

MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2007-004
Original release: 2007-06-26
Last update: 2007-06-26
Topic: kadmind affected by multiple RPC library vulnerabilities
Severity: CRITICAL
CVE: CVE-2007-2442
CERT: VU#356961
CVE: CVE-2007-2443
CERT: VU#365313
SUMMARY
=======
The MIT krb5 Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) is affected by
multiple vulnerabilities in the RPC library shipped with MIT krb5.
CVE-2007-2442/VU#356961: The RPC library can free an uninitialized
pointer. This may lead to execution of arbitrary code.
CVE-2007-2443/VU#365313: The RPC library can write past the end of a
stack buffer. This may (but is unlikely to) lead to execution of
arbitrary code.
Third-party applications using the RPC library provided with MIT krb5
may also be vulnerable. Other RPC libraries derived from SunRPC may
be vulnerable to CVE-2007-2443.
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities is believed to be difficult.
(See DETAILS.) Proof-of-concept exploits which do not cause execution
of unintended code exist but are not known to be publicly circulated.
This is a bug in the RPC library included with MIT krb5, which is used
by kadmind and by some third-party applications. It is not a bug in
the Kerberos protocol.
IMPACT
======
An unauthenticated remote user may be able to cause a host running
kadmind to execute arbitrary code. CVE-2007-2442 is more likely to
lead to arbitrary code execution than CVE-2007-2443.
Successful exploitation can compromise the Kerberos key database and
host security on the host running these programs. (kadmind typically
runs as root.) Unsuccessful exploitation attempts will likely result
in the affected program crashing.
Third-party applications calling the RPC library provided with MIT
krb5 may be vulnerable. Other RPC libraries derived from SunRPC may
be vulnerable.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* kadmind from MIT releases up to and including krb5-1.6.1
\* third-party applications calling the RPC library included in MIT
releases up to and including krb5-1.6.1
FIXES
=====
\* The upcoming krb5-1.6.2 release, as well as the upcoming krb5-1.5.4
maintenance release, will contain fixes for this vulnerability.
Prior to that release you may:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MIT Kerberos 5: Arbitrary remote code execution — GLSA **200707-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities in MIT Kerberos 5 could potentially result in
remote code execution with root privileges by unauthenticated users.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/mit-krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.2-r3** |

### Background

MIT Kerberos 5 is a suite of applications that implement the Kerberos
network protocol.

### Description

kadmind is affected by multiple vulnerabilities in the RPC library
shipped with MIT Kerberos 5. It fails to properly handle zero-length
RPC credentials (CVE-2007-2442) and the RPC library can write past the
end of the stack buffer (CVE-2007-2443). Furthermore kadmind fails to
do proper bounds checking (CVE-2007-2798).

### Impact

A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities
to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MIT Kerberos 5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.5.2-r3"
```
### References

* [CVE-2007-2442](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2442)

Package        : krb5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-2442 CVE-2007-2443 CVE-2007-2798

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MIT reference
implementation of the Kerberos network authentication protocol suite,
which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-2442

    Wei Wang discovered that the free of an uninitialised pointer in the
    Kerberos RPC library may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-2443

    Wei Wang discovered that insufficient input sanitising in the
    Kerberos RPC library may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-2798

    It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the  Kerberos
    administration daemon may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the old stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-2sarge5. Packages for hppa, mips and powerpc are not yet
available. They will be provided later.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-7etch2. Packages for hppa and mips are not yet available.
They will be provided later.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.dfsg.1-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your Kerberos packages.

Upgrade Instructions

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
