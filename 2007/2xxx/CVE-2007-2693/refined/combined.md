Description:
If user 'molly' has ALTER privilege on table1, she can discover what is
in table1 even though she has no SELECT privileges. For example she says:
ALTER TABLE table1 PARTITION BY LIST (column1) (PARTITION x VALUES IN (0));
MySQL helpfully returns an error message:
"Table has no partition for value 18".
So now Molly knows there is a row where column1 = 18.

It is arguable that this is not a partition-specific bug, since
users with ALTER privileges have always been able to discover
some information about the value range. I argue that this is
more serious because it's easier to get exact values.

How to repeat:
As user root, say:

mysql> create table tu (s1 int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> insert into tu values (1);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> grant alter on tu to molly@localhost;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

As user molly@localhost, say:

mysql> select * from tu;
ERROR 1142 (42000): SELECT command denied to user 'molly'@'localhost' for table 'tu'
mysql> alter table tu partition by list (s1) (partition p1 values in (1));
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.05 sec)
Records: 1  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql> alter table tu partition by list (s1) (partition p1 values in (2));
ERROR 1513 (HY000): Table has no partition for value 1
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
