Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2883:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   CREDANT Mobile Guardian (CMG) Shield failed to properly clear user credentials from system memory after authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Memory Clearing:** The software did not zero out the memory locations holding the original passwords after creating a hash, leaving the plaintext credentials vulnerable.
*  **Default Pagefile Setting:** The default configuration of CMG Shield did not encrypt the Windows pagefile, increasing the risk as credentials in memory could be written to disk unencrypted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker with access to system memory (or the pagefile) could retrieve user credentials, including the Windows domain password.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Stolen credentials could be used to access encrypted files and the Windows domain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Memory Access:** An attacker could gain access to system memory (e.g., by analyzing a memory dump or by having local access to a computer) to extract the credentials.
*  **Pagefile Access**: If the pagefile is not encrypted, credentials can be obtained by accessing the pagefile's content on the disk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to System Memory:**  The attacker needs the ability to read the contents of system memory or access the pagefile. This could involve local access, malware, or the ability to analyze memory dumps.

**Additional Details:**
*  The issue was identified in a regular internal code review and confirmed by a customer report, and a CERT notification.
* CREDANT released CMG Enterprise Edition 5.2.1 SP1 on May 1, 2007, which included a fix for the vulnerability.
* CREDANT also added core memory management functionality to the product to help ensure automatic clearing of memory.
* Although not directly related to the vulnerability itself, the vendor recommends that the 'Encrypt Windows Paging File' setting should be set to 'True' for all security levels.
