Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-2572:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability present in the `mfa_theme.php` file of the NoAh Content Management System (CMS) version 0.9 pre 1.2.
- The vulnerable code is: `<?php include($tpls[1]); ?>`. This line directly includes a file specified in the `tpls[1]` parameter without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows an attacker to include a remote file by controlling the value of the `tpls[1]` parameter.
- **Lack of input validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the input provided in the `tpls[1]` parameter, leading to the RFI vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can include a malicious file (e.g., a shell script) from a remote server and execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server.
- **Server compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full control of the server, allowing the attacker to steal data, modify content, or perform further malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attacker sends an HTTP GET request to the `mfa_theme.php` file with the `tpls[1]` parameter containing the URL of the malicious file.
- **URL Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `tpls[1]` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network connectivity:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable server via network.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script (`mfa_theme.php`) and the vulnerable parameter (`tpls[1]`).
- **Hosting a malicious file:** The attacker must host the malicious file on a publicly accessible server that can be included by the vulnerable server.

**Additional details:**
- The Exploit-DB entry provides a Dork (search query): This can be used to find vulnerable installations.
- The entry provides a link to download the vulnerable software.
- The exploit example is: `http://site.com/path/noah/modules/noevents/templates/mfa_theme.php?tpls[1]=[[Sh3LL Script]]`
