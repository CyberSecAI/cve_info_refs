## Cumulative Security Update for Outlook Express and Windows Mail (929123)

Published: June 12, 2007 | Updated: July 06, 2007

**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This critical security update resolves two privately reported and two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. One of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted e-mail using Windows Mail in Windows Vista. The other vulnerabilities could allow information disclosure if a user visits a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer and cannot be exploited directly in Outlook Express. For the information disclosure vulnerabilities, users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This is a critical security update for supported editions of Windows Vista. For other versions of Windows, this update is rated important or moderate or low. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

This security update addresses these vulnerabilities by changing the MHTML protocol handler in Windows so that it securely handles MHTML URLs in redirection scenarios and scenarios involving ambiguously typed content. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

## URL Redirect Cross Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2111

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Windows because the MHTML protocol handler incorrectly interprets the MHTML URL redirections that could potentially bypass Internet Explorer domain restrictions. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. If the user viewed the Web page using Internet Explorer, the vulnerability could potentially allow information disclosure. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from another Internet Explorer domain.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2006-2111](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2006-2111).

### Mitigating Factors for URL Redirect Cross Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2111

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability In addition, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content, or compromised Web sites and advertisement servers could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for URL Redirect Cross Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2111

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable theMHTML protocol handler.**

  To disable the protocol handler, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start** and then click **Run.** Enter **regedit.exe** in the text box and click **OK**.
  2. Navigate to **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\CLSID\{05300401-BCBC-11d0-85E3-00C04FD85AB4}**.
  3. Right click **{05300401-BCBC-11d0-85E3-00C04FD85AB4}** and select **Permissions**.
  4. Click **Advanced**.
  5. Uncheck **Allow inheritable permissions from the parent to propagateâ¦**
  6. Click **Remove**, and then click **OK**. Click **Yes** and **OK**on subsequent screens.

  **Impact of workaround:** This workaround disables page rendering for MHTML Web pages.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  To enable the MHTML protocol handler, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start** and then click **Run**. Enter **regedit.exe** in the text box and click **OK**.
  2. Navigate to **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\CLSID\{05300401-BCBC-11d0-85E3-00C04FD85AB4}**.
  3. Right click **{05300401-BCBC-11d0-85E3-00C04FD85AB4}** and select **Permissions**.
  4. Click **Advanced**.
  5. Check **Allow inheritable permissions from the parent to propagate**â¦
  6. Click **OK**, and then click **OK** again.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click Internet, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click Yes to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

#### FAQ for URL Redirect Cross Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2111

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could lead to information disclosure if a user visited a specially crafted Web site or clicked a link in an e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from another Internet Explorer domain.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is present because Windows incorrectly interprets an HTTP server-side redirect that is communicated using the MHTML protocol.

**Why is the MHTML Protocol Vulnerability in an Outlook Express Bulletin?**

While the attack vector is through a Web browser, the actual vulnerability is within a component of Outlook Express.

**What is MHTML?**

MHTML (MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML) is an Internet standard that defines the MIME structure that is used to wrap HTML content. The MHTML protocol handler in Windows is part of Outlook Express and provides a URL type (MHTML://) that permits MHTML encoded documents to be rendered in applications. Therefore, applications such as Internet Explorer will use Outlook Express to process MTHML encoded documents.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from another security zone or domain in Internet Explorer.

**What are Internet Explorer security zones?**

Internet Explorer [security zones](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/174360) are part of a system that divides online content into categories or zones, based on the trustworthiness of the content. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much trust is put in the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone. By default, the policy of the Internet zone prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In no case, however, would an attacker have a way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

These vulnerabilities require that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by changing the MHTML protocol handler in Windows so that it correctly interprets an HTTP server-side redirect that uses the MHTML protocol.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2006-2111.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code that has been published publicly that attempts to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. This security update addresses the vulnerability that potentially could be exploited by using the published proof of concept code. The vulnerability that has been addressed has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2006-2111.

## Windows Mail UNC Navigation Request Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1658

A remote code execution vulnerability results from the way local or UNC navigation requests are handled in Windows Mail. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted e-mail message that could potentially allow execution of code from a local file or UNC path if a user clicked on a link in the e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-1658](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2007-1658).

### Mitigating Factors for Windows Mail UNC Navigation Request Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1658

We have not identified any mitigations for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds for Windows Mail UNC Navigation Request Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-1658

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

**Read e-mail messages in plain text format to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector**

You can help protect yourself against this vulnerability by changing your e-mail settings to read e-mail messages in plain text using Windows Mail in Windows Vista. For information in Windows Mail, search âplain textâ in Help and review âSecurity and privacy in Windows Mail.â

Note. Using this workaround, UNC links are displayed in clear text with the full file path. Reading e-mail in plain text would not prevent a user from clicking a link but it would allow a user to more easily identify specially crafted UNC links before clicking on them.

**Impact of Workaround**: E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

* The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
* Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
* Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  To remove a Web Site from the Trusted Sites Security Zone, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. In the Web sites box, click the name of the Web site you want to remove.
  4. Click the Remove button, and then click **OK** twice.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to remove.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

### FAQ for URL Parsing Cross Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2225

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could result in information disclosure if a user visited a specially crafted Web site or clicked a link in an e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from another Internet Explorer domain.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

URL parsing of ambiguously typed content using the Windows MHTML protocol handler to redirect Internet Explorer causes the MHTML protocol handler to incorrectly interpret HTTP headers for MHTML content.

**Why is the MHTML Protocol Vulnerability in an Outlook Express Bulletin?**

While the attack vector is through a Web browser, the actual vulnerability is within a component of Outlook Express.

**What is MHTML?**

MHTML (MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML) is an Internet standard that defines the MIME structure that is used to wrap HTML content. The MHTML protocol handler in Windows is part of Outlook Express and provides a URL type (MHTML://) that permits MHTML encoded documents to be rendered in applications. Therefore, applications such as Internet Explorer will use Outlook Express to processes MTHML encoded documents.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from another security zone or domain in Internet Explorer.

**What are Internet Explorer security zones?**

Internet Explorer [security zones](https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q174360) are part of a system that divides online content into categories or zones, based on the trustworthiness of the content. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much trust is put in the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone. By default, the policy of the Internet zone prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In no case, however, would an attacker have a way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by correctly parsing ambiguously typed content using the Windows MHTML protocol handler.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Content Disposition Parsing Cross Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2227

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way MHTML protocol handler passes Content-Disposition notifications back to Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass the file download dialog box in Internet Explorer. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. If the user viewed the Web page using Internet Explorer, the vulnerability could potentially allow information disclosure. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from another Internet Explorer domain.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-2227](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2007-2227).

### Mitigating Factors for Content Disposition Parsing Cross Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2227

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability In addition, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content, or compromised Web sites and advertisement servers could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

### Workarounds for Content Disposition Parsing Cross Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2227

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable theMHTML protocol handler.**

  To disable the protocol handler, follow these steps:

  4. Click **Advanced.**
  5. Uncheck **Allow inheritable permissions from the parent to propagateâ¦**
  6. Click **Remove**, and then click **OK**. Click **Yes** and **OK**on subsequent screens.

  **Impact of workaround:** This workaround disables page rendering for MHTML Web pages.

  **How to undo the workaround:**

  To enable the MHTML protocol handler, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start** and then click **Run**. Enter **regedit.exe** in the text box and click **OK**.
  2. .Navigate to **HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\CLSID\{05300401-BCBC-11d0-85E3-00C04FD85AB4}.**
  3. .Right click **{05300401-BCBC-11d0-85E3-00C04FD85AB4}** and select **Permissions**.
  4. Click **Advanced**.
  5. Check **Allow inheritable permissions from the parent to propagate**â¦
  6. Click **OK**, and then click **OK** again.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. .Click the **Security** tab.
  3. .Click Internet, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. .Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.

  6. .Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. .Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are "\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com" and â\*.update.microsoft.comâ (without the quotation marks).

For more information on the support lifecycle policy, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/).

When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Package installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Package installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the system will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the system after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the system will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the system shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Package installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Package installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the system will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the system after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the system will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the system shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Package installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

### Windows Vista (all versions)

**Reference Table**

The following table contains the security update information for this software. You can find additional information in the subsection, **Deployment Information**, in this section.

| **Inclusion in Future Service Packs** | The update for this issue will be included in a future service pack or update rollup |

| Further information | See the subsection, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance** |
| **Restart Requirement** |  |
| Restart required | This update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason, or if required files are being used, this update will require a restart. If this behavior occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart. |
| Hotpatching | This security update does not support HotPatching. For more information about HotPatching see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 897341](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/897341). |
| **Removal Information** | To remove this update, click Control Panel, click Security, then under Windows Update, click View installed updates and select from the list of updates. |
| **File Information** | See the subsection, **File Information**, in this section for the full file manifest |

### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, Windows checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Windows hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer will apply the LDR version of this update. Otherwise, the installer will apply the GDR version of the update.

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with /quiet, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |

**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  **Note** Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in **Start Search**.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click on the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. Under the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided earlier in this section.
  4. You may also click on the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided earlier in this section.
  5. Finally, you may also click on the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
