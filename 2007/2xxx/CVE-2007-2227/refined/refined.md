      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-2227",
      "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way MHTML protocol handler passes Content-Disposition notifications back to Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass the file download dialog box in Internet Explorer. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. If the user viewed the Web page using Internet Explorer, the vulnerability could potentially allow information disclosure. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from another Internet Explorer domain.",
      "root_cause": "The MHTML protocol handler incorrectly interprets Content-Disposition notifications handed back to Internet Explorer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of Content-Disposition notifications by the MHTML protocol handler leading to cross-domain information disclosure.",
        "Bypassing of Internet Explorer's file download dialog box."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially read data from another Internet Explorer domain, due to the ability to bypass the file download dialog.",
      "attack_vector": "The attacker needs to host a specially crafted web page, and convince the victim to visit the malicious website.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious web page. The attacker needs to entice the victim to visit this page."

      "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Windows because the MHTML protocol handler incorrectly interprets the MHTML URL redirections that could potentially bypass Internet Explorer domain restrictions. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. If the user viewed the Web page using Internet Explorer, the vulnerability could potentially allow information disclosure. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from another Internet Explorer domain.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is present because Windows incorrectly interprets an HTTP server-side redirect that is communicated using the MHTML protocol.",

        "Incorrect interpretation of MHTML URL redirections by the MHTML protocol handler.",
        "Bypass of Internet Explorer domain restrictions."

        "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability results from the way local or UNC navigation requests are handled in Windows Mail. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted e-mail message that could potentially allow execution of code from a local file or UNC path if a user clicked on a link in the e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.",

An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. If the user viewed the Web page using Internet Explorer, the vulnerability could potentially allow information disclosure. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from another Internet Explorer domain.",
