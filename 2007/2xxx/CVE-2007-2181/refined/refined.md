Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2181:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `login.php` file of WEBInsta FM version 0.1.4.
*   The code directly includes a file using a user-controlled parameter `$absolute_path` without proper sanitization.
*   The vulnerable code snippet is: `include($absolute_path."admin/checkpass.php");`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application is vulnerable to RFI because it includes a file based on the `$absolute_path` parameter provided via a GET request, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the `$absolute_path` parameter, leading to the inclusion of arbitrary files.
*   **Reliance on Register Globals:** The exploit depends on the `register_globals` setting being enabled in PHP, which is a deprecated and insecure practice.
*   **Magic Quotes:** The exploit requires `magic_quotes_gpc` to be turned off.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file containing PHP code, potentially taking full control of the affected server.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `admin/login.php`.
*   The attacker sets the `absolute_path` parameter in the URL to point to a malicious file hosted on a remote server.
*   The attacker also needs to provide cookies (`adminname`, `adminpass`, `PHPSESSID`)
*   The script requires `register_globals` to be ON and `magic_quotes` to be OFF.
*   The attacker can execute OS commands using a `cmd` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `login.php` file.
*   The attacker needs a remote server to host the malicious code.
*   The attacker needs to know that the target server has `register_globals` ON and `magic_quotes` OFF.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided exploit code is written in Perl and automates the process of sending the malicious request and executing commands.
*   The exploit includes a rudimentary shell interface for interacting with the compromised server.
*   The exploit requires the target server to have register globals enabled and magic quotes disabled which are outdated and insecure settings.
