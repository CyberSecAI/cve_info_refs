Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2007-2753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `devami.asp` script of the RunawaySoft Haber portal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The `id` parameter in the `devami.asp` script is vulnerable to SQL injection. This allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query.
* **Database Disclosure:** The application also suffers from a database disclosure issue, where the `xice.mdb` database file is accessible via the web.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Data Breach:** Successful SQL injection can lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, including user credentials (specifically admin password stored in the `admin` table) and other potentially confidential information stored within the database.
* **Unauthorized Access:** Exploiting the SQL injection could grant an attacker administrative access to the application.
* **Database Access:** The direct access to the database file enables an attacker to download or potentially modify the database contents.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed through a crafted HTTP GET request to `devami.asp` with a malicious SQL query injected into the `id` parameter.
* **Direct URL Access:** Direct access to the database file by knowing or guessing its location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
* **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand basic SQL syntax and how to craft injection attacks.
* **Knowledge of the Application's URL Structure:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script (`devami.asp`) and potentially the database path.

**Additional Information:**
* The exploit example uses `union select` to bypass authentication and extract the admin password.
* The content suggests there might be multiple vulnerabilities, mentioning CVE-2007-2752 alongside this CVE.
* The application uses an ASP-based platform and an Access database (MDB).
* The affected application is the RunawaySoft Haber portal version 1.0.
