Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2538 (although the primary focus of the provided exploits is for CVE-2007-2539, they are related and the exploit targets functionality used in both.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `debug_show.php` file of RunCms versions 1.5.2 and earlier. This file allows unauthenticated users to execute functions intended for debugging purposes: `show_files()` and `show_queries()`.
*   The `show_queries()` function in `debug.php` deserializes and decodes user-supplied input via `$_POST['executed_queries']` using `unserialize(urldecode($executed_queries))`, without proper sanitization. This deserialized input is then used in a SQL query `EXPLAIN ...`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization of the deserialized data allows for SQL injection. The attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** Deserializing user input without proper validation is a security risk. It makes it easier to inject malicious content into the application flow.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The debug functionality, which should be restricted, is accessible without any authentication.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The exploit demonstrates that it is possible to retrieve the admin password and username from the `users` table. The `show_files` function is also mentioned to be used for information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Access:** An attacker can read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially compromising the entire application.
*   **Credentials Disclosure:** The attacker can gain access to sensitive information, such as admin usernames and passwords. This can lead to complete control of the application.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly demonstrated, the ability to inject SQL queries could potentially lead to further attacks like stored XSS or even arbitrary code execution depending on the database permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `class/debug/debug_show.php` with a `debug_show` parameter set to `show_queries`.
*   **Modified `executed_queries` Parameter:** The `executed_queries` parameter contains serialized and URL-encoded SQL queries injected by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable RunCms server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the path to the `debug_show.php` file and how to construct the malicious `executed_queries` parameter.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code also includes features for specifying a proxy, custom port, and database table prefix.
*   The exploit uses a brute-force approach to extract the admin password and username by iterating through possible characters and checking the SQL injection response.
*   The content mentions both CVE-2007-2539 and CVE-2007-2538, it appears they are related. The SQL injection vulnerability described here is the vulnerability of CVE-2007-2538 and the provided exploit code is designed for this vulnerability.

In summary, RunCms versions 1.5.2 and earlier are vulnerable to SQL injection and information disclosure via `debug_show.php` due to a lack of input sanitization and authentication. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information and compromise the database.
