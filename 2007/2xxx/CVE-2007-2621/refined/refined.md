Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2621

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper input validation in the `event_view.php` file of Thyme Calendar 1.3. Specifically, the `eid` parameter is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code through the `eid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Extraction:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames and password hashes. This is achieved by using `UNION SELECT` statements to append additional queries that retrieve the desired data.
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** By obtaining usernames and passwords, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the application, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `event_view.php` script with a modified `eid` parameter.
- **Direct SQL Injection:** The injected SQL is directly appended to the original query, altering its intended behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and the Thyme Calendar application.
- **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious queries.

**Technical Details:**
- The original SQL query is `SELECT id FROM thyme_Attachments WHERE eid = 34`.
- By manipulating the `eid` parameter (e.g., `eid=34 UNION SELECT userid FROM thyme_Users`), the query becomes `SELECT id FROM thyme_Attachments WHERE eid = 34 UNION SELECT userid FROM thyme_Users`, resulting in the retrieval of user IDs.
- Similarly, an attacker can retrieve password hashes using `eid=34 UNION SELECT pass FROM thyme_Users WHERE username = "admin"`.
- The retrieved data is embedded in the HTML source, making it accessible to the attacker.
