Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-2112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Oracle database logon trigger mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of Logon Trigger:** It is possible to circumvent the execution of Oracle database logon triggers. These triggers are often used to enforce security policies such as restricting user access based on time or IP address or for auditing purposes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Security Policy Violation:** Attackers can bypass restrictions on user access that are enforced by logon triggers. This can lead to unauthorized database access.
*   **Audit Evasion:**  Logon triggers often record login attempts into custom audit tables. Exploitation can prevent these audit entries from being logged, thus obscuring the attacker's activity.
*   **Unrestricted Access:** Once the logon trigger is bypassed, users can connect to the database and execute SQL statements without the intended limitations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves exploiting a weakness in how Oracle handles logon triggers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to initiate a database connection. No specific privileges or credentials seem to be explicitly required to exploit this vulnerability beyond the need to connect to the database, but an attacker who already has valid credentials could use the bypass to gain further access if logon triggers are in place to restrict them.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Oracle versions 8-10g Release 2.
*   The vendor (Oracle) was informed about the vulnerability on 7th June 2006 and confirmed on 8th June 2006.
*   A patch was released as part of the Oracle Critical Patch Update in April 2007 (CPU April 2007).
*   The vulnerability is identified as "DB05" in Oracle's internal tracking.
