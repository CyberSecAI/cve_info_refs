This allows attackers to install files in any location, potentially overwriting crucial system files if the PEAR Installer is running as a privileged user.",
        "details": "The advisory details that the vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of the 'install-as' attribute in package.xml v1.0 and the tag in package.xml v2.0, which allows malicious packages to install files in arbitrary locations, leading to potential file overwrites. It also includes a proof of concept."
