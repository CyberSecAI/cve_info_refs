Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2487:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in AtomixMP3 due to a `strcpy` function call that doesn't properly handle file paths. Specifically, when AtomixMP3 loads MP3 files, it copies the file paths using `strcpy`. If the file path is longer than the allocated buffer, it causes a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The primary vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow triggered by overly long file paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: Exploitation of this buffer overflow can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine.
- Partial Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:  The CVSS score indicates partial impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted MP3 file: An attacker needs to create or modify an MP3 file with a file path that's longer than the buffer. When AtomixMP3 attempts to load the file, the overflow occurs.
- User interaction: The user needs to open/load the malicious MP3 file in AtomixMP3 for the exploit to trigger.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious MP3 file to a user running vulnerable AtomixMP3.
- The attacker doesn't require prior authentication.
- Low complexity to perform the attack.
- The attacker can achieve remote code execution by enticing a user to open a specially crafted file.

**Additional details:**
- The provided cxsecurity.com content includes a link to an exploit (`Atomixb0f.zip`) that could be used to trigger the vulnerability.
- The CVSS base score is 7.5/10 with a high exploitability subscore (10/10).
- The attack is local but can be achieved remotely by sending a specially crafted file to a user of the vulnerable software.
