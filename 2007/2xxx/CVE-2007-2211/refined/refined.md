Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2211

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection in the `calendar.php` script of MyBulletinBoard (MyBB) versions 1.2.5 and earlier.
- It arises from unsanitized user-supplied input within the `day` parameter of the `calendar.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not directly output the result of the SQL query. Instead, the attacker infers the output based on the application's response (e.g., the presence of a "profile" string in the response).
- Unsanitized Input: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `day` parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user passwords, by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability. The exploit provided targets extracting the MD5 hash of user passwords.
- Full Database Compromise: In a broader sense, it's possible for a skilled attacker to potentially gain full control over the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `calendar.php`.
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific URL with malicious SQL code injected into the `day` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote access to the vulnerable MyBB installation.
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.
- No authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit script injects a SQL substring function to compare each character of a password hash to characters 48-57 and then 97-122. The script does this repeatedly to extract the full 32 character MD5 hash.
- The `istrue2` function checks for a "profile" string in the server response which is used to confirm correct character guesses.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit script provided is written in Perl.
- The exploit specifically targets the `mybb_users` table and extracts user password hashes.
- The vulnerability is demonstrated by the presence of the exploit script.
