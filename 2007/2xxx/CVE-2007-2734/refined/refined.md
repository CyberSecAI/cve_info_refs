Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2734

**Vulnerability Description:**

The vulnerability lies in the failure of various HTTP content scanning systems to properly scan HTTP traffic encoded using full-width/half-width Unicode characters. This allows attackers to bypass these scanning systems by sending specially crafted HTTP requests.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the inadequate handling of full-width/half-width Unicode encoding by HTTP content scanning systems. These systems do not correctly normalize or interpret such encodings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Unicode Handling:** The vulnerability stems from the failure of content scanning systems to correctly decode and interpret full-width/half-width Unicode characters in HTTP traffic.
*   **Evasion of Content Filtering:** The primary weakness is the ability to evade the intended security mechanisms of HTTP content scanners, allowing malicious payloads to pass undetected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of HTTP Content Scanners:** Attackers can bypass content filtering and intrusion detection systems.
*   **Delivery of Malicious Payloads:** Successful exploitation allows malicious HTTP traffic to reach its intended target, potentially leading to further compromise such as arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or defacement.
*   **Compromised Security Posture:** The overall security of networks and systems protected by vulnerable scanning systems is significantly reduced.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attacks:** Exploitation occurs through network traffic, specifically within HTTP requests.
*   **Specially Crafted HTTP Requests:** Attackers send crafted HTTP requests containing malicious payloads encoded with full-width/half-width Unicode characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP traffic to the vulnerable system, which could be from a local network or remotely over the internet.
*   **Knowledge of Unicode Encoding:** Attackers need to be aware of and able to use full-width/half-width Unicode encoding to craft the malicious requests.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Exploitation can occur without authentication, making it easier for attackers to launch attacks.

**Affected Systems:**

The CERT vulnerability note lists multiple vendors and their products affected by this issue, including:

*   3com, Inc.
*   Cisco Systems, Inc.
*   Internet Security Systems, Inc. (IBM)
*   McAfee
*   Novell, Inc.
*   Secure Computing Network Security Division
*   Stonesoft
*   TippingPoint, Technologies, Inc.

Several vendors were also listed as not affected.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Software Updates:** Vendors released patches or updates to address this issue.
*   **Proper Unicode Handling:** Content scanning systems should be updated to properly normalize and handle full-width/half-width Unicode encoding in HTTP traffic.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Fatih Ozavci and Caglar Cakici of Gamasec Security.
*   The vulnerability is tracked by CERT under VU#739224.
*   The provided data includes links to vendor advisories, which give specific fixes for affected products.

This analysis provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and the methods for exploitation.
