Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2820:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper bounds checking in multiple functions of the KSign KSignSWAT ActiveX control. Specifically, the second argument in `SWAT_Init()`, `SWAT_InitEx()`, `SWAT_InitEx2()`, and `SWAT_InitEx3()`, and the single argument in `SWAT_Login()` do not validate the size of the provided buffer before being processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist within the `AxKSignSWAT.dll` (KSignSWAT ActiveX Control) version 2.0.3.3, specifically in the following functions:
  - `SWAT_Init()`
  - `SWAT_InitEx()`
  - `SWAT_InitEx2()`
  - `SWAT_InitEx3()`
  - `SWAT_Login()`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these buffer overflows could allow an attacker to overwrite the EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer) register, leading to arbitrary code execution. This means that an attacker could gain system administrator privileges on the targeted machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted HTML file. When a user opens this file, it can trigger the vulnerable ActiveX control, leading to the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to:
  - Create a malicious HTML file that exploits the buffer overflows.
  - Induce the victim to open the crafted HTML file, which could be achieved via web browsing or a phishing attack.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerabilities were discovered by KIM, KEE HONG (l1nefeed@gmail.com).
- The vendor, KSign ([www.ksign.com](http://www.ksign.com)), was notified, and a patch was reportedly released on May 21, 2007. The issue was disclosed publicly on May 22, 2007.
- The KSignSWAT ActiveX control is a common component used in Korean internet banking, government sites, and stock trading.
- The vulnerable functions do not check the size of the provided buffer, allowing an attacker to overwrite the return address and gain control of program execution.
- Specifically, the overflow occurs if the size of the second argument exceeds 664 bytes in `SWAT_Init()`, `SWAT_InitEx()`, `SWAT_InitEx2()`, `SWAT_InitEx3()`, or the single argument is over 671 bytes in `SWAT_Login()`.
