Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw present in the MyNews version 0.10 software. This vulnerability is exploitable when the PHP setting `magic_quotes_gpc` is set to `Off`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into database queries. This is caused by the use of unsanitized user-controlled input in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Confidentiality Impact: Complete - Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   Integrity Impact: Partial - Attackers can modify database contents.
*   Availability Impact: Partial - Attackers may disrupt the normal functioning of the application.
*   Privilege Escalation: Attackers can gain administrative privileges, allowing them to take full control of the application and potentially the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   HTTP Request: The example provided shows that the attack can be performed through a crafted HTTP request with malicious cookie values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
* The attacker must know that the `magic_quotes_gpc` PHP configuration is turned `Off`.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries.
*   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
* The advisory details that the vendor was unresponsive to security reports and didn't release a patch.
* It describes a specific attack vector, involving setting a malicious `authacc` cookie, which allows an attacker to gain administrative access by modifying the password via `admin.php`.
* The provided `CVSS` score is `6.8`, with a confidentiality bias.
* The advisory also provides a workaround of setting `magic_quotes_gpc = On` in the `php.ini` file.
