  "CVE-2007-2141": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of user input in `shoutbox.php` when writing to the `shouts.php` file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
        "Remote code injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary PHP code execution on the server. The attacker can execute commands on the system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to `shoutbox.php` with malicious PHP code in the 'shout' parameter."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.",
      "additional_details": "The provided exploit code performs a two-step attack:\n\n1.  It injects a temporary payload that is PHP code into the `shouts.php` file. This payload is designed to take base64 encoded data from a POST parameter and write it to a file.\n2. It uses the temporary payload to write a second payload (also PHP) that allows command execution via a 'cmd' GET parameter to a file named module.php.\n3.  It attempts to clean the `shouts.php` of the injected code"
