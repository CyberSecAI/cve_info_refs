Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow within the Computer Associates Anti-Virus engine. This occurs when processing CAB archive files, specifically due to a failure to validate the size of the `coffFiles` field before copying it into a stack buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the stack-based buffer overflow. The engine copies data without proper bounds checking, potentially overwriting stack memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system, giving them control of the machine.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation could also lead to a denial-of-service condition, causing the software or system to become unstable or unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a remote attacker without requiring any authentication.
- **Malformed CAB Archives:** The attack vector involves delivering a specially crafted CAB archive containing a malformed `coffFiles` field to the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send malicious CAB archive files to a system running the vulnerable Computer Associates Anti-Virus engine. This could be through various channels like email, web browsing, or other file transfer methods.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the CAB archive processing code.
- The `coffFiles` field size is not validated prior to a copy operation to a stack buffer
- The vulnerability affects multiple Computer Associates products using the vulnerable engine, including but not limited to: CA Anti-Virus, eTrust EZ Antivirus, CA Internet Security Suite 2007, eTrust Internet Security Suite, eTrust EZ Armor, CA Threat Manager, CA Protection Suites, CA Secure Content Manager, CA Anti-Virus Gateway, Unicenter Network and Systems Management, BrightStor ARCserve Backup, CA Common Services, CA Anti-Virus SDK.
- A security update (content update 30.6) was issued by Computer Associates to address this issue.
