```
Last May, there was an advisory published by Chris Evans about image
parsing library vulnerabilities in Sun's JDK:

   <http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2006-004.html>

This seems to have resulted in Bugtraq 24267 / CVE-2007-3004 duplicating
Bugtraq 24004 / CVE-2007-2788 and CVE-2007-2789. Steve, any ideas?

No, the clean-up got lost in the shuffle.

Sun Alert 102934 now uses the older CVE's; CVE-2007-3004 and CVE-2007-3005
are being REJECTED.

Note that a lot of references are affected.

Sorry about the non-answer back in July :-(

# IBM JDK/JRE: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200806-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in IBM Java Development Kit (JDK)
and Java Runtime Environment (JRE), resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.7**revision >= **1.4.2.11** |

| Package | **dev-java/ibm-jre-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.7**revision >= **1.4.2.11** |

### Background

The IBM Java Development Kit (JDK) and the IBM Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the IBM Java platform.

### Description

Because of sharing the same codebase, IBM JDK and JRE are affected by
the vulnerabilities mentioned in GLSA 200804-20.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All IBM JDK 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin-1.5.0.7"
```

All IBM JDK 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jdk-bin-1.4.2.11"
```

All IBM JRE 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jre-bin-1.5.0.7"
```

All IBM JRE 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/ibm-jre-bin-1.4.2.11"
```

# BEA JRockit: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200709-15**

BEA JRockit contains several vulnerabilities, some of which may allow the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.11\_p1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.11\_p1** |

### Background

BEA JRockit provides tools, utilities, and a complete runtime
environment for developing and running applications using the Java
programming language.

### Description

An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the embedded ICC profile
image parser (CVE-2007-2788), an unspecified vulnerability exists in
the font parsing implementation (CVE-2007-4381), and an error exists
when processing XSLT stylesheets contained in XSLT Transforms in XML
signatures (CVE-2007-3716), among other vulnerabilities.

### Impact

A remote attacker could trigger the integer overflow to execute
arbitrary code or crash the JVM through a specially crafted file. Also,
an attacker could perform unauthorized actions via an applet that
grants certain privileges to itself because of the font parsing
vulnerability. The error when processing XSLT stylesheets can be
exploited to execute arbitrary code. Other vulnerabilities could lead
to establishing restricted network connections to certain services,
Cross Site Scripting and Denial of Service attacks.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all these
vulnerabilities.

### Resolution

All BEA JRockit users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin-1.5.0.11_p1"
```

# JRockit: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200804-28**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in BEA JRockit.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.14** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.4.2.16**>= **1.5.0.14** |

### Background

JRockit is BEA WebLogic's J2SE Development Kit.

### Description

Because of sharing the same codebase, JRockit is affected by the
vulnerabilities mentioned in GLSA 200804-20.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All JRockit 1.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin-1.4.2.16"
```

All JRockit 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin-1.5.0.14"
```

The vulnerability is caused due to an unspecified error within the use of system classes. This can e.g. be exploited to read and write to local files via malicious Java Web Start Applications.    The vulnerability is reported in Java Web Start in JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 10 and Java Web Start in SDK and JRE 1.4.2_13 and earlier for Windows, Solaris and Linux. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Vlastimil Babka (Caster) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-01 13:56:41 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 175280](show_bug.cgi?id=175280 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Please mark dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.5.0.11 stable") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Petteri Räty (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-01 14:01:45 UTC  ``` amd64: please do sun-jre-bin-1.5.0.11 as you didn't get to doing it in [bug 175280](show_bug.cgi?id=175280 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Please mark dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.5.0.11 stable"). ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Vlastimil Babka (Caster) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-01 14:03:06 UTC  ``` amd64, please stabilize: dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.5.0.11 app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.5.0.11  I'll bump 1.4 to 1.4.2.14 ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Vlastimil Babka (Caster) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-01 14:36:25 UTC  ``` x86, please stabilize: dev-java/sun-jdk-1.4.2.14 dev-java/sun-jre-bin-1.4.2.14 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-02 10:53:53 UTC  ``` x86 stable, i hate java... ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Vlastimil Babka (Caster) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-02 21:27:45 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=176675#c5)) > x86 stable, i hate java...

### Background

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Sun Java:

* Daniel Soeder discovered that a long codebase attribute string in a
  JNLP file will overflow a stack variable when launched by Java WebStart
  (CVE-2007-3655).
* Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-2435, CVE-2007-2788,
  CVE-2007-2789) that were previously reported as GLSA 200705-23 and GLSA
  200706-08 also affect 1.4 and 1.6 SLOTs, which was not mentioned in the
  initial revision of said GLSAs.
* The Zero Day Initiative, TippingPoint and John Heasman reported
  multiple buffer overflows and unspecified vulnerabilities in Java Web
  Start (CVE-2008-1188, CVE-2008-1189, CVE-2008-1190,
  CVE-2008-1191).
* Hisashi Kojima of Fujitsu and JPCERT/CC reported a security issue
  when performing XSLT transformations (CVE-2008-1187).
* CERT/CC reported a Stack-based buffer overflow in Java Web Start
  when using JNLP files (CVE-2008-1196).
* Azul Systems reported an unspecified vulnerability that allows
  applets to escalate their privileges (CVE-2007-5689).
* Billy Rios, Dan Boneh, Collin Jackson, Adam Barth, Andrew Bortz,
  Weidong Shao, and David Byrne discovered multiple instances where Java
  applets or JavaScript programs run within browsers do not pin DNS
  hostnames to a single IP address, allowing for DNS rebinding attacks
  (CVE-2007-5232, CVE-2007-5273, CVE-2007-5274).
* Peter Csepely reported that Java Web Start does not properly
  enforce access restrictions for untrusted applications (CVE-2007-5237,
  CVE-2007-5238).
* Java Web Start does not properly enforce access restrictions for
  untrusted Java applications and applets, when handling drag-and-drop
  operations (CVE-2007-5239).
* Giorgio Maone discovered that warnings for untrusted code can be
  hidden under applications' windows (CVE-2007-5240).
* Fujitsu reported two security issues where security restrictions of
  web applets and applications were not properly enforced (CVE-2008-1185,
  CVE-2008-1186).
* John Heasman of NGSSoftware discovered that the Java Plug-in does
  not properly enforce the same origin policy (CVE-2008-1192).
* Chris Evans of the Google Security Team discovered multiple
  unspecified vulnerabilities within the Java Runtime Environment Image
  Parsing Library (CVE-2008-1193, CVE-2008-1194).
* Gregory Fleischer reported that web content fetched via the "jar:"
  protocol was not subject to network access restrictions
  (CVE-2008-1195).
* Chris Evans and Johannes Henkel of the Google Security Team
  reported that the XML parsing code retrieves external entities even
  when that feature is disabled (CVE-2008-0628).
* Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities might allow for escalation of
  privileges (CVE-2008-0657).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted applet
on a website or start an application in Java Web Start to execute
arbitrary code outside of the Java sandbox and of the Java security
restrictions with the privileges of the user running Java. The attacker
could also obtain sensitive information, create, modify, rename and
read local files, execute local applications, establish connections in
the local network, bypass the same origin policy, and cause a Denial of
Service via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

US-CERT seems to think Sun: 102934 relates to the CESA-2006-004 article.
The Sun advisory however only credits Chris Evans, but includes no
definitive link to the article. I am inclined to agree that it is
a duplicate.

Last May, there was an advisory published by Chris Evans about image
parsing library vulnerabilities in Sun's JDK:

   <http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2006-004.html>

This seems to have resulted in Bugtraq 24267 / CVE-2007-3004 duplicating
Bugtraq 24004 / CVE-2007-2788 and CVE-2007-2789. Steve, any ideas?

## CESA-2006-004 - rev 2

[See all my vulnerabilities at
<http://scary.beasts.org/security>]
### JDK image parsing library vulnerabilities (ICC parsing, BMP parsing)

---

Programs affected: JDK 1.5.0\_07-b03 and others.

Fixed in: JDK 1.5.0\_11-b03 and JDK 1.6.0\_01-b06.

Reported date: October 2006.

Advisory release date: May 15th 2007.

Severity: Probable remote compromise of systems which use the vulnerable
JDK APIs to parse images.JDK comes with an image parsing API based around the
`javax.imagio.ImageIO` class. A slightly sloppy demo program to
exercise this API would be:
```

import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
import javax.imageio.ImageReader;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import javax.imageio.stream.MemoryCacheImageInputStream;
import javax.imageio.stream.ImageInputStream;

public class ImgReader {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    InputStream is = new FileInputStream(args[0]);
    ImageInputStream iis = new MemoryCacheImageInputStream(is);
    Iterator it = ImageIO.getImageReaders(iis);
    ImageReader reader = it.next();
    reader.setInput(iis);
    int width = reader.getWidth(0);
  }
}

```
This program takes the first command line argument as an image filename to
put through the JDK image parsing API.Of course, most Java image parsing will be safe from the usual gamut of
buffer overflows, integer overflows, subtle memory corruptions, etc. Most, but
not all. The JPEG and BMP parsers support embedded ICC profiles (to do with
colour correction), and the ICC profile parser is actually backed by native
code.
### Flaw 1 - integer overflow(s) in the ICC profile parser

Demo JPG: <http://scary.beasts.org/misc/jdk/badicc.jpg>. It causes a crash of the JVM. The crash is caused by a buffer overflow
subsequent to an integer overflow, so it is likely exploitable to cause
arbitrary code execution on many platforms.Generally, the ICC parser takes quite a few 32-bit integers from ICC profile
data and does not check them for being excessively large.
### Flaw 2 - local file opens in the BMP parser

Demo BMP: <http://scary.beasts.org/misc/jdk/evil2.bmp>. This, on Linux, causes the image parsing thread to hang whilst trying to
read from /dev/tty.Obviously, the broad problem here is that opening local files is not a suitable
thing to do in the context of server-side image parsing.
### Comments

* The native code affected looks to be a library that is likely to be reused
  in other commercial projects. You might want to run the evil JPEG through
  other ICC parsing packages.
* The errant memcpy() triggered can be somewhat wild, but JDK installs a
  SEGV handler which crashes a second time (in a more controllable way), making
  the condition much more interesting.

### Credits

* Google - this flaw was discovered in Google's time. I'm with Google's
  Security Team, and we're always recruiting talented security individuals.

# emul-linux-x86-java: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200706-08**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in emul-linux-x86-java,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of
Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.11**revision >= **1.4.2.16**revision >= **1.4.2.17**revision >= **1.4.2.19** |

### Background

emul-linux-x86-java is the 32 bit version of the Sun's J2SE Development
Kit.

### Description

Chris Evans of the Google Security Team has discovered an integer
overflow in the ICC parser, and another vulnerability in the BMP
parser. An unspecified vulnerability involving an "incorrect use of
system classes" was reported by the Fujitsu security team.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
image, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Emul-linux-x86-java. They also could
entice a user to open a specially crafted BMP image, resulting in a
Denial of Service. Note that these vulnerabilities may also be
triggered by a tool processing image files automatically.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Emul-linux-x86-java users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-java-1.5.0.11"
```

| [Description](#c0)  klavs klavsen    2003-03-20 16:32:46 UTC  ``` It would be of real help, if portage saved the USE settings used when compiling a certain package. This way one could easily see if a package was compiled with f.ex. ldap support. This also goes when using packages from others (the .tbz2 format) - where it would be great to see what USE settings where used.    Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. 2. 3. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sam    2003-03-27 14:54:33 UTC  ``` It already logs it: 'cat /var/db/pkg/cate-gory/app-name-ver.sio-rN/USE'. Should be easy to implement. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Nicholas Jones (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2003-04-28 05:44:55 UTC  ``` Already done. ``` |  |

# Sun JDK/JRE: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200705-23**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in Sun Java Development Kit
(JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-java/sun-jdk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.0.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.0.11**revision >= **1.4.2.14**revision >= **1.4.2.15**revision >= **1.4.2.19** |

| Package | **dev-java/sun-jre-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.6.0.01** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.6.0.01**revision >= **1.5.0.16**revision >= **1.5.0.15**revision >= **1.5.0.12**revision >= **1.5.0.11**revision >= **1.4.2.18**revision >= **1.4.2.17**revision >= **1.4.2.15**revision >= **1.4.2.14**revision >= **1.4.2.19**revision >= **1.5.0.17**revision >= **1.5.0.18** |

### Background

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

### Description

An unspecified vulnerability involving an "incorrect use of system
classes" was reported by the Fujitsu security team. Additionally, Chris
Evans from the Google Security Team reported an integer overflow
resulting in a buffer overflow in the ICC parser used with JPG or BMP
files, and an incorrect open() call to /dev/tty when processing certain
BMP files.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted Java
class or applet that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities. This
could lead to the execution of arbitrary code outside of the Java
sandbox and of the Java security restrictions, or crash the Java
application or the browser.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Sun Java Development Kit users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-java/sun-jdk"
```

All Sun Java Runtime Environment users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-java/sun-jre-bin"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
