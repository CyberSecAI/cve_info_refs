```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to an insecure `require` statement in `ImageImageMagick.php` that includes a file based on user-controlled input in the `glConf[path_system]` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server, leading to complete compromise of the target system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with the `glConf[path_system]` parameter pointing to a remote file, an attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and host a malicious PHP file on a reachable server."
