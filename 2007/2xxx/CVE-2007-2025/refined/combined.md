How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-13 13:05:36 UTC  ``` A vulnerability has been discovered in PhpWiki, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.  The "UpLoad" wiki page (index.php/UpLoad) fails to properly validate the extension of an uploaded file. The blacklist of disallowed file extensions does not include for example ".php3" and ".phtml". This can be exploited to upload files with such extensions and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.  Successful exploitation requires being logged in and that the webserver is configured to execute PHP scripts with such extensions. In the default configuration of PhpWiki, no registration or validation is necessary to log in.  NOTE: The vulnerability is currently being actively exploited.  The vulnerability is confirmed in version 1.3.12p3. Other versions may also be affected.  Solution: Disable the UpLoad functionality by giving the file "lib/plugin/UpLoad.php" the permissions 000 or by moving the file outside of the web tree. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-13 13:06:26 UTC  ``` setting status. web-apps, please advise. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-13 13:21:03 UTC  ``` Hmm no, I was right at first, it's a B1 since ppc had a stable version. sorry for the noise. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Gunnar Wrobel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-10 13:03:17 UTC  ``` There is currently no fixed version available from UPSTREAM. I did proceed as suggested by the advisory and automatically remove the UpLoad.php file during the installation.  Now there is an updated ebuild phpwiki-1.3.10-r3 that contains this fix. It is still marked unstable for ppc. Please test and mark stable on ppc as soon as possible.  I removed two older ebuilds phpwiki-1.3.1{1,2} and added phpwiki-1.3.13_rc1 which will also remove UpLoad.php automatically during install.

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1371-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Thijs Kinkhorst
September 11th, 2007                    <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : phpwiki
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-2024 CVE-2007-2025 CVE-2007-3193
Debian Bug     : 429201 441390

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpWiki, a wiki engine
written in PHP. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-2024

    It was discovered that phpWiki performs insufficient file name
    validation, which allows unrestricted file uploads.

CVE-2007-2025

    It was discovered that phpWiki performs insufficient file name
    validation, which allows unrestricted file uploads.

CVE-2007-3193

    If the configuration lacks a nonzero PASSWORD_LENGTH_MINIMUM,
    phpWiki might allow remote attackers to bypass authentication via
    an empty password, which causes ldap_bind to return true when used
    with certain LDAP implementations.

The old stable distribution (sarge) does not contain phpwiki packages.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.12p3-5etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.12p3-6.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch

      Size/MD5 checksum:  2885540 178a4ca234bf9b66c4b96a3f635dd510

  These files will probably be moved into the stable distribution on
  its next update.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
