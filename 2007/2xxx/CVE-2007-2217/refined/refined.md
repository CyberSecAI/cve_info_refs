Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-2217:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way the Kodak Image Viewer (formerly Wang Image Viewer) handles specially crafted image files, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The primary weakness is that the Kodak Image Viewer improperly parses certain image files, resulting in memory corruption. This corruption allows an attacker to overwrite critical memory locations.
- **Code Execution:** The memory corruption enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution.
- **Full System Control:** A successful exploit can give the attacker complete control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view, change, or delete data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the logged-on user has administrative rights, the attacker gains those same rights, potentially taking complete control of the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker can host a malicious webpage, which when visited by a vulnerable user, can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Email Attacks:** An attacker can embed a specially crafted image file within an email or send it as an attachment. If the user views the email or opens the attachment, the exploit can be triggered.
- **Compromised Websites:** An attacker could inject malicious content to exploit this vulnerability within compromised websites, or legitimate sites that accept user generated content or advertisements.
- **Instant Messaging:** An attacker can send a malicious link through an instant messaging application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can be remote and does not need prior authentication.
- **Crafted Image:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious image file to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires the victim to either visit a website, view an email, or open an email attachment. This is generally achieved through some form of social engineering.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability primarily affects Windows 2000, but systems running supported 32-bit editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 that were upgraded from Windows 2000 are also affected.
- Microsoft has released a patch to address this vulnerability by deprecating unsupported file types and improving the handling of crafted files.
- Publicly available proof-of-concept code exists for this vulnerability, as shown in the exploit-db entry.
- Workarounds include reading emails in plain text and restricting access to oieng400.dll, although these impact functionality.
