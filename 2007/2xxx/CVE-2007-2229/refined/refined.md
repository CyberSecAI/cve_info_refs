Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-2229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from overly permissive Access Control Lists (ACLs) on user information stores within the Windows Vista operating system. These stores, located in the registry and local file system, contained sensitive data, including administrative passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Permissive ACLs:** The primary weakness was the default configuration of ACLs that allowed non-privileged users to access sensitive user information stores.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed unauthorized access to sensitive data like administrative passwords, potentially enabling attackers to escalate privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to disclosure of user account data, including administrative passwords.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could use the disclosed information to gain valid logon credentials, allowing them to potentially take complete control of the affected system or gain access to other user accounts' data.
- **Compromise of System:** With compromised credentials, an attacker could gain full access to the system and all data available to the compromised user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have valid logon credentials on the affected system.
- **Manual Identification:** An attacker would need to logon locally and manually identify the vulnerable information data stores.
 
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a local user account with valid logon credentials on the vulnerable Windows Vista machine.
- **Knowledge of Data Store Locations:** The attacker would need knowledge or means of identifying the specific locations of the vulnerable user information stores in the registry and local file system.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability affects all versions of Windows Vista including x64 edition.
- Systems upgraded from Windows XP might be at higher risk due to potentially storing more information related to the upgrade process.
- The fix involves restricting access to these confidential information data stores to only users with Administrator level privileges.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security update was released.
- There was no evidence of active exploitation reported at the time of the bulletin release.
- No workarounds were identified.
