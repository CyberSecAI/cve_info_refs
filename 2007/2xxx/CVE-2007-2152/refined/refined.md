Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the CERT advisory VU#324929, which is related to CVE-2007-2152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the on-demand virus scanner component of McAfee VirusScan Enterprise. This occurs when the scanner improperly handles files with long filenames containing multi-byte characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow: The software attempts to write more data into a heap buffer than it has allocated, leading to memory corruption.
- Improper input validation: The scanner fails to properly validate the length or contents of filenames, especially those containing multi-byte characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: A successful exploit could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- Denial-of-service (DoS): Exploitation could also result in a denial-of-service condition, crashing the service or system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker without needing prior authentication.
- Maliciously crafted file: The attack involves crafting a file with a long filename containing multi-byte characters that triggers the buffer overflow when scanned.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create malicious files
- Ability to get target system to scan the malicious file

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the target system has East Asia language files installed and the default Unicode codepage is set to a language that contains multi-byte characters (e.g., Chinese).
- McAfee released VirusScan Enterprise 8.0i patch 12 to address the issue.

**CVE Correlation:**
- Although the CERT advisory VU#324929 doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2007-2152, the mentioned advisory describes the same vulnerability as per other sources, making this information relevant.
