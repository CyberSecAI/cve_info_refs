How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# FreeRADIUS: Denial of service — GLSA **200704-14**

A memory leak has been discovered in FreeRADIUS, possibly allowing for a
Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-dialup/freeradius** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.6** |

### Background

FreeRADIUS is an open source RADIUS authentication server
implementation.

### Description

The Coverity Scan project has discovered a memory leak within the
handling of certain malformed Diameter format values inside an EAP-TTLS
tunnel.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a large amount of specially crafted
packets to a FreeRADIUS server using EAP-TTLS authentication and
exhaust all memory, possibly resulting in a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All FreeRADIUS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dialup/freeradius-1.1.6"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=236247#c0)  Josh Bressers    2007-04-12 17:31:12 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS parses certain authentication requests. The upstream description explain it as such: <http://www.freeradius.org/security.html>      2007.04.10 v1.1.5, and earlier - A malicous 802.1x supplicant could send     malformed Diameter format attributes inside of an EAP-TTLS tunnel. The     server would reject the authentication request, but would leak one     VALUE_PAIR data structure, of approximately 300 bytes. If an attacker     performed the attack many times (e.g. thousands or more over a period of     minutes to hours), the server could leak megabytes of memory, potentially     leading to an "out of memory" condition, and early process exit.      We recommend that administrators using EAP-TTLS upgrade immediately.     This bug was found as part of the Coverity Scan project.  The EAP-TTLS support is not enabled by default in any FreeRADIUS installations.   This flaw also affects RHEL 3 and 4.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=236247#c1)  Josh Bressers    2007-04-12 17:31:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 152488](attachment.cgi?id=152488&action=diff "Upstream Patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=152488&action=edit "Upstream Patch") Upstream Patch   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=236247#c11)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-05-10 16:04:13 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report.

#### 2024.07.09BlastRADIUS Vulnerability

Researchers at the University of California, San Diego have [published
an exploit for the RADIUS protocol](https://blastradius.fail). While
attacks on MD5 have been known for a while, people only suspected that
those attacks could be used against RADIUS. [Their
paper](https://www.blastradius.fail/pdf/radius.pdf), or is the first
time that a practical attack has been demonstrated.

**The attack is due to a fundamental design flaw of the RADIUS
protocol. It is not a flaw in any particular implementation or
product. All standards compliant RADIUS clients and servers are
likely vulnerable to this attack, even if they correctly implement
all aspects of the RADIUS protocol.**

We have worked with [Nadia Heninger](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~nadiah/)
and her team to characterise the issue. We have written an
[engineering white
paper](https://networkradius.com/assets/pdf/radius_and_md5_collisions.pdf)
which is available on our [InkBridge Networks](https://inkbridgenetworks.com) corporate site. This paper was used
as the guide by *all RADIUS vendors* for how to fix the problem. The
[updates to the RADIUS
standards](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-radext-deprecating-radius/). are
mandating these changes in all future implementations of RADIUS.

For vendors, we strongly suggest reading that paper before
implementing any solution. Our paper has been reviewed by the
researchers, and they agree that the attack is not possible when our
recommendations are followed. *If a vendor implements any other
solution, they are likely to remain vulnerable to the attack*

There is also have a high-level
[FAQ](https://inkbridgenetworks.com/blastradius/faq) available, along
with [upgrade documentation and
tools](https://inkbridgenetworks.com/blastradius) available on
[InkBrigeNetworks.com](https://inkbridgenetworks.com) web site. That
company is the new name for [Network
RADIUS](https://networkradius.com), which is the company behind
FreeRADIUS.

The truly sad thing is that weâve been trying to fix this issue since 1998.
The first public record we can find of anyone complaining about
this issue is by Alan DeKok (FreeRADIUS founder) in 1998. Alan
further tried to fix it in [RFC 5080, Section
2.2.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5080#section-2.2.2), in 2007.

FreeRADIUS has implemented those suggestions since 2005. *If everyone
had followed these suggestions, then this issue would not exist*.

The big question for network administrators, then, is what to do.

## What to do

In short, *donât panic*. Even if you donât upgrade your NAS
equipment, the attack is expensive, and hard to perform. The odds of
you being attacked in the next little while are small, but non-zero.
You will need to upgrade, but you donât want to upgrade in a panic,
get something wrong, and take your entire network down. Take your
time, plan the upgrade carefully, test the upgrade, and be sure that
your network both works, and is safe.

The attack is hard, because it is a âman in the middleâ attack, which
means that the attacker has to be able to both see, and modify
Access-Request packets. If the attacker can do that, then your
network is already compromised.

Even better, the attack requires substantial CPU resources to do
i.e. $1000 of CPU power *per packet* being attacked, and the attack
isnât even guaranteed. There is also no public exploit available for
âscript kiddiesâ to run. It is extremely unlikely that anyone other
than nation-states have the capability to perform the attack at this
time.

However, if you are running PAP / CHAP / MS-CHAP and RADIUS/UDP over
the Internet, then your users have likely been compromised for
decades. There is little more we can say about that.

In order to fully protect your systems from the attack, you *must*
update *all* RADIUS servers, and *all* RADIUS clients. The attack
relies on a design flaw in the protocol. Fixing it requires updating
all RADIUS implementations to the new behavior. In many cases, you do
not need to panic and upgrade everything immediately. See below for
more details.

Even considering the limited nature of the attack, everyone should
plan on installing all firmware updates for each NAS device (including
switches, routers, firewalls, VPN concentrators, etc.) which uses
RADIUS. The important thing in the short term is to upgrade the
RADIUS servers, determine if your network is still vulnerable, and
then take action to address those vulnerabilities.

Pre-built packages of FreeRADIUS are available on the corporate site
at [packages.networkradius.com](https://packages.networkradius.com).

## How this attack impacts FreeRADIUS.

The biggest recommendation we have is to not panic and try to upgrade
all of the NAS equipment. There is a high likelihood that something
will go wrong. Instead, concentrate on upgrading the RADIUS servers
first.

The simple checklist for testing your local vulnerability status is as
follows:

* Is all RADIUS traffic accounting, and only accounting? The attack
  doesnât affect you. You still need to upgrade everything, but you
  can take your time.
* Are all Access-Request packets sent over RADIUS/TLS (RadSec)? The
  attack doesnât affect you. You still need to upgrade everything,
  but you can take your time.
* Are the RADIUS servers only doing EAP authentication, and no other
  kinds of authentication? The attack doesnât affect you. You still
  need to upgrade everything, but you can take your time.
* Are the RADIUS servers only handling local requests? I.e. none of
  the RADIUS servers in your network are doing proxying? Upgrade
  FreeRADIUS, and then you are protected. You still need to upgrade
  the NAS equipment, but you can take your time.

Otherwise, if your system uses PAP, CHAP, or MS-CHAP over RADIUS/UDP,
you need to upgrade FreeRADIUS, and then reconfigure it with the new
configuration flags. In many cases, you can take your time to upgrade
the NAS equipment.

### New Configuration Options

In order to prevent the attach *while still not breaking things*, we
have added two new configuration options to the `security` subsection
of the `radiusd.conf` file. Simply upgrading will *not set these
flags*, and upgrading *will not affect production networks*.

The first, and most important step is to upgrade FreeRADIUS. If the
checks above show that your system is vulnerable, then upgrade
immediately.

Once the system is upgraded, you can set the new configuration flags. See the `security { ... }` subsection of [radiusd.conf](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/v3.2.x/raddb/radiusd.conf.in). The default configuration on new systems (*not* your current `radiusd.conf`) has documentation on these flags.

The simplest and easiest thing for administrators to do is to edit the
`security` section, and add the following two entries:

```
security {
    ...
    require_message_authenticator = auto
    limit_proxy_state = auto
}

```

Setting these flags will automatically protect *most systems* from the
attack. The only systems which are not protected are ones where there
are multiple different pieces of NAS equipment behind a NAT. In that
case, the only solution is to upgrade all of those pieces of NAS
equipment.

Setting these flags to `auto` will protect the overwhelming majority
of systems. The worst outcome of setting these flags is that on some
unusual network configurations, packets from real clients may be
discarded, or packets from some clients may still be vulnerable to the
attack.

Most regular RADIUS clients do not send `Proxy-State` attributes for
`Access-Request` packets thatwhich they originate. However some
aggregators (e.g. Wireless LAN Controllers) may act as a RADIUS proxy
for requests from their cohort of managed devices, and in such cases
they will provide a `Proxy-State` attribute. For those systems, you
*must* look at the actual packets to determine what to do. It may be
that the only way to fix the vulnerability is to upgrade the WLC, and
set `require_message_authenticator=true`.

This article cannot provide a full description of how to upgrade all
possible networks. There are simply too many different possible
network architectures for a short guide to be helpful to everyone. We
believe hat the above comments will help the vast majority of
organizations to upgrade quickly, easily, and with minimal risk.

There is commercial [BlastRADIUS help and
tools](https://inkbridgenetworks.com/blastradius) available from
[InkBridge Networks](https://inkbridgenetworks.com) (previously
Network RADIUS). That page provides vendor-neutral upgrade
documentation and test tools, which can be used on Windows, OSX, and
Linux. The documentation and test tools will work with any RADIUS
client or server.

## If You Cannot Update

If you cannot update FreeRADIUS immediately, there are still changes
you can make which should help to protect your systems. These changes
will work in *all* versions of FreeRADIUS from 2.0.0 to the latest
3.2.4. Unfortunately, earlier versions of the server are unsupported,
and should not be used.

*These changes should ONLY be made for systems which cannot be updated.*

If the RADIUS client is a proxy server, *and* the client is another
copy of FreeRADIUS 3.0.0 or later, then there are simple steps you can
take. You should be able to set the `require_message_authenticator`
flag in the `client` definition for of the server which receives the
Access-Requests. This flag is available in all versions of FreeRADIUS
from 3.0.0 onwards, and has the same functionality as mandated by the
updated RFCs.

If it is possible to set this flag for all clients, *then your system
is safe, and there is nothing more for you to do right now*.

For systems accepting packets from a NAS, edit each virtual server which handles Access-Request packets, and
look for the authorize section, and add the following âifâ and
âupdateâ text at the top of that section:

```
authorize {
	if (!EAP-Message) {
		update reply {
			Message-Authenticator := 0x00
		}
	}
...

```

Then restart the server for the configuration change to take effect.
This change will cause the server to include a Message-Authenticator
in all responses to Access-Request packets. Depending on the rest of
the local policies, the Message-Authenticator should then be the first
attribute in Access-Accept, Access-Reject, and Access-Challenge
responses. This change is safe to make, and will not affect any other
behavior.

If the system is proxying Access-Request packets, then you need to
make another change.

Look for the pre-proxy section, and add the following âifâ and
âupdateâ text at the top of that section. Note that the âifâ
statement must appear all on one line, and should not be split across
multiple lines.

```
pre-proxy {
	if ((Packet-Type == Access-Request) && !EAP-Message) {
		update proxy-request {
			Message-Authenticator := 0x00
		}
	}
	...

```

Then restart the server for the configuration change to take effect.
This change will cause the server to include a Message-Authenticator
in all proxied Access-Request packets. Depending on the rest of the
local policies, the Message-Authenticator should then be the first
attribute in those packets. This change is safe to make, and will not
affect any other behavior.

The only way to add further protection is to upgrade the RADIUS server
to the most recent version, and to follow the instructions above for
setting `require_message_authenticator` and `limit_proxy_state`.

## Further FreeRADIUS Documentation

The default
[radiusd.conf](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/v3.2.x/raddb/radiusd.conf.in)
file contains comments which document these options, and describe how
they work. Please consult that file for a more complete explanation.

## Vulnerable Versions

As this is a vulnerability in the protocol, *all* versions of FreeRADIUS are vulnerable. We have supplied pre-built [packages](https://packages.networkradius.com) for 3.0.27, and 3.2.5.

There are no patches availalbe for version 2, version 1, or earlier versions of the server. Those products have been deprecated for over a decade, and are all marked âend of lifeâ.

If you are still running an older version, the short-term fix is to update the configuration to add Message-Authenticator as the *first* attribute in all Access-Accept, Access-Reject, and Access-Challenge packets. We do not describe how to do that here.

The correct long-term fix for people running deprecated versions of the server is to upgrade to a supported version.

#### 2022.04.22Information leakage in EAP-PWD

The EAP-PWD function *compute\_password\_element()* leaks information
about the password which allows an attacker to substantially reduce
the size of an offline dictionary attack.

The issue was found by [Mohamed Sabt](http://people.irisa.fr/Mohamed.Sabt/) and his team at the University of
Rennes.

Similar issues were found and fixed in `hostapd` and `iwd`.

The issue was fixed in [commit 9e5e8f2f](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/9e5e8f2f).

#### 2022.04.22Crash on unknown option in EAP-SIM

When an EAP-SIM supplicant sends an unknown SIM option, the server
will try to look that option up in the internal dictionaries. This
lookup will fail, but the SIM code will not check for that failure.
Instead, it will dereference a NULL pointer, and cause the server to
crash.

All versions of FreeRADIUS from 0.9.3 to 3.0.25 which have the EAP-SIM
module *manually configured* are affected.

The EAP-SIM module is not enabled in the default configuration. There
is no sample configuration for the module, and no documentation on how
to get it to work.

As a result, we expect that few sites are affected by this issue.

Any site which has configured EAP-SIM is vulnerable. Any malicious
EAP-SIM peer can crash the server. No other actions other than the
crash are possible.

This issue was found by Shane Guan, and [reported](https://lists.freeradius.org/pipermail/freeradius-users/2022-February/101382.html) to the freeradius-users mailing list.

The issue was fixed in [commit f1cdbb](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/f1cdbb33ec61c4a64a).

#### 2022.04.22Crash on invalid abinary data

A malicious RADIUS client or home server can send a malformed
`abinary` attribute which can cause the server to crash.

All versions of FreeRADIUS from 0.0.1 to 3.0.25 are affected.

This crash is *not* exploitable by end users. Only systems which are
in the RADIUS circle of trust can send these malformed attributes to a
server. No actions other than a crash are possible.

As a result, the severity of this issue is low. A malicious RADIUS
client or home server can do many worse things than crash the server.
For example, it could cause all users to be authenticated, or cause
all users to be rejected, or it could lie about all accounting data.

This issue was found during automated fuzzing of the source code.

The issue was fixed in [commit 0ec2b39](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/0ec2b39d260e).

#### 2021.12.16FreeRADIUS is NOT affected by the log4j issues

[CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228)

FreeRADIUS is *not* affected by the log4j issues.

However, RADIUS servers will try to authenticate any user who tries to
connect. And the `User-Name` field is under complete control of an
attacker. If *any* of the RADIUS logs go through a system which uses
log4j, then *your site is likely vulnerable*.

We do not recommend changing the RADIUS server configuration in order
to try to âwork aroundâ the log4j issue. The best solution is to fix
the underlying problem.

#### 2019.05.25Logrotate Issues

[CVE-2019-10143](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10143)

We disagree with this CVE. In the GitHub report [1], the RedHat
reporter claims:

> we are aware of a way to exploit this,

No description of this alleged exploit was shared with us at our
security contact.

Our security contact is âsecurity@freeradius.orgâ, which has been
active for almost 20 years. This address and security instructions
are available on our web site at:

https://freeradius.org/security/

In the GitHub report, RedHat further claims that exploitation

> â¦ requires the attacker to already have âhigh privilegesâ (that is, he needs to have access to the radiusd user)

Which demonstrates that this issue is largely nonsense. A full explanation follows.

While the FreeRADIUS server runs as user/group âradiusd/radiusdâ, that
account has no login shell, no home directory, and no default
password. The account is used solely to run the FreeRADIUS server,
and to control ownership of configuration files and log files. These
files are typically administered solely by the ârootâ user.

As such, the CVE can be better stated as âif the root user
misconfigures FreeRADIUS, then the RADIUS server can later elevate
privileges to rootâ.

We have to ask why the ârootâ user would need to leverage a
less-privileged account in order to gain ârootâ permissions.

Further, anyone who can operate as the RADIUS server can perform all
RADIUS authentication and authorization. i.e. authenticating all
users on the network, including unknown and malicious users.

There is at this time no known exploit which would let malicious users
gain access to the âradiusdâ user. Therefore as discussed here, there
is simply no way for anyone to *gain* privileges through this alleged
issue.

In addition, there also appears to be disagreement within RedHat about
the severity and scope of this issue. The original reporter [2]
states:

> The su directive to logrotate ensures that log rotation happens under the
> owner of the logs. Otherwise, logrotate runs as root:root, potentially
> enabling privilege escalation if a RCE is discovered against the
> FreeRADIUS daemon.
>
> This attack avenue seems quite unlikely to me.

We agree. We take great care in securing FreeRADIUS. We use multiple
source code analyzers and fuzzing tests.

Even the most charitable interpretation of this issue shows that the
vulnerability is theoretical in nature, and is not currently
exploitable.

As such, we disagree with the issuance of this CVE. We also express
dismay at the process by which this CVE was issued. We recommend that
security âexpertsâ follow best practices in discussing issues with
authors prior to requesting spurious CVEs.

#### 2019.04.10Authentication bypass in EAP-PWD

The EAP-PWD module is vulnerable to multiple issues, including
authentication bypass. This module is *not* enabled in the default
configuration. Administrators must manually enable it for their server
to be vulnerable. Version 3.0.0 through 3.0.18 are are affected.

The EAP-PWD module is vulnerable to side-channel and cache-based
attacks. The issue is discussed in more in Hostap
[2019-2](https://w1.fi/security/2019-2/). The attack requires the
attacker to be able to run a program on the target device. This is not
commonly the case on an authentication server (EAP server), so the
most likely target for this would be a client device using EAP-PWD.
It is not clear at this time if the attack is possible between
multiple virtual machines on the same hardware.

Other issues with EAP-PWD were found earlier, and patched in
[Hostap](https://w1.fi/cgit/hostap/commit/?id=22ac3dfebf7b25a3aae02f9b4f69025bb4173137).
The FreeRADIUS team was not notified of these attacks until recently.
We have now patched FreeRADIUS to address these issues.

Additional issues were found by Mathy Vanhoef as part of a deep
investigation into EAP-PWD. He also supplied patches to address the
issues. His report is included below. This issue is recorded in
[VU#871675](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/871675/)

We have released version 3.0.19 to address these issues.

# Report from Mathy VanHoef

This report summarizes possible implementations-specific vulnerabilities in
EAP-pwd clients or servers. Additionally, it summarizes two design flaws in
EAP-pwd that all implementations are likely vulnerable to (note that you may
have already received information about these design flaws previously).

## Implementation-Specific Flaws

While investigating 4 different EAP-pwd implementations, we discovered that all
4 were vulnerable to invalid curve and reflection attacks. Although these are
implementation-specific flaws, this indicates both vulnerabilities might be
present in other implementations of EAP-pwd as well. We therefore recommend to
audit EAP-pwd implementations for these two vulnerabilities.

### Invalid Curve Attack

The first implementation-specific vulnerability is an invalid curve attack, and
would allow an attacker to authenticate as any user (without knowing the
password). The problem is that on the reception of an EAP-PWD Commit frame, a
vulnerable EAP-pwd implementation does not verify whether the received elliptic
curve point is valid. To fix this vulnerability, it must be checked that the
received point is on the elliptic curve, and that it is not the point at
infinity (e.g. using the function `EC_POINT_is_on_curve` and
`EC_POINT_is_at_infinity`). Additionally, EAP-pwd implementations must check
that the received scalar s is within the range 1 < s < r, where r is the order
of the elliptic curve being used. If the scalar is not within this range, or
the curve point is not valid, the handshake should be aborted.

An adversary can exploit the above vulnerability by sending a scalar equal to
zero (or equal to the order of the elliptic curve), and by sending a specially
crafted (invalid) elliptic curve point. This combination causes the negotiated
session key to have a very small range of possible values. The adversary can
then test each possible key until the correct session key is found. We
successfully confirmed this attack against both vulnerable client-side and
server-side implementations.

### Reflection Attack

The second implementation-specific vulnerability might allow âfakeâ
authentications. More precisely, an attacker can reflect the received scalar
and element (i.e. elliptic curve point) that was sent by the server, in its own
commit message, and subsequently reflect the confirm value as well. This causes
the adversary to successfully authenticate as the victim. Fortunately, the
adversary will not learn the negotiated session key, meaning the adversary
cannot actually perform any actions as the victim.

This vulnerability can be patched by comparing the received scalar and curve
point to the one generated by the server (i.e. by comparing it to the element
and scalar that was sent to the client). If either of them are the same, the
handshake should be aborted.

We successfully tested this attack against vulnerable client-side
implementations of EAP-pwd.

## Design Flaws

We also discovered design flaws in EAP-pwd which likely affect all
implementations. Note that you may have already been informed about this in a
separate announcement. In any case, we discovered the following two issues:

### Timing Attacks

The password generation algorithm (the âhunting and peckingâ algorithm) uses a
variable number of iterations to find the password element. The precise number
of iterations depends on the password being used, and on the token generated by
the server. This means sensitive information is leaked if the adversary can
measure how many iterations it took to derive the password element. Although
making these measurements is far from trivial, obtaining this information
allows the adversary to carry out a password partitioning attack (this is
practically the same as an offline dictionary attack).

A backwards-compatible countermeasure is to always perform 40 iterations in the
password generation algorithm. How to do this is explain in more detail in
section 4.4.1 of RFC 8492, which describes a very close variant of the EAP-pwd
handshake: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8492#section-4.4.1 Additionally,
determining whether thereâs a quadratic residue should be done in a blinded
manner. How this can be done is also explained in section 4.4.1 of RFC 8492.

### Cache-Based Attacks

On top of the above timing attack countermeasures, implementations must also
incorporate defenses against cache-based attacks. This is because the password
generation algorithm (the âhunting and peckingâ algorithm) contains conditional
branches based on secret values. If an adversary can determine which branch of
such an if-then-else branch was taken, they can learn whether the password
element was found in a specific iteration of this algorithm. In practice we
found that, if an adversary can run unprivileged code on the victim machine, we
were able to use cache-based attacks to determine which branch was taken in an
iteration of the password generation algorithm. More concretely, an adversary
can determine whether the password element was found in a specific iteration or
not. This information can be abused to perform a password partitioning attack
(this is similar to an offline dictionary attack).

Note that this cache-based attack is only possible if an adversary can run
unprivileged code on the victimâs machine (e.g. from an android application
that doesnât have special privileges, or from a co-located virtual machine).

A backward-compatible countermeasure is to replace conditional branches that
depend on secret values with constant-time select utilities. See the file
`constant_time.md` for examples on how to do this in C. Implementations must
also use a constant time Legendre symbol computation.

#### 2017.07.17Multiple issues found by Guido Vranken

We requested that Guido Vranken do fuzz testing against the
server. He found issues in all versions of the server. These
issues are documented on the [fuzzer](/security/fuzzer-2017.html)
page.

#### 2017.05.26Erroneous Session Resumption

We discovered that the server could be convinced to permit TLS
session resumption before the authentication finished. A partial fix
was put into 3.0.13. Pavel Kankovsky verified that the fix was
insufficient, and provided a tool to test the issue. A better fix
was put into the server, and was released in version 3.0.14.

The original EAP-TLS code would refuse to resume sessions unless
there were policy attributes in the session cache. This check was
put in place to work around this issue with the OpenSSL API. At some
point, the code was changed to cache policy attributes by default,
which opened up the vulnerability. Given the long history of the
server, it is not clear when that change was made.

**FIX:** The short-term fix is to disable session resumption in the
`cache` subsection of the `eap` module.

We believe that this issue affects version 2.1.1 through
2.1.7 inclusive. Other versions seem to be unaffected. We remind
users that versions 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 2.0.x, 2.1.x, and 2.2.x are old
and unsupported. Patches for those versions will not be released, as
the issue can be corrected with a minor configuration change. We
also note that prior to version 3, the session cache was disabled by
default, and required administrator intervention to enable it.

The v4.0.x branch is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying
code has been refactored to hide the TLS session data until the
final EAP Success is sent, in the Access-Accept. This change means
that the issue is impossible to reoccur in the future.

At this time, we have not had reports of the issue being exploited
in the wild.

#### 2017.05.16FreeRADIUS server scanned by PVS-Studio

The people at [PVS-Studio](https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/) were kind enough to give us a temporary
license so that we could scan FreeRADIUS. We scanned the v3.0.x
branch of the server, as of [commit
a7df94](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/3047fc60a7df94c101e525b2e9a4b4a184232cec).

You can read our write-up [here](/security/pvs-studio.html).

#### 2015.09.16Tunnel-Password Vulnerabilities

Denis Andzakovic found issues with the decryption of very
long Tunnel-Passwords. The decryption routines could walk off of the
end of a buffer, and write to adjacent addresses. The data being
written is not under control of an attacker. The end result is
usually a crash of the server.

The initial report was for version 3.0. We determined that the
v3.1.x branch in git is also vulnerable. Version 2 has similar code
for Tunnel-Password, which we were not able to exploit. However, for
safety, all currently supported versions of the server were fixed.

The packet decoder in FreeRADIUS ensures that the only time this
issue is exploitable is when a proxy server receives a long
Tunnel-Password attribute in the reply from a home server. The
attack cannot be performed by a RADIUS client, or an end user. As
such, the exploitability of the attack is limited to systems within
the trusted RADIUS environment.

We are releasing version 2.2.9 and version 3.0.10 to correct
the issue.

#### 2015.06.22Revoked intermediate certificates are not properly validated

oCert-CVE 2015-4680

All versions which implement EAP-TLS, prior to 2.2.8 and 3.0.9 do
not check intermediate CAs for revocation. We have put patches into
the version 2 and version 3 branches to fix these issues.

We expect that this issue has minimal effect on the majority of
RADIUS systems. If you are using a self-signed CA for 802.1X, this
issue does not seriously affect you, as only you can issue
intermediate certificates. If you are using certificates from a
public CA, then your configuration already permits third parties to
issue certificates which will be accepted by your RADIUS server.

i.e. The act of using a public CA cert in RADIUS can open your
systems to security issues which are larger, and much worse than
this one. The fix for this particular issue does not change the
underlying security problem behind using a public CA.

Our analysis of the issue led us to disagree with the analysis done
by oCert, and the (alleged) original vendor who made the report. We
a requested a response to our analysis, and oCert refused. We
requested that the public notice contain an accurate description of
the issue and itâs impact. oCert again refused. After repeated
messages, the response from Andrea Barisani of oCert was:

```
The reporter disagrees with your assessment yet cannot share details
about their setup, oCERT has no wishes to do technical support on
their setup as we just care about the reported bug.

```

Which is missing the point. We never asked to do âtechnical support
on their setupâ. We asked for an accurate description of the issue
and itâs impact. oCert refused, whichs means that they do not, in
fact, âcare about the reported bugâ.

We wanted to work together to come up with an accurate description
of the issue, including itâs impact. It was clear that oCert was had
no such goal. They saw their work as simply taking the original
report, and forwarding it to a wider audience (including us).

We can only conclude that our analysis is correct, and that the
original report, and the summary published by oCert is largely
wrong. We can also recommend that people avoid oCert, as they are
unwilling to work with authors to publish accurate reports.

#### 2015.04.04EAP-PWD Vulnerabilities

The EAP-PWD module performed insufficient validation on packets
received from an EAP peer. This module is *not* enabled in the
default configuration. Administrators must manually enable it for
their server to be vulnerable. Only versions 3.0 up to 3.0.8
are affected.

These issues were found by Jouni Malinen as part of investigating
[2015-4](http://w1.fi/security/2015-4/) for HostAP.

* The EAP-PWD packet length is not checked before the first byte
  is dereferenced. A zero-length EAP-PWD packet will cause the
  module to dereference a NULL pointer, and will cause the server
  to crash.
* The commit message payload length is not validated before the
  packet is decoded. This can result in a read overflow in
  the server.
* The confirm message payload length is not validated before the
  packet is decoded. This can result in a read overflow in
  the server.
* A strcpy() was used to pack a C string into an EAP-PWD packet.
  This would result in an over-run of the destination buffer by
  one byte.

#### 2014.09.24SSLv3 (POODLE)

[POODLE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#POODLE_attack) attack.

FreeRADIUS is *not* vulnerable to this issue. All version to at
least 1.0.0 (and possibly earlier) require TLSv1.

#### 2014.09.24Bash (Shellshock)

[Shellshock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_%28software_bug%29) bug.

Systems running FreeRADIUS *may be* vulnerable to this bug. The
default configuration does not execute any external programs or
shell scripts. However, administrators who have configured the
server to execute shell scripts **must** upgrade their version of
`bash` to a version which is not vulnerable.

#### 2014.02.17Stack overflow in the PAP module

The CVE notification is
[CVE-2014-2015](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2015)

The PAP module takes a âknown goodâ password (e.g. Crypt-Password),
and compares it to the password entered by the user (e.g.
User-Password). In cases where the âknown goodâ password was very
long, insufficient input validation was performed. An administrator
who controlled the password store could enter long passwords, and
cause the server to crash.

#### 2012.11.10Unix module allows expired passwords

The CVE notification is
[CVE-2011-4966](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-4966).

It was found that the âunixâ module ignored the password expiration
setting in â/etc/shadowâ. The default configuration does not use the
âunixâ module, so there is no issue for most deployments. However,
if the server was configured to use this module for authentication,
users with an expired password could successfully authenticate, even
though their access should have been denied. We recommend managing
users in a database, instead of leveraging /etc/passwd. The fact
that a user has login access to a machine does not necessarily mean
that they can use RADIUS for other kinds of network access.

#### 2012.09.10Overflow in EAP-TLS

The CVE notification is
[CVE-2012-3547](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3547).
The issue was found by Timo Warns, and communicated
to security@freeradius.org. A sample exploit for the issue was
included in the notification.

We recommend all administrators using EAP and 2.1.10, 2.1.11,
2.1.12, or the git âmasterâ branch upgrade immediately.

The vulnerability was created in [commit
a368a6f4f4aaf](https://github.com/FreERADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/a368a6f4f4aaf)
on August 18, 2010. Vulnerable versions include 2.1.10, 2.1.11, and
2.1.12. Also anyone running the git âmasterâ branch after August 18,
2010 is vulnerable.

All sites using TLS-based EAP methods and the above versions
are vulnerable. The only configuration change which can avoid the
issue is to disable EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and PEAP.

An external attacker can use this vulnerability to over-write the
stack frame of the RADIUS server, and cause it to crash. In
addition, more sophisticated attacks may gain additional privileges
on the system running the RADIUS server.

This attack does not require local network access to the
RADIUS server. It can be done by an attacker through a WiFi Access
Point, so long as the Access Point is configured to use 802.1X
authentication with the RADIUS server.

We scanned the rlm\_eap\_tls.c file with the LLVM checker-267, taken
from http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/. It did not find this issue.
However, a Coverity scan did discover it.

#### 2011.09.22Manually enabling OCSP has no effect

This issue is applicable only to version 2.1.11.

The CVE notification is
[CVE-2011-2701](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-2701).
The discoverer notified us and sent a patch.

The OCSP functionality in 2.1.11 could be enabled manually, but it
would never mark certificates as revoked. As such, it did not behave
as expected.

Since this issue requires manually enabling OCSP, itâs severity
is low. The recommended solution is to upgrade to version 2.1.12.

#### 2010.10.08FreeRADIUS may crash if database goes down

If FreeRADIUS depends on a database, and the database goes down for
extended periods, the server may crash. This issue applies to versions
2.0.0 through 2.1.9. This issue is not externally exploitable.

The CVE notification is
[CVE-2010-3697](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-3697).

As with many such notifications, the issuer did not communicate with
us before releasing the alleged vulnerability. We also disagree with
their description of the problem.

The short description of this problem is that any administrator who
can (a) take the database down, or (b) disrupt communication between
FreeRADIUS and the database can prevent FreeRADIUS from
operating correctly. This result should not be a surprise.

In normal operation, when the server stops responding to
packets (i.e. because the database is down), the NAS will stop
sending it packets, and will fail over to another server. In
addition, our tests indicate that this issue occurs only when the
database is down for extended periods of time, and the server
receives many millions of packets during that time. i.e. the problem
will not occur in most deployments.

There is no possibility for privilege escalation, or access to the
system running FreeRADIUS. The issue is marked ânetwork exploitableâ
in the CVE database because it requires the network to be *down* for
the attack to work.

Our recommendation is to upgrade to the latest version of the
server. We also recommend that mission-critical systems
be monitored. If they go offline for extended periods, they should
be restarted.

#### 2010.10.08Code modifications to the server can cause it to crash

This issue is applicable only to version 2.1.9.

The CVE notification is
[CVE-2010-3696](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-3696).

The issuer did not communicate with us before releasing the alleged vulnerability,
and we disagree with their description of the problem.

The DHCP functionality in 2.1.9 is *not* enabled by default.
Enabling it requires code modifications, a complete re-build and
re-install of the server, and a manual enabling of DHCP in
the configuration. Further, the DHCP functionality is marked
âexperimentalâ in this release. As such, it should be used only on
trusted networks.

This issue is exploitable whenever FreeRADIUS has had DHCP
functionality enabled, and where the administrator has manually
configured the server to accept DHCP packets. Any DHCP packet with a
âRelay Agentâ sub-option can cause FreeRADIUS to enter an
infinite loop.

Our recommendation is to run experimental features only in
trusted networks.

#### 2010.02.03Apple Mac OS X server misconfiguration

[CVE-2010-0524](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-0524) -
This issue only affects Mac OS X Server systems.

Apple had apparently configured FreeRADIUS to accept all âwell
knownâ Certificate Authorities as valid for EAP-TLS. This
configuration permitted almost anyone to create a client certificate
for use with EAP-TLS, which would then be accepted by Mac OS X
Server systems.

We recommend that the list of Certificate Authorities configured in
FreeRADIUS be audited, and kept as small as possible.

#### 2009.09.09Server crash with Tunnel-Password attribute

Anyone who can send packets to the server can crash it by sending
a Tunnel-Password attribute in an Access-Request packet. This
vulnerability is not otherwise exploitable. We have released 1.1.8
to correct this vulnerability.

This issue is similar to the previous Tunnel-Password issue
noted below. The vulnerable versions are 1.1.3 through 1.1.7.
Version 2.x is not affected.

#### 2007.04.10Memory leak in EAP-TTLS can cause server crash

This issue affects version 1.1.5 and earlier.

A malicous 802.1x supplicant could send malformed Diameter format
attributes inside of an EAP-TTLS tunnel. The server would reject the
authentication request, but would leak one `VALUE_PAIR` data
structure, of approximately 300 bytes. If an attacker performed the
attack many times (e.g. thousands or more over a period of minutes
to hours), the server could leak megabytes of memory, potentially
leading to an âout of memoryâ condition, and early process exit.

We recommend that administrators using EAP-TTLS upgrade immediately.

This bug was found as part of the
[Coverity](http://www.coverity.com/)
[Scan](http://scan.coverity.com) project.

#### 2007.01.02Stack overflow in rlm\_smb means admins can write to server config

[SMB\_Handle\_Type SMB\_Connect\_Server](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/455678/100/0/threaded).

While the summary is superficially correct, and there is a stack
overflow in rlm\_smb, the issue is [less
problematic](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/455812/100/0/threaded)
than it sounds.

[CVE-2007-0080](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2007-0080)
has been updated with our statement.

[SecurityTracker Alert ID: 1017463](http://securitytracker.com/alerts/2007/Jan/1017463.html)
has been updated with our statement.

[freeradius-smbconnectserver-bo (31248)](http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/31248)
has been updated to no longer claim the issue is
remotely exploitable. They do not, however, include our [vendor
statement](https://lists.freeradius.org/pipermail/freeradius-devel/2007-January/010717.html),
though they do reference it. They also list the issue as âHigh
Riskâ, and âGain Privilegesâ, which is *NOT TRUE*, for the reasons
outlined below.

In summary, the issue is *not remotely exploitable*. It is
exploitable by local administrators who have write access to the
server configuration files. If an attacker can write to the server
configuration files, they can configure the server to run
arbitrary programs. Exploiting the server via a stack overflow would
be unnecessary.

The solution to this âvulnerabilityâ, of course, is to ensure that
only the correct people are given write access to the server
configuration files.

#### 2006.03.20Insufficient input validation in MS-CHAP

A validation issue exists with the EAP-MSCHAPv2 module in all versions
from 1.0.0 (where the module first appeared) to 1.1.0. Insufficient
input validation was being done in the EAP-MSCHAPv2 state machine. A
malicious attacker could manipulate their EAP-MSCHAPv2 client state
machine to potentially convince the server to bypass
authentication checks. This bypassing could also result in the
server crashing. We recommend that administrators
upgrade immediately.

#### 2005.09.09Multiple SQL vulnerabilities

Multiple issues exist with version 1.0.4, and all prior versions of
the server. Externally exploitable vulnerabilities exist only for
sites that use the `rlm_sqlcounter` module. Those sites may be
vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, similar to the issues
noted below. All sites that have not deployed the `rlm_sqlcounter`
module are not vulnerable to external exploits. However, we still
recommend that all sites upgrade to version 1.0.5.

The issues are:

* SQL Injection attack in the `rlm_sqlcounter` module.
* Buffer overflow in the `rlm_sqlcounter` module, that may cause a
  server crash.
* Buffer overflow while expanding %t, that may cause a
  server crash.

These issues were found by Primoz Bratanic. As the `rlm_sqlcounter`
module is marked âexperimentalâ in the server source, it is not
enabled or configured in most sites. As a result, we believe that
the number of vulnerable sites is low.

Additional issues, not externally exploitable, were found by Suse. A
full response to their report is available
[here](/security/20050909-response-to-suse.txt). A related post to
the `vendor-sec` mailing list is found
[here](/security/20050909-vendor-sec.txt).

#### 2005.05.01Two SQL vulnerabilities

Two vulnerabilities in the SQL module exist in all versions prior
to 1.0.3. Sites not using the SQL module are not affected by
this issue. However, we still recommend that all sites upgrade to
version 1.0.3.

The issues are:

* Buffer overflow - A long string could overflow an internal
  buffer in the SQL module, and write two bytes of text [0-9a-f]
  past the end of the buffer. The server may exit when this
  happens, resulting in a DoS attack. Depending on the local
  configuration of the server, this may occur before a user
  is authenticated. This vulnerability is externally exploitable,
  but can not result in the execution of arbitrary code.
* SQL injection attacks - The SQL module suffers from SQL
  injection attacks in the `group_membership_query`,
  `simul_count_query`, and `simul_verify_query`
  configuration entries. The first query is exploitable if your
  site is configured to use the `SQL-Group` attribute in any
  module in the `authorize` section of `radiusd.conf`. The last
  two queries are exploitable only if your site has user names
  that contain a single quote character (`'`).

#### 2004.09.14Multiple external DoS attacks

Multiple external DoS attacks exist in the server. These are related to the attacks
below, in 0.9.2, but were not caught then. The vulnerabilities are
fixed in 1.0.1, and in all later versions of the server. The
vulnerabilities are not exploitable, but can be used to remotely
crash the server.

#### 2003.11.20Externally exploitable root compromise in rlm\_smb

There is an externally exploitable root compromise in rlm\_smb, through a stack
overflow when a password greater than 128 bytes referenced by
the module. The module is not built or installed by default, so we
have not released a 0.9.4. This vulnerability is fixed in the CVS
snapshots, and will be included in any later release of the server.

#### 2003.10.15Crash upon receipt of Tunnel-Password attribute

Anyone who can send packets to the server can crash it by sending a
Tunnel-Password attribute in an Access-Request packet. This vulnerability
is not otherwise exploitable. We have released 0.9.3 to correct
this vulnerability.

#### 2002.07.26Kerberos module may grant incorrect access

The Kerberos module may grant access to a user whose Kerberos ticket
cannot be verified against the server principal. We have released 0.7.1
to correct this vulnerability.

#### 2001.12.17Multiple RADIUS vulnerabilities

[CA-2002-06](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-06.html).
Multiple vulnerabilities in multiple RADIUS implementations. We have
released 0.4 to correct these vulnerabilities.

#### 2014.04.08OpenSSL Heartbleed

[Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/) bug.

OpenSSL has a major security issue, seen in to
[CVE-2014-0160](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160%0A).
The issue mainly affects servers such as SMTPS or HTTPS, which allow
random IP addresses to connect to them via TLS. Those sites must
assume that all information available to the system using TLS has
been compromised.

Based on further information from Jouni Malinen, it appears that
both Version 2 and Version 3 of FreeRADIUS are vulnerable to
the attack. It is likely that earlier versions of the server are
vulnerable, too.

The problem appears to be that OpenSSL has already allowed invalid
reads by the time that FreeRADIUS detects the invalid heartbeat, and
closes the connection. The benefit of the way FreeRADIUS uses
OpenSSL is that the attack appears to be limited to reading ~1K of
data from the stack, when the server receives the
malicious heartbeat. This limitation mitigates the attack, but does
not remove the possibility of exposing private information.

We recommend that all administrators upgrade OpenSSL immediately.

Administrators can detect âheartbleedâ attacks by looking in their
logs for a message containing the text `Invalid ACK received: 24`.
If such a message is seen, it means that the attack has
been attempted. You should upgrade your version of
OpenSSL immediately.

We suggest that all administrators upgrade all of their systems to a
version of OpenSSL which is not vulnerable to this attack. Sites
which allow random IPs to connect to a TLS server (e.g. SMTPS
or HTTPS) should assume that all information available to those
servers has been stolen from those systems. This information
includes user credentials, keys for private certificates, cookies
sent over HTTPS, etc.

We have updated FreeRADIUS (all versions) so that it refuses to
start when it detects the vulnerable versions of OpenSSL.

**v3.0.x** - Administrators can over-ride this check by setting
`allow_vulnerable_openssl = CVE-2014-0160` in the `security`
subsection of radiusd.conf.

**v2.2.x** - Administrators can over-ride this check by setting
`allow_vulnerable_openssl = yes` in the `security` subsection
of radiusd.conf.

#### 2012.04.19Versions of OpenSSL are vulnerable to malformed certificates

The CVE notification is
[CVE-2012-2110](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-2110).

We recommend all administrators using certificates with FreeRADIUS
upgrade their OpenSSL to a secure version. For details, see the
[OpenSSL notification](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20120419.txt)

We emphasize that this is *not* a bug in FreeRADIUS. FreeRADIUS uses
OpenSSL for many of itâs cryptographic operations, and as such, is
at the mercy of any problems in OpenSSL.

#### 2008.05.13SSL keys may be guessable

A bug added to OpenSSL on
[Debian](http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html)
and
[Ubuntu](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2008-May/000705.html)
systems means that SSL keys on those systems may be guessable.

We recommend that administrators using OpenSSL on Debian or Ubuntu
upgrade immediately. We also recommend re-generating any SSL
certificates used in RADIUS systems, if those certificates were
created on a Debian or Ubuntu system since 2006.

We emphasize that this is *not* a bug in FreeRADIUS. FreeRADIUS uses
OpenSSL for many of itâs cryptographic operations, and as such, is
at the mercy of any problems in OpenSSL.

#### FreeRADIUS Security

##### Defensive Programming

All input is sanity-checked before use.

##### Clean code

There are no C compiler warnings in the build. Builds performed by developers have -Werror set, so that new errors are not introduced.

##### Builds with multiple compilers

We use both GCC and CLANG for all builds. Each compiler produces a slightly different set of warnings. As seen above, no warnings from any compiler are allowed in the build.

##### Builds on multiple operating systems

We always build on macOS, Ubuntu, CentOS/Rocky Linux and FreeBSD.

##### Builds are done with every single module, and multiple feature permutations

There is no portion of the server which has "code rot" because it has not been built for years.

##### Continuous testing

The src/tests/ directory has a growing set of tests for server functionality. These tests help ensure that new commits do not accidentally break existing functionality

##### Continuous integration

Commits are built and tested via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/actions)

##### Static analysis (3X!)

Builds are performed weekly with Coverity. Builds are performed daily with Clang static analyzer and cppcheck. The server must build with no errors before it can be released.

These practices are not perfect. The test suite is growing, but it does not cover all of the servers functionality. As a result, the latest releases may still have bugs. Version 2 is "end of life" (EOL), and has new releases only when security issues mandate it. Version 3 is the "long term support" stable release. New releases are limited to bug fixes and minor new features. The git "master" branch will become version 4 at some point, but is not yet available as a released version.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Geert Bevin    2002-01-04 18:14:07 UTC  ``` /etc/gnome dir is created outside of image dir. Too tired to continue to look for the cause. Will do so asap. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-12 10:45:41 UTC  ``` Works fine here.  Was it a fresh installation ? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-12 15:53:20 UTC  ``` gnome-font-install, a util that comes with gnome-print, has '/etc/gnome' hardcoded.  Fixing it will break general use (will have '${D}/etc/gnome') hardcoded.  I will see if there is an easy solution. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-13 23:54:13 UTC  ``` I noticed that too, first time I tried it violated sandbox, but after merging without the sandbox once it didn't violate the sandbox when running with it again. I guess there is some file being written first time and then it just checks that it's there.  ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-17 19:03:36 UTC  ``` If /etc/gnome is not around it will try to create it and generate the sandbox violation. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Martin Schlemmer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-20 03:44:51 UTC  ``` Removed the running of gnome-font-install from the 'make install' process, and added it to pkg_postinst(). ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

Moderate: freeradius security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0338)

## Topic

Updated freeradius packages that fix a memory leak flaw are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

FreeRADIUS is a high-performance and highly configurable free RADIUS server
designed to allow centralized authentication and authorization for a network.

A memory leak flaw was found in the way FreeRADIUS parses certain
authentication requests. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted
authentication request which could cause FreeRADIUS to leak a small amount
of memory. If enough of these requests are sent, the FreeRADIUS daemon
would consume a vast quantity of system memory leading to a possible denial
of service. (CVE-2007-2028)

Users of FreeRADIUS should update to these erratum packages, which contain a
backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>
