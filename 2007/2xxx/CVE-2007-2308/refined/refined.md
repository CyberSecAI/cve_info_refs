Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2308:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `cas.php` script of FloweRS v2.0. Specifically, the `rok` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter, which could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other client-side attacks.
- Specifically, the provided proof of concept demonstrates an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL, specifically the `rok` parameter in the `cas.php` script. 
- By embedding JavaScript code within the `rok` parameter, an attacker can achieve XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious script embedded in the vulnerable parameter.
- No specific authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. It is a remote, unauthenticated attack.
