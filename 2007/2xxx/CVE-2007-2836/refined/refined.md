```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability stems from an insufficiently restrictive regular expression used to validate session IDs in the `session.rb` file of Hiki. This allows an attacker to inject directory traversal sequences into the session ID.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Directory traversal: The primary weakness is the ability to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the session ID.
- Insufficient input validation: The regular expression used for session ID validation is not strict enough, allowing for unexpected characters and sequences.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary file deletion: By manipulating the session ID, an attacker can cause the Hiki application to delete arbitrary files on the server that the Hiki user (often the web server user) has write access to.

Attack vectors:
- Remote exploitation: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted session ID to the Hiki server.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- No authentication is needed: The attacker does not need any user credentials or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Hiki server.
