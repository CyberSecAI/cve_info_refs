Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability. The application includes a file based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is used to construct the path to the included file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly uses the `id` parameter from the URL within an `include()` function without any input validation or sanitization.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate or sanitize the user-supplied `id` parameter, making it possible to include arbitrary files from remote locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Data Theft and System Compromise:** Successful RFI can allow the attacker to gain control of the server, potentially leading to data theft, defacement, or further malicious activities.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Given the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, attackers can gain full system control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
   -  Example: `http://[target]/?id=[REMOTEFILE]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No special privileges or authentication is required for exploitation.
- The attacker must have access to a publicly available web server which hosts the malicious PHP script.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable software is "Request It : Song Request System 1.0b".
- The vulnerability was discovered by "hackberry.ath.cx".
- The CVSS Base Score is 6.8/10, with a high Exploitability Subscore (8.6/10), indicating the ease of exploitation.
- The impact scores are: Confidentiality impact - Partial, Integrity impact - Partial, Availability impact - Partial.
- A Google Dork was provided to find vulnerable instances: `"[ Request us to play you a song ]"`
- The code snippet `if(isset($id)) { if($id == 'home') { $id = "list"; } include($id.".php"); }` illustrates how the vulnerability occurs, the `id` parameter is directly used to include a php file.
