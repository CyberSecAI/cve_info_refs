How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-031 - Critical

## Vulnerability in the Windows Schannel Security Package Could Allow Remote Code Execution (935840)

Published: June 12, 2007

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This critical security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the Secure Channel (Schannel) security package in Windows. The Schannel security package implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Internet standard authentication protocols. This vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Web page using an Internet Web browser or used an application that makes use of SSL/TLS. However, attempts to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in the Internet Web browser or application exiting. The system would not be able to connect to Web sites or resources using SSL or TLS until a restart of the system.

This is a critical security update for supported editions of Windows XP, important for editions of Windows 2003, and moderate for editions of Windows 2000. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

This security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the client parses server-key exchange data sent from the server. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.

**Known Issues.** None

**Update Replacement.** This security update does not replace a prior security update.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

In the following tables of affected and non-affected software, software versions that are not listed are past their support lifecycle. To determine the support lifecycle for your product and version, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Vulnerability in the Windows Schannel Security Package - CVE-2007-2218

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows Schannel on a client machine validates server-sent digital signatures. An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through an Internet Web browser and then convince a user to view the Web site. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-2218](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2007-2218)

#### Mitigating Factors for Vulnerability in the Windows Schannel Security Package - CVE-2007-2218

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* Attempts to exploit this vulnerability will most probably result in a Denial of Service condition caused by an unexpected restart of the affected system rather than Remote Code Execution. On Windows 2000, the denial of service condition is limited to existing and new SSL and TLS connections whereas the system would still be available otherwise. On Windows Server 2003, a successful attack would cause the system to restart.

#### Workarounds for Vulnerability in the Windows Schannel Security Package - CVE-2007-2218

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for Vulnerability in the Windows Schannel Security Package - CVE-2007-2218

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

On Windows XP, this is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Attempts to exploit this vulnerability will most probably result in a denial of service condition rather than remote code execution.

On Windows 2000 this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop accepting SSL and TLS connections. The system would not be able to connect to Web sites or resources using SSL or TLS until a restart of the system.

On Windows 2003, the vulnerability could cause the affected system to automatically restart.

This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly on Windows 2000 and Windows 2003.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Schannel performs insufficient checks for specially crafted server-sent digital signatures during the SSL handshake.

**What is Schannel?**

The Secure Channel (Schannel) security package is a Security Support Provider (SSP) that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) Internet standard authentication protocols. Schannel is part of the security package that provides an authentication service to provide secure communications between client and server. For more information about Schannel, visit the following [MSDN Web site.](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/ms678421.aspx)

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system on Windows XP editions. However, attempts to exploit this vulnerability would most likely result in an Internet Web browser or application using SSL/TLS to exit. The system would not be able to connect to Web sites or resources using SSL or TLS until a restart of the system. On Windows 2000 editions and Windows 2003 editions attempts to exploit this vulnerability would result in a denial of service condition.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through an Internet Web browser and then convince a user to view the Web site. The processing of this specially crafted server-sent digital signature causes any application that uses this API to exit, and also disables the SSL protocol until the next system restart. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where an Internet Web browser or applications that use SSL or TLS is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that the client parses server-key exchange data sent from the server.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies any applicable RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the Package Installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

## Microsoft Windows Secure Channel integer underflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#810073

Original Release Date: 2007-06-14 | Last Revised: 2007-06-14

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in Microsoft Windows Secure Channel security package may lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows Secure Channel ([Schannel](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms678421.aspx)) security package implements standard network authentication protocols Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). A vulnerability exists in the way Schannel handles specially crafted digital signatures from the server during the SSL handshake, which can result in an integer underflow and heap memory corruption. According to Microsoft Security Bulletin [ms07-031](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-031.mspx):  *Schannel performs insufficient checks for specially crafted server-sent digital signatures during the SSL handshake.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| According to Microsoft Security Bulletin [ms07-031](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-031.mspx) this vulnerability affects different versions of Microsoft Windows differently:  *On Windows XP... An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system.On Windows 2000 this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop accepting SSL and TLS connections. On Windows 2003, the vulnerability could cause the affected system to automatically restart.*See Microsoft Security Bulletin [ms07-031](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-031.mspx) for more detailed information. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [ms07-031](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-031.mspx) for more details. |
| --- |

| **Do not follow unsolicited links**In order to convince users to visit their sites, attackers often use URL encoding, IP address variations, long URLs, intentional misspellings, and other techniques to create misleading links. Do not click on unsolicited links received in email, instant messages, web forums, or internet relay chat (IRC) channels. Type URLs directly into the browser to avoid these misleading links. While these are generally good security practices, following these behaviors will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all cases, particularly if a trusted site has been compromised or allows cross-site scripting. |
