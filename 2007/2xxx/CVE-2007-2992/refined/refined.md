Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2007-2992:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Input passed to fields in OmegaMw7's tables is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Arbitrary HTML and script code can be injected into a user's browser session.
- **SQL Injection:**  SQL commands can be injected.
- The vulnerability exists in many standard fields in different tables (e.g. F05003, F05005, F05015) and all user-created text fields using the form creator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable both locally and remotely.
- The attacker injects malicious code/commands via various input fields.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit input to vulnerable fields in the application.
- The attacker does not necessarily require elevated privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in OmegaMw7 software.
- The report was published by MC Iglo.
- The content indicates a medium risk severity.
- The description indicates a large number of vulnerable fields, potentially making exploitation widespread.
- The vulnerability can be exploited through standard and user-created fields.
