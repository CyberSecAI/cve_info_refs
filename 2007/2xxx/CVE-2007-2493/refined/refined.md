{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to an insecure implementation in `faq.php` that allows for remote file inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file, allowing them to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted GET request to `faq.php` with the `module_root_path` parameter set to a malicious URL containing PHP code.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and the ability to host a malicious PHP file. They need to know the vulnerable path for faq.php file. The attacker must also be able to execute commands in the server."
