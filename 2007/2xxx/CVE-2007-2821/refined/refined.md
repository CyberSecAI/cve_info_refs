Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2821

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` file of WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input passed through the cookie parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The provided exploit uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique to extract data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database.
*   **Data Extraction:** As demonstrated by the provided exploit, an attacker can extract sensitive data such as user passwords hashes.
*   **Potential for full system compromise:** Depending on the database permissions, a successful SQL injection could lead to complete compromise of the server hosting the wordpress installation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The malicious SQL injection is embedded within the `cookie` parameter of the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** Requires some knowledge about the target wordpress install, including the table prefix used in the database.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTTP request with the SQL injection.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit uses `BENCHMARK` to introduce a time delay in the SQL query execution. This delay is then used to determine the correctness of the injected SQL condition, enabling character-by-character extraction of the password hash (a blind SQL injection technique).
*   The exploit code is written in PHP and uses `curl` to perform the HTTP requests.

**Summary:**

CVE-2007-2821 is a SQL injection vulnerability in WordPress's `admin-ajax.php` that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands by manipulating the cookie parameter. Successful exploitation can lead to sensitive data disclosure, and potentially full system compromise.
