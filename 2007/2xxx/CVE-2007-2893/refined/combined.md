| [Description](#c0)  Matt Fleming (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-08-08 19:10:26 UTC  ``` Tavis Ormandy discovered two issues that affect bochs <= 2.3  The first issue is caused by a heap overflow error in the emulated NE2000 device that allows a large value in the TXCNT register to exceed the available memory, which could be exploited by an attacker with "root" privileges on a vulnerable guest system to execute arbitrary code on the host system.  The second vulnerability is caused by a divide-by-zero in the emulated floppy disk controller, which could be exploited by malicious users to terminate the bochs process, creating a denial of service condition.  <http://www.frsirt.com/english/advisories/2007/1936> ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Matt Fleming (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-08-08 19:16:38 UTC  ``` CC'ing maintainer and setting whiteboard status. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-08-14 10:45:47 UTC  ``` Debian seems to have fixed this with DSA 1351-1. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belon    2007-09-03 21:30:26 UTC  ``` fedora also published a fix which links to the following already closed (in cvs) upstream bug report :  <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=112580&aid=1729822&group_id=12580>  fedora's CVS contains patches for both bugs that apply to 2.3 in :  <http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewcvs/devel/bochs/> ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belon    2007-09-03 22:29:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 129950](attachment.cgi?id=129950 "fix for CVE-2007-2893 from CVS") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=129950&action=edit "fix for CVE-2007-2893 from CVS"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=129950&action=diff "fix for CVE-2007-2893 from CVS")] fix for CVE-2007-2893 from CVS  reconstructed from CVS with information from fedora package.  tested in bochs-2.3 for amd64 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belon    2007-09-03 22:30:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 129952](attachment.cgi?id=129952 "fix for CVE-2007-2894 from CVS") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=129952&action=edit "fix for CVE-2007-2894 from CVS"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=129952&action=diff "fix for CVE-2007-2894 from CVS")] fix for CVE-2007-2894 from CVS  reconstructed from CVS with information from fedora package.  tested in bochs-2.3 for amd64 ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-08 15:32:57 UTC  ``` lu_zero please advise. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Luca Barbato   gentoo-dev  2007-09-09 00:10:24 UTC  ``` bochs-2.3 doesn't build for me and I'm tempted to remove it since qemu covers the needs in a simpler and faster way.

# Bochs: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-21**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Bochs, possibly allowing
for the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/bochs** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.3** |

### Background

Bochs is a IA-32 (x86) PC emulator written in C++.

### Description

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered a heap-based
overflow vulnerability in the NE2000 driver (CVE-2007-2893). He also
discovered a divide-by-zero error in the emulated floppy disk
controller (CVE-2007-2894).

### Impact

A local attacker in the guest operating system could exploit these
issues to execute code outside of the virtual machine, or cause Bochs
to crash.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Bochs users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/bochs-2.3"
```

Package        : bochs
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-2893

Tavis Ormandy discovered that bochs, a highly portable IA-32 PC emulator,
is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the emulated NE2000 network device
driver, which may lead to privilege escalation.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.1+20041109-3sarge1.

For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3-2etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3+20070705-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your bochs packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
