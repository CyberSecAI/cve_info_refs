Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how WikkaWiki's RSS feed for recent changes handled private pages. Initially, it was believed that the vulnerability exposed the content of private pages. However, the vendor clarified that prior to WikkaWiki 1.1.6.3, the recent changes feed only revealed the *name*, optional revision note, and revision date of private pages, but not the actual content itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the RSS feed for recent changes was not properly restricted, allowing unauthorized users to see the *names* of private pages, as well as potentially the revision notes and revision dates. This exposed information about the existence and modifications of private pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to information disclosure, where an attacker can discover the names of private pages, and gain insight into activity on the wiki, even for content that is supposed to be private.  An attacker could use the revealed information to identify sensitive areas of the wiki and potentially target them for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through accessing the RSS feed for recent changes. An attacker could monitor this feed to collect the names of private pages, and potentially revision notes and dates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker only needs to be able to access the publicly available RSS feed, there is no need for authentication to gather this data.
