  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes files based on user-supplied input through the 'base' parameter without proper sanitization, leading to Remote File Inclusion.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to either `vbgsitemap-config.php` or `vbgsitemap-vbseo.php` with a malicious URL in the 'base' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and control a server that hosts the malicious payload."
