The provided content relates to CVE-2007-2006.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The pl-PHP Beta 0.9 application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to a lack of proper input sanitization and insecure coding practices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** The `login.php` script does not sanitize the `$login` and `$pass` variables before using them in an SQL query.
2.  **Global Variable Manipulation:** The `admin.php` script directly uses the `is_admin` variable from the GET request without proper validation.
3.  **Local File Inclusion:** The `admin.php` script includes files based on the `$lang` variable from the GET request without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** Allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain admin access by injecting SQL code into the login form.
2.  **Global Variable Manipulation:** Allows an attacker to gain admin access by directly setting the `is_admin` variable to 1 in the URL.
3.  **Local File Inclusion:** Allows an attacker to include arbitrary local files by manipulating the `lang` variable in the URL, potentially leading to information disclosure or further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** Sending a specially crafted `login` value in the login form on `login.php`.
2.  **Global Variable Manipulation:** Directly accessing `admin.php` with `is_admin=1` in the URL.
3.  **Local File Inclusion:** Directly accessing `admin.php` with a manipulated `lang` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special access is required, as all vulnerabilities are accessible remotely.
