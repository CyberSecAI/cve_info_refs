  The oracle.exe process and thread objects on Windows have not been secured
properly and have NULL DACLs - this means that *anyone* (as part of the
Everyone special group) that has local access to the server or (remote access
and the ability to run code) can exploit this to gain local system/admin
privileges. (OpenThread() -> SetThreadContext() -> Set EIP to shellcode)
  Regardless of the operating system, though, (unless your running a well
configured CMW/B1 system like Virtual Vault or Pitbull) there's not much you
can do to stop a hacker that has root or administrator/local system privileges.
  Without even going through the database server an attacker with this level of
privilege can go straight after the datafiles.
  Encryption of data is the best solution - of course you'll need to ensure
that the attacker doesn't have access to the keys, though!
  For more information on Oracle and database security see

  Cheers,
David Litchfield
p.s. The NULL Dacl problems are not Microsoft's fault before anyone blames
them...

Practical 10 Minutes Security Audit
Oracle Case

Cesar Cerrudo

Overview

●  Introduction

●  The technique
●  Finding 0days in Oracle
●  Getting technical
●  Owning Oracle
●  Conclusions
●  References

Introduction

• Sometimes  it's  needed  a  way  to  infer  how
is  before

trustable  and  secure  a  software
purchasing and/or deploying

• A full auditing takes a lot of time and resources

• A quick and very easy audit technique can help
– It can be done by non very technically skilled people

– It reduces auditing time and costs

– Many of these kind of techniques can be combined for

better results

– If you can find issues in a couple of minutes then you

can be almost sure that the software is not very secure

The technique

• This  technique

is

for  easily  and  quickly

auditing Windows applications

• It  is  as  simple  as  looking  at  process  objects

identifying weak permissions

– Weak permissions allow object manipulation by

unprivileged users

• Changing permissions on objects can crash the

process

• Depending on the object type sometimes is even

possible to get arbitrary code execution as it will be
demonstrated later

The technique

• The following tools are needed:

– Process Explorer

– WinObj

– Pipeacl Tools

• Install and run the software to be audited

• Identify software processes

– Mostly we should care about privileged process like

services

– Regular processes should be audited if the application

will be used in a shared environment such as
Terminal Services, Citrix, etc.

– Demo

The technique

• Start looking at process objects permissions

– Look at named objects created by the process that

can be opened from other processes such as
events, mutexes, semaphores, sections, pipes,
threads, etc.

– Demo

• Identify weak permissions

– Look for low privileged accounts with “Change

Permissions” or “Write DACL” permissions

– If no groups or user accounts are listed then the

object was created with a null DACL

• Then all users have full control over the object

– Demo

The technique

• Change permissions on objects found and

interact with the audited application
– Process Explorer doesn't let to edit permissions on

some objects

• WinObj and Pipeacl tools can help

– Look if the application crash or stop responding

Findings 0days in Oracle

• Let's see the technique in action

• Let's audit Oracle 10g R2
– Extremely secure software

– In house audited with next generation tools

– The proud of Oracle security engineering

– Hard challenge for finding vulnerabilities

– It makes Windows unbreakable

• Demo

Getting technical

• Objects  weak  permissions  problem

is  because

improper use of SetSecurityDescriptorDacl() function
– If third function parameter (pDacl) is set as NULL a
NULL DACL is assigned to the security descriptor
and no protection is assigned to the object

– Documented on MSDN

• It seems some Oracle people is allergic to read

Microsoft related stuff

– Identifying bad usage of

SetSecurityDescriptorDacl() function is a 5 minutes
IDA job

• Demo

Getting technical

• Oracle has always nice surprises for us
– SetKernelObjectSecurity() is being used for

changing the DACL on the process

– Looking at process permissions we can see

Everyone group has PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE rights

– Why would someone do that?

• Maybe it's on Oracle superior secure coding guides

• Very bad design and coding

– Let's see now how to exploit it

Owning Oracle

• With    PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE  rights,  how  can

we get arbitrary code execution?

– We can duplicate data files handles and read all the

data but we want arbitrary code execution

– We can duplicate impersonation tokens but low

privileged users can't impersonate :(

– What about duplicating a thread and changing

context to execute our code?

• We only need a way to put our code at known location

• We can put the code in the shared section we

previously saw (remember it has full permissions for
Everyone)

– Demo

Conclusions

• Very easy and quick technique

• Just making click on proper tools you can

quickly identify these vulnerabilities

• If you like to work at low level, using IDA
to identify these vulnerabilities is even
faster

• Most of these vulnerabilities can be

exploited to just cause a DoS but in some
cases they can be exploited to run
arbitrary code

Conclusions

• Total spent time: 10 minutes

• Skills needed: none

• Number of vulnerabilities found:  5 or more

• Oracle database versions affected: ALL

• PoC exploit code provided: YES

• Money invested: $ 0.00
• Having fun with Oracle software and pointing out

Oracle security excellence: priceless

Oracle continues showing that it's

 extremely hard to break!

Additional information will be added soon.    With this CPU Oracle has fixed 36 security bugs in various Oracle products and components. The oldest bug which is fixed in this CPU is from 2003. It is necessary to apply this CPU on every Oracle Client installation to avoid the DB11.  The Oracle database patches are fixing 13 security bugs. The most critical security bug for Windows databases is DB01 which allows remote exploitation without usercredentials. The CVSS rating for this bug is 7.0. For Unix and Windows users one critical bug (DB05) is related to the database logon trigger mechanism. It's possible to bypass database logon trigger if the CPU April 2007 is not applied.   Keep in mind that there are no patches for Oracle XE for Windows. The remote exploitable bug (DB01) is and will be unfixed in XE (like many other critical issues). Oracle is not planning to release patches for XE.   Oracle fixes also 2 new security problems in the Oracle Enterprise Manager, 1 in Oracle Workflow Cartridge and 1 in the Ultrasearch.
