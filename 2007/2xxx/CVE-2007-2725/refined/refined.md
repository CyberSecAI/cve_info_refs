- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `SaveToFile` method of the `DEWizardAX.ocx` ActiveX control allows arbitrary file overwrites.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file overwrite vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite the content of arbitrary files with random data. This can lead to system compromise by modifying critical system files (e.g., `system.ini`).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by calling the vulnerable `SaveToFile` method of the ActiveX control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute the ActiveX control, typically through a web browser. The attacker would also need to craft specific input for the `SaveToFile` method to trigger the arbitrary file overwrite.
