Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in phpMyNewsletter 0.8 (beta5) related to CVE-2007-2372:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The provided exploit script targets two distinct vulnerabilities within phpMyNewsletter 0.8 (beta5):

1.  **Configuration File Modification:** The vulnerability lies in the `admin/index.php` file, specifically the function that saves global configurations. The script notes that while a login check exists, the code modifying the configuration file appears earlier in the execution flow (line 33) than the login check (line 79). This allows an attacker to bypass authentication and overwrite config values. The exploit assumes `mq=off` allowing for shell injection.
2.  **Newsletter Sending:** The `admin/send_mod.php` script does not properly protect against unauthorized newsletter sending. The script states that the admin access check is inadequate. This allows an attacker to create and send newsletters to all subscribers. Additionally, a function to add new newsletters is also present in the same file enabling a "perfect spam sender program".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass/Config Modification:** Lack of proper authentication before config file modification allowing config values to be overwritten.
2.  **Insufficient Access Control:** Lack of adequate access control in `send_mod.php`, allowing unauthorized newsletter creation and sending.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Config Modification:** An attacker can overwrite database configuration values rendering the application unusable and possibly injecting malicious code.
2.  **Newsletter Spam:** An attacker can send mass emails to all subscribers, potentially for phishing or other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** Both vulnerabilities are exploited via crafted HTTP POST requests to specific `admin` files (`index.php` and `send_mod.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable phpMyNewsletter application.
*   **Knowledge of Target Path:** The attacker needs to know or guess the path where the phpMyNewsletter application is installed on the server.
*  **No Authentication Required:** The exploit bypasses authentication for configuration manipulation.
*   **HTTP Request Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to send specifically crafted HTTP POST requests with the proper parameters.
