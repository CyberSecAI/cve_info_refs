Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2007-2522:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `inoweb` service of Computer Associates eTrust AntiVirus Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `inoweb` service, which listens on TCP port 12168, has an authentication function.
- This function copies username and password parameters into fixed-length stack buffers without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.
- The vulnerability can also lead to a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker sends a malformed packet to the vulnerable service on TCP port 12168.
- The malformed packet contains overly long username and/or password parameters which causes a buffer overflow when they are copied into fixed size stack buffers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to the target system on TCP port 12168.
- No prior authentication is required, and the attacker can be unauthenticated.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Tenable Network Security and reported by the Zero Day Initiative.
- Computer Associates released an update to fix the vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a specific filter.
