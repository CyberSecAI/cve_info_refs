Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Mambo Module Calendar (Agenda) version 1.5.5 and earlier is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The vulnerability exists because the `absolute_path` parameter in `com_calendar.php` and `mod_calendar.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include remote files.

* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application directly includes the file specified by the `absolute_path` parameter without proper validation.

* **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote server. This could allow them to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server running Mambo, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

* **Attack vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a URL that passes a malicious URL to the `absolute_path` parameter in the following files:
        *   `/components/calendar/com_calendar.php`
        *   `/modules/calendar/mod_calendar.php`
        *   `/components/com_calendar.php`
        *   `/modules/mod_calendar.php`

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Mambo application. They do not need to be authenticated.
