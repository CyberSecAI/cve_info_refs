**CVE Description:** The provided information does not include an official CVE description. However, the extracted content clearly identifies the vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `showpic.php` script of Wabbit PHP Gallery v0.9.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the HTML output. This is specifically triggered via the `pic` and `gal` parameters in the `showpic.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to `showpic.php` with the malicious javascript payload injected in either the `pic` or `gal` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs containing the malicious payload and induce a victim to access the URL. This does not require any special privileges or position on the network.
