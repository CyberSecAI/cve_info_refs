Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-2929:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the IBM and Lenovo Access Support `acpRunner` ActiveX control failing to properly restrict access to its methods. Specifically, the control doesn't validate the web domains that can use its functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Domain Restriction:** The `acpRunner` ActiveX control allows any website to call its methods, including those that download, extract, and run software from a remote server. This lack of access control is the core issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting this flaw, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. The code will run with the same privileges as the user currently logged in.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The attacker can perform this remotely by enticing a user to view a malicious HTML document or website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted HTML:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML document (e.g., a web page, email, or HTML attachment) that uses the vulnerable ActiveX control and its methods to download and run malicious software.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to view the malicious HTML document. This could be through social engineering techniques like sending phishing emails with malicious attachments, or luring users to compromised websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote from the victim's system.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need to authenticate to the system.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to persuade the user to open/view the malicious HTML content.

**Additional Notes (from the provided documents):**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in Automated Solutions fix pack 1, which removes the vulnerable control and provides an updated version with proper domain restrictions.
*   Microsoft also addressed this vulnerability by setting the kill bit for the affected ActiveX control in MS07-045
*   The vulnerable ActiveX control has the CLSID: `{E598AC61-4C6F-4F4D-877F-FAC49CA91FA3}`
*  The vulnerability was reported by Will Dormann of CERT/CC.
