Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-2808:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `database` parameter in the `gnatsweb.pl` CGI script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.
- The injected code executes within the user's browser session, in the context of the affected website. This can lead to various malicious activities including, but not limited to:
   - Data theft (cookies, session tokens)
   - User impersonation
   - Website defacement
   - Redirection to malicious sites
   - Other client-side attacks

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `database` parameter in the `gnatsweb.pl` CGI script.
- This parameter is vulnerable to XSS due to the lack of sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `database` parameter in a request to the vulnerable `gnatsweb.pl` script.
- This could be achieved by crafting a malicious URL, or other methods of influencing the input to the application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by "r0t".
- The affected versions are Gnatsweb v4.00 and Gnats v4.1.99.
- A fix involves editing the source code to properly sanitize the input.
