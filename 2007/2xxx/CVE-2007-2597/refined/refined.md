Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2007-2597:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `tt_docroot` parameter within various PHP files of the telltarget CMS. This allows an attacker to include remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. The application directly includes code from a URL supplied by the attacker through the `tt_docroot` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify existing data, or create backdoors for future access.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By including malicious code, an attacker could also cause the server to become unstable or unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed through HTTP GET requests by manipulating the `tt_docroot` parameter in the URL.
- **Targeted Files:** The vulnerability is present in multiple PHP files within the `phplib` directory of the telltarget CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know about the `tt_docroot` parameter and how it's used in the application.
- **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker needs to have access to a location where the malicious file can be hosted and made accessible via HTTP.
