  "content": [
    {
      "type": "exploit_db",
      "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the 'newsnr' parameter of the 'print.php' script before using it in a SQL query.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "SQL Injection"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the retrieval of sensitive information such as admin usernames and password hashes.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "HTTP GET request to 'print.php' with a crafted 'newsnr' parameter"
        ],
         "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. Magic quotes must be off."
      },
      "technical_details": "The vulnerable code is located in the `print.php` file, where the `$newsnr` variable is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization. The exploit uses a crafted `newsnr` value containing a SQL UNION statement to extract user credentials from the database. The payload used is `newsnr=-999 UNION SELECT 0,0,0,password,username,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 FROM simpnews_users WHERE usernr=1`"
