```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The com_mosmedia component for Mambo & Joomla is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability lies in the `media.tab.php` and `media.divs.php` files, which are susceptible to remote file inclusion via the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can include arbitrary files from a remote server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the target server.
- Attack vectors: The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP files within the component, specifically `media.tab.php` and `media.divs.php`.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server, and have access to a malicious file on a server they control.
