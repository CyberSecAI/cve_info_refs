    "ID": "CVE-2007-2482",
    "content": "The wordpress plugin wordTube version 1.43 and earlier is vulnerable to remote file inclusion. The 'wpPATH' parameter in wordtube-button.php is not properly sanitized before being used in `require_once` calls. This allows an attacker to include arbitrary files from local or external resources.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper sanitization of the `wpPATH` parameter before using it in a `require_once` statement.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Remote File Inclusion"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file, potentially leading to system access.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP request to `wordtube-button.php` with a malicious URL in the `wpPATH` parameter.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable script and know the location of the vulnerable file. Additionally, `register_globals` must be enabled on the server for successful exploitation."
