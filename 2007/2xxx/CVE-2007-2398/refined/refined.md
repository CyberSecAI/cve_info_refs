**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   A timing issue in Safari 3.1 allowed a web page to manipulate the address bar contents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Timing Issue:** The core issue was a race condition where a web page could alter the displayed URL in the address bar before the browser loaded the actual content of the new page.
*   **Address Bar Spoofing:** This allowed a malicious web page to display a different URL than the one being loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could use this to spoof legitimate websites and trick users into providing credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **User Deception:** Users could be misled into believing they are on a trusted site, even when they are not.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker would host a specially crafted web page that exploits the timing issue.
*   **User Interaction:** Users would need to be tricked into visiting the malicious web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Web Server Access:** Attackers need to host the malicious website.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers would likely need to use social engineering techniques to lure users to the malicious site.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was initially addressed in Safari Beta 3.0.2 but was reintroduced in Safari 3.1.
*   The fix involves restoring the address bar contents if a request for a new page is terminated.
*   This issue only affected Windows XP and Vista versions of Safari and did not impact Mac OS X systems.
