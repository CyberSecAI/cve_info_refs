RELATED: CVE-2007-2244
Root cause of vulnerability:
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Adobe products that can be triggered while processing a malformed BMP, DIB, or RLE file.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
- Buffer overflow: The application does not properly validate the size of the data read from a crafted BMP, DIB or RLE file leading to an overflow.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary code execution: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system with the privileges of the user running the affected application.

Attack vectors:
- Malicious BMP, DIB or RLE file: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by enticing a user to open a malicious BMP, DIB, or RLE file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- User interaction: The attacker needs to have a user open the malicious file with the vulnerable application.
