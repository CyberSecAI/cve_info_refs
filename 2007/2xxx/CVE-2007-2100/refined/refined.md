Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a direct database disclosure within the FAC Guestbook v2.0 software. The Microsoft Access database file (.mdb) containing sensitive data is directly accessible via a web request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The primary weakness is the lack of access control for the database file. The application does not prevent direct access to the `Gdb.mdb` file, making it downloadable by anyone who knows its path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Confidentiality Impact:**  The attacker can download the database, exposing all information it contains. This includes potentially sensitive data about the guestbook users, their messages, and potentially administrative credentials if stored within the database.
*    **Complete Integrity Impact**: If the attacker is able to modify the database, they can change the data as they see fit. This can result in the deletion of data, the modification of user information, or the injection of malicious content.
*    **Complete Availability Impact**: If the attacker is able to modify or corrupt the database, they can make the guestbook application unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attack vector is purely remote. An attacker can access the database simply by knowing the path to the file via a web request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of File Path:** The attacker needs to know the correct file path to the `Gdb.mdb` file to directly download it. The provided example is `www.example.com/[path]/db/Gdb.mdb`

**Summary**

This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to download the entire database of FAC GuestBook v2.0 by directly accessing it through the web. This leads to complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability. The CVSS base score of 10/10 accurately reflects the severity of this issue.
