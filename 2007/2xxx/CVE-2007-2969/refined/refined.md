Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `newsletter.php` script in wanewsletter 2.1.3 is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). It improperly uses the `waroot` parameter in the `require_once()` function, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization or validation of user-supplied input (`waroot` parameter) used in `require_once()`.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By including a malicious file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This can lead to data theft, defacement, or further attacks on other systems.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `newsletter.php`, supplying the URL of the malicious remote file via the `waroot` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They must also host or have access to a malicious PHP file that can be included.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit utilizes the following request:
```
[Path]/newsletter/newsletter.php?waroot=shell
```
Where `[Path]` is the path to the vulnerable installation and `shell` is the URL to a malicious file. The `waroot` parameter is directly used in a `require_once()` function call, causing the inclusion of the attacker controlled file which contains malicious code.
