{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the insecure inclusion of a file specified via the `cfg_file` parameter in the `autoindex.php` script. The script directly includes the file specified in this parameter without proper sanitization or validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The application doesn't validate the input provided via the `cfg_file` parameter, allowing arbitrary file inclusion.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a malicious file from a remote location and execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete compromise of the web application and potentially the server itself.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to `autoindex.php` with a malicious URL in the `cfg_file` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and host a malicious file on a publicly accessible location."
