| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=422881#c0)  Tom Sightler    2007-12-13 04:34:20 UTC  ``` Description of problem: We have been using the mirror feature of lftp with RHEL3 and RHEL4 for years  without issues, however, since upgrading the RHEL5 all of our mirror scripts  started hanging.  This appears to be a known issue with the -c option in the  version of lftp currently included with RHEL5 (3.5.1) and was fixed in the next  release (3.5.2).  I'm requesting that lftp either be upgraded to a more recent 3.5.x release, or  at least backport the -c fixes from 3.5.2 so that the mirror function becomes  usable again.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): lftp-3.6.1-1.el5.rf  How reproducible: Pretty much alwasy when using the -c option with mirror or get.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Use lftp -c mirror or -c get and watch process hang. 2. 3.    Actual results: lftp hangs and never completes.  Expected results: lftp should get the files as requested  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=422881#c2)  RHEL Program Management    2008-06-04 22:47:15 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux maintenance release.  Product Management has requested further review of this request by Red Hat Engineering, for potential inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Update release for currently deployed products.  This request is not yet committed for inclusion in an Update release.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=422881#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2009-09-02 09:38:01 UTC  ``` An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on therefore solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below. You may reopen this bug report if the solution does not work for you.  <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-1278.html>   ``` |  |

Impact: A user could be provided a lftp script by a malicious person that could execute arbitary shell script.  vulnerability is very a bit unlikely to exploit imho.  net-ftp/lftp-3.5.9 and 3.5.10 in the tree lftp-3.5.10 fixes a few core dumps and has some library linking foo added. Recommend stabilizing this version.  I checked the code and the vulnerability existed in latest stable version (3.4.6).  Test plan for 3.5.10 - its a ftp client  - treat it like one. lftp is a basic ftp client. To test try the following: $ lftp ftp://lftp.yar.ru/lftp/old cd ok, cwd=/lftp/old lftp lftp.yar.ru:/lftp/old> ls ... lftp lftp.yar.ru:/lftp/old> get lftp-3.4.5.tar.bz2.asc ... lftp lftp.yar.ru:/lftp/old> mget lftp-*.md5sum ... lftp lftp.yar.ru:/lftp/old> bye $ ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-04-11 11:00:05 UTC  ``` Thx Daniel.

Depending on the command given this could allow a remote shell in where there wasn't before. so i'm saying go glsa=yes. ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Matt Drew (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-02 12:56:08 UTC  ``` This is either a non-issue or it hasn't been fixed, since you can already drop to a shell from the lftp script (append a line starting with ! and then your shell commands, confirmed on 3.5.10).  There's essentially no difference between running an untrusted lftp script and running an untrusted bash script.  Even without the shell commands, it would be pretty trivial for an untrusted lftp script to do things like overwrite local files (cron, .bash_profile, etc) to gain code execution as the user.  There's not really any way around this that I see. ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Matt Drew (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-03 11:29:50 UTC  ``` I vote no, by the way. :) ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-03 18:47:51 UTC  ``` /vote NO.  ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-05-03 18:55:13 UTC  ``` Two NO votes -> closing with NO GLSA. Feel free to reopen if you disagree. ``` |  |

# Welcome to the Gentoo wiki!

Larry the Cow beckons you to explore the Gentoo wiki!

## Available documentation

To find information use the search box on the top right corner of the screen, or categorically browse the wiki using the [Documentation topic](#Documentation_topics) links provided below.

Both official Gentoo project documentation as well as community-contributed content can be found here. The vast majority of documentation is publicly editable. Official documents have a *Handbook:* or *Project:* prefix (only developers can edit them). Community members can leave comments/feedback for these pages via their respective *Discussion* pages.

Find something to add or edit? The [*Getting started*](#Getting_started) section (below) gives contributors a few pointers on how to start editing articles.

Most importantly, the **Gentoo Handbook** is among the best documents found on the wiki:

 [Gentoo Handbook (Official installation documentation)](/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page "Handbook:Main Page")

 **Important**
Due to usability issues the [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVisualEditor "wikipedia:Wikipedia:VisualEditor") has been temporarily disabled. See [bug #910279](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=910279) for more details.
#### January 1, 2025: Happy New Year!

Thanks for making 2024 great, and here's to an even *greater* New Year! 2025 should be a 'big' year for the wiki!

During Q1 2025, we have plans to update the software stack which supports the wiki. Before and during the update, we'll do our best to provide any additional details if and as they are needed by adding context details to [infra-status.g.o](https://infra-status.gentoo.org/). As with any infrastructure update, expect a lack of availability during the update window and possibly even after if things go awry. We'll at least be locking the wiki into a read-only state; but we plan also for the wiki to be offline for a certain amount of time during the update. Post successful update, we plan to do better at implementing scheduled maintenance routinely within planned windows which will hopefully enable a shorter down time between updates.

 To all in our amazing community, thank YOU for making the Gentoo wiki the best FOSS wiki on the web!

## Topic

An updated lftp package that fixes one security issue and various bugs is
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having low security impact by the Red Hat
Security Response Team.

## Description

LFTP is a sophisticated file transfer program for the FTP and HTTP
protocols. Like bash, it has job control and uses the readline library for
input. It has bookmarks, built-in mirroring, and can transfer several files
in parallel. It is designed with reliability in mind.

It was discovered that lftp did not properly escape shell metacharacters
when generating shell scripts using the "mirror --script" command. A
mirroring script generated to download files from a malicious FTP server
could allow an attacker controlling the FTP server to run an arbitrary
command as the user running lftp. (CVE-2007-2348)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* when using the "mirror" or "get" commands with the "-c" option, lftp did

not check for some specific conditions that could result in the program
becoming unresponsive, hanging and the command not completing. For example,
when waiting for a directory listing, if lftp received a "226" message,
denoting an empty directory, it previously ignored the message and kept
waiting. With this update, these conditions are properly checked for and
lftp no longer hangs when "-c" is used with "mirror" or "get". (BZ#422881)

* when using the "put", "mput" or "reput" commands over a Secure FTP (SFTP)

connection, specifying the "-c" option sometimes resulted in corrupted
files of incorrect size. With this update, using these commands over SFTP
with the "-c" option works as expected, and transferred files are no
longer corrupted in the transfer process. (BZ#434294)

* previously, LFTP linked to the OpenSSL library. OpenSSL's license is,

however, incompatible with LFTP's GNU GPL license and LFTP does not include
an exception allowing OpenSSL linking. With this update, LFTP links to the
GnuTLS (GNU Transport Layer Security) library, which is released under the
GNU LGPL license. Like OpenSSL, GnuTLS implements the SSL and TLS
protocols, so functionality has not changed. (BZ#458777)

* running "help mirror" from within lftp only presented a sub-set of the

available options compared to the full list presented in the man page. With
this update, running "help mirror" in lftp presents the same list of mirror
options as is available in the Commands section of the lftp man page.
(BZ#461922)

* LFTP imports gnu-lib from upstream. Subsequent to gnu-lib switching from

GNU GPLv2 to GNU GPLv3, the LFTP license was internally inconsistent, with
LFTP licensed as GNU GPLv2 but portions of the package apparently licensed
as GNU GPLv3 because of changes made by the gnu-lib import. With this
update, LFTP itself switches to GNU GPLv3, resolving the inconsistency.
(BZ#468858)

* when the "ls" command was used within lftp to present a directory listing

on a remote system connected to via HTTP, file names containing spaces were
presented incorrectly. This update corrects this behavior. (BZ#504591)

* the default alias "edit" did not define a default editor. If EDITOR was

not set in advance by the system, lftp attempted to execute
"~/.lftp/edit.tmp.$$" (which failed because the file is not set to
executable). The edit alias also did not support tab-completion of file
names and incorrectly interpreted file names containing spaces. The updated
package defines a default editor (vi) in the absence of a system-defined
EDITOR. The edit alias now also supports tab-completion and handles file
names containing spaces correctly for both downloading and uploading.
(BZ#504594)

Note: This update upgrades LFTP from version 3.7.3 to upstream version
3.7.11, which incorporates a number of further bug fixes to those noted
above. For details regarding these fixes, refer to the
"/usr/share/doc/lftp-3.7.11/NEWS" file after installing this update.
(BZ#308721)

All LFTP users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which
resolves these issues.

**What should I download? What do I do with these files?**

[Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)

Please see the [Gentoo Handbook](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook%3AMain_Page)
for the complete installation documentation.
It explains how you can find the right architecture for your machine and which files you need at what stage of the installation process.

In brief, a **stage 3** is a minimal set of Gentoo binaries that can upgrade and expand itself (but not much more, i.e., no kernel
or boot loader). The desktop version already contains additional programs needed in a typical desktop installation. The installation CD can be
used to boot and, well, install Gentoo.

 **QCOW2 disk images**

The disk images are full bootable Gentoo installations in qemu's [QCOW2](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/images.html) disk format.
They require UEFI support for booting. One variant comes with no network services and a password-less root account, the other
with access locked by default but [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) running on boot.

#### Processor compatibility

 **Processor compatibility**

The *lp64d* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *lp64* stages can be used on all 64-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.
Multilib stages include toolchain support for all 64-bit and 32-bit ABI and are based on lp64d. They are mostly useful for development and testing purposes.

The *ilp32d* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors supporting the **double-precision floating point** instruction set.
The *ilp32* stages can be used on all 32-bit RISC-V processors; they require no hardware support for floating point arithmetics.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):          Doesn't Affect: RHEL2.1 no support for --script         Doesn't Affect: RHEL3 ditto         Affects: RHEL4         Affects: RHEL5         Affects: FC5         Affects: FC6  Steps to Reproduce: 1. ln -s '$(touch /tmp/gotya; echo kwak)' malicious 2. serve that file via ftp and attempt to download it with lftp via mirror --script 3. Try to run the resulting script with lftp -f    Actual results:  The downloaded file will point to "kwak", while file /tmp/gotya will be created.
