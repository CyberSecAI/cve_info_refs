Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities related to CVE-2007-2004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause stems from multiple vulnerabilities within the InoutMailingListManager application, including:
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application uses a cookie named 'admin' for admin rights check but does not properly validate it. It does not terminate the script execution after checking for cookie, allowing any user to set this cookie and bypass the check.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application utilizes an old version of FCKEditor, allowing for arbitrary file uploads through the connector.php script. This enables attackers to upload malicious PHP files.
*   **SQL Injection:** Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in the application, for example in the changename.php file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The use of a simple cookie without proper validation allows unauthorized users to gain administrative access.
*   **Remote Command Execution:**  Attackers can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code, leading to remote command execution on the server.
*   **SQL Injection:**  Various SQL injection flaws are present throughout the application, potentially leading to data breaches and further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** Remote command execution allows attackers to gain complete control of the server by uploading a shell.
*   **Data Breach:** SQL injection vulnerabilities can expose sensitive database information, including user credentials and application data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can escalate privileges within the application by exploiting the authentication bypass vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The exploit leverages HTTP POST and GET requests to interact with the vulnerable application.
*   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious PHP script using the vulnerable FCKEditor component and a crafted POST request.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker uses an HTTP request with a crafted cookie to bypass admin authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of the application's path:** The attacker needs to know the path where the application is installed on the server.
*   **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker must have the ability to craft and send HTTP POST/GET requests, often using scripting languages such as PHP or Python.

**Exploit details:**

The provided exploit script automates the following steps:
1. Creates a directory for the exploit (696969)
2. Uploads a "piggy_marty_creator.php" script to the server using the file upload vulnerability in the attachfiles.php, which has the following functionality:
    * Writes a "piggy_marty.php" shell script that will allow remote command execution
	* Includes the config.inc.php and prints various database connection strings and admin user credentials.
3. Executes the creator file to create the piggy_marty.php shell file and retrieve login credentials and database connection information.
4. Removes the creator file to prevent detection.
5. Executes the piggy_marty.php script using the "cmd" query parameter, which allows remote execution of any operating system command.
