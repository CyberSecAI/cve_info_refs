Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-2854

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `account_change.php` script of BtiTracker. Specifically, the `style` and `langue` parameters received via HTTP GET requests are directly used in SQL queries without any prior validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection. The application is susceptible because user-controlled input is directly concatenated into SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to modify their user account details, specifically their `id_level`. By setting `id_level` to 8, a regular user can become an administrator.
*   **Complete Control:** Gaining admin privileges provides an attacker with full control over the application, allowing them to modify settings, access data, and potentially compromise the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to the `account_change.php` page.
*   **Manipulating URL Parameters:** The attacker manipulates the `style` parameter to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **User Account:**  The attacker needs an existing user account on the BtiTracker instance to exploit the vulnerability. However, once exploited, the attacker can become an admin.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** Basic knowledge of SQL is needed to craft the exploit.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code in `account_change.php` is:
```php
if (isset($_GET["style"]))
  @mysql_query("UPDATE users SET style=$style WHERE id=".$CURUSER["uid"]);

if (isset($_GET["langue"]))
  @mysql_query("UPDATE users SET language=$langue WHERE id=".$CURUSER["uid"]);
```

The provided proof of concept (PoC) is:
`account_change.php?style=1,id_level=8`

This exploits the SQL injection by injecting `1,id_level=8` into the `style` field of the `users` table. This sets the `style` to 1 and also sets the `id_level` to 8, granting admin privileges to the user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit is specific to BtiTracker version 1.4.1 and below.
*   The exploit also provides a Google Dork: `"by Btiteam"`. This can be used to identify vulnerable instances of BtiTracker.
*   The `mysql_query` function is deprecated, and the use of such function makes the system vulnerable to SQL injections.
