Researcher: the_3dit0r
Ref: xodagallery Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
     <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/465088/100/0/threaded>

Extracted code is:

  switch ($_GET['cmd']) line 64

Source inspection did not find a vulnerable use of cmd within this
file.  The above switch tests for constant values of $_GET['cmd'].

There are some leading require's, but they seem pretty shallow.

Grep throughout the entire system doesn't produce any "cmd" matches of
interest.

Since a lot of PHP code shells support "cmd", maybe this was tested
against a previously hacked application with a backdoor in it.
Assuming it was tested.
