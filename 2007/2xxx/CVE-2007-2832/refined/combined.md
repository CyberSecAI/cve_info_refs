| CVSS Meta Temp ScoreCVSS is a standardized scoring system to determine possibilities of attacks. The Temp Score considers temporal factors like disclosure, exploit and countermeasures. The unique Meta Score calculates the average score of different sources to provide a normalized scoring system. | Current Exploit Price (≈)Our analysts are monitoring exploit markets and are in contact with vulnerability brokers. The range indicates the observed or calculated exploit price to be seen on exploit markets. A good indicator to understand the monetary effort required for and the popularity of an attack. | CTI Interest ScoreOur Cyber Threat Intelligence team is monitoring different web sites, mailing lists, exploit markets and social media networks. The CTI Interest Score identifies the interest of attackers and the security community for this specific vulnerability in real-time. A high score indicates an elevated risk to be targeted for this vulnerability. |

A vulnerability was found in [Cisco CallManager up to 4.1](?product.cisco:callmanager) ([Unified Communication Software](?type.unified_communication_software)). It has been declared as problematic. Affected by this vulnerability is some unknown functionality of the file */CCMAdmin/serverlist.asp* of the component *Web Interface*. The manipulation of the argument `pattern` with the input value `<img%20src='http://www.scip.ch/scip.gif'%20style='border:%201px%20solid%20black;'>` leads to a cross site scripting vulnerability. The CWE definition for the vulnerability is [CWE-80](?vulnerability_cwe.2977 "Cwe"). The product receives input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special characters such as "<", ">", and "&" that could be interpreted as web-scripting elements when they are sent to a downstream component that processes web pages. As an impact it is known to affect confidentiality, and integrity. The summary by CVE is:
> Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web application firewall in Cisco CallManager before 3.3(5)sr3, 4.1 before 4.1(3)sr5, 4.2 before 4.2(3)sr2, and 4.3 before 4.3(1)sr1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the pattern parameter to CCMAdmin/serverlist.asp (aka the search-form) and possibly other unspecified vectors.

The weakness was disclosed 05/23/2007 by Marc Ruef and Stefan Friedli with scip AG as *Cisco CallManager 4.1 Input Validation Vulnerability* as confirmed advisory (Website). The advisory is shared at [scip.ch](?advisory_url.2977). The public release has been coordinated in cooperation with Cisco. This vulnerability is known as [CVE-2007-2832](?source_cve.2977 "Cve") since 05/23/2007. The attack can be launched remotely. The exploitation doesn't need any form of authentication. It demands that the victim is doing some kind of user interaction. Technical details and also a public exploit are known. MITRE ATT&CK project uses the attack technique [T1059.007](?vulnerability_attck.2977 "Attck") for this issue.

A public exploit has been developed by Marc Ruef/Stefan Friedli in URL/Javascript and been published immediately after the advisory. It is possible to download the exploit at [scip.ch](?exploit_url.2977). It is declared as highly functional. We expect the 0-day to have been worth approximately [$5k-$25k](?kb.exploitprices). By approaching the search of [inurl:CCMAdmin/serverlist.asp](?exploit_googlehack.2977) it is possible to find vulnerable targets with Google Hacking.

Upgrading to version 3.3(5)sr3 eliminates this vulnerability. The upgrade is hosted for download at [cisco.com](?countermeasure_upgrade_url.2977). The advisory contains the following remark:
> A representative of the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) stated, that this kind of exploitation is blocked by improvements to the web application firewall used in CallManager.

The vulnerability is also documented in the databases at X-Force ([34465](?source_xforce.2977 "Xforce")), Exploit-DB ([30077](?source_exploitdb.2977 "Exploitdb")), SecurityFocus (BID 24119†), OSVDB (35337†) and Secunia (SA25377†). The entries [VDB-288958](?id.288958), [VDB-289166](?id.289166), [VDB-289167](?id.289167) and [VDB-289377](?id.289377) are pretty similar.

Cisco CallManager 4.1 Input Validation Vulnerability

scip AG Vulnerability ID 2977 (03/13/2007)
<http://www.scip.ch/cgi-bin/smss/showadvf.pl?id=2977>

I. INTRODUCTION

Cisco CallManager, short CCM, is a professional voice-over-IP solution
that tracks active components, including among others phones, gateways,
conference bridges, transcoding resources and voicemail boxes.

II. DESCRIPTION

Marc Ruef and Stefan Friedli found a web-based vulnerability that was
identified in Cisco CallManager 4.1 and may affect earlier versions as well.

The web interface of the application fails to properly santisize data
supplied by the search-form before displaying it back to the user.
Though several filters are in place to prevent the injection of <script>
Tags or action handlers such as "onclick" or "onmouseover", it is
possible to inject html-code including common attributes. This allows
the embedding of external references, e.g. images or flash resources.
The vulnerability also allows an attacker to use the "style"-attribute
on any tag to conduct arbitrary web-based attacks.

Example:
<https://example.com/CCMAdmin/serverlist.asp?findBy=servername&match=begins&pattern=><img%20src='<http://www.scip.ch/scip.gif>'%20style='border:%201px%20solid%20black;'>

IV. IMPACT

This vulnerability may be exploited by tricking authenticated users into
clicking a crafted link in order to conduct arbitrary web-based attacks.

V. DETECTION

Detection of web based attacks requires a specialized web proxy and/or
intrusion detection system. Patterns for detection of basic attacks are
available and easy to implement, though they may possibly fail on more
sophisticated attacks.

VI. SOLUTION

Server-side input validation should be improved to prevent the injection
of unauthorized code. Cisco has taken appropriate steps regarding this
issue, see vendor response (VII) for details.

VII. VENDOR RESPONSE

A representative of the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team
(PSIRT) stated, that this kind of exploitation is blocked by
improvements to the web application firewall used in CallManager. The
Cisco PSIRT team has issued a formal security response available at:
<http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sr-20070523-ccm.shtml>.
