Just guessing here...

  <http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.strpos.php>

says that strpos "may return Boolean FALSE, but may also return a
non-Boolean value which evaluates to FALSE, such as 0".  The question then
becomes how "===" is handled, and whether it's handled uniformly across
all PHP versions and configs.

BUT...

There's still an issue if you do this:

   http/../../../../etc/passwd

would pass the test and be useful as a directory traversal attack.

(I verified that my PHP 4.4.4 will accept an "up-and-down" traversal with
a non-existent subdirectory.  This usually works in other traversal
scenarios too, not just PHP.)

There's a possibility that $feed is processed elsewhere, but I didn't look
at the code.

readfile() with a URL can also be used for XSS, although people
concentrate so much on RFI that they don't bother pointing this out.

You bring up a very interesting attack angle for attacks against
third-party sites - readfile() as an attack proxy.  I LOVE it!  Wonder if
it's being used in real-world attacks.

PHP, oh PHP, the intricate beauty of your gifts is eternal.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Hmmm, I didn't realize Solaris behaved this way.

I figured it was more of an OS feature; eg, try something like:

   ls foo/../../../../../    (*nix)
   dir foo\..\..\..\..\..\..\   (Windows)

from a directory not too far off root.

Btw, I just tried this on Solaris 10 -- it produced an error rather than
a directory listing.

Someone help me out please... Milw0rm 3800 / Bugtraq 23643 are for a
flaw that looks like a directory traversal; ie,

Exploit:[Path_ext]/examples/layout/feed-proxy.php?feed=../../../../../../etc/passwd

Yet when I look at the code from either version 1.0 alpha 1 (from
<<http://yui-ext.com/deploy/ext-1.0-alpha1.zip>>), which is supposedly
affected, or 1.0 (from <<http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-1.0.zip>>), the
latest version, the affected file has the following code:

   $feed = $_REQUEST['feed'];
   if($feed != '' && strpos($feed, 'http') === 0){
           header('Content-Type: text/xml');
           readfile($feed);
           return;
   }

Now doesn't the strpos() along with the "===" test mean that the feed
parameter must start with "http"??? So did Alkomandoz Hacker bother to
test his/her proof of concept???

Now I suppose if the remote has allow_url_fopen enabled, you might be
able to abuse this to try to hide yourself from attacks against
third-party sites, but that's a separate issue.
