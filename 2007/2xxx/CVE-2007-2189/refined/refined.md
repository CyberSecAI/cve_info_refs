```
Vulnerability: Remote File Inclusion
Module: MX Smartor Album FAP 2.0 RC 1
File: /admin/admin_album_otf.php

* Root cause:
The script `admin_album_otf.php` includes files using a variable `$phpbb_root_path` that is not properly initialized before being used in an `include_once` statement.

* Weakness:
Uncontrolled variable usage in file inclusion.

* Impact:
Arbitrary code execution through remote file inclusion. An attacker can include a remote file containing malicious code, which will then be executed by the server.

* Attack vector:
By manipulating the `phpbb_root_path` GET parameter in the URL.

* Required capabilities:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
