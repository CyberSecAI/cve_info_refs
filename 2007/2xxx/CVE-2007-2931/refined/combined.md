## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**How will this upgrade be distributed?**

Upon signing on to MSN Messenger service, users of MSN Messenger 6.2 and MSN Messenger 7.0 on supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 will be prompted by the client deployment mechanism in the MSN Messenger service to accept the upgrade to MSN Messenger 7.0.0820.

Also, users who desire to download the upgrade to MSN Messenger 7.0.0820 immediately, may do so by using the Download Center link provided in the Affected Software table. Note that this only applies to users of MSN Messenger 6.2 and MSN Messenger 7.0 on supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.

Upon signing on to MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger service, users of MSN Messenger 6.2, MSN Messenger 7.0, MSN Messenger 7.5, and Windows Live Messenger 8.0 on supported editions of platforms later than Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 will be prompted by the client deployment mechanism in the MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger service to accept the upgrade to Windows Live Messenger 8.1.

Also, users who desire to download the upgrade to Windows Live Messenger 8.1 immediately, may do so by using the Download Center link provided in the Affected Software table. Note that this only applies to users of MSN Messenger 6.2, MSN Messenger 7.0, MSN Messenger 7.5, and Windows Live Messenger 8.0 on supported editions of platforms later than Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.

Otherwise, users of vulnerable versions of the MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger clients may not be allowed to connect to the MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger service.

**Why is Microsoft releasing this upgrade over the MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger service as well as providing downloads?**

Microsoft currently issues upgrades for the MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger client using the MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger service because these online services have their own client deployment mechanism. However, Download Center links are also available for specific MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger clients, running on platforms provided in the Affected Software table, because users may desire to download the upgrades immediately.

**If this is an upgrade, how can I detect if I have a vulnerable version of MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger?**

When you attempt to sign on to the MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger service, the client deployment mechanism will automatically determine your current client version and platform and if required, recommend the appropriate upgrade. Also, you may verify your MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger client version by clicking **Help** and then **About**.

**What happens if I do not upgrade to MSN Messenger 7.0.0820 or Windows Live Messenger 8.1?**

If you do not upgrade to a non-affected version of the MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger client, depending on your platform, you will be notified to upgrade on each attempt to sign on. If you do not accept the upgrade, you may not be allowed access to MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger service. See the Non-Affected Software table in this section for details on platforms and upgrade versions of the MSN Messenger and Windows Live Messenger clients.

**Are other Microsoft Real-Time Collaboration applications, like Windows Messenger or Office Communicator, affected by this vulnerability?**

No. Other messaging applications are not affected as they do not contain the vulnerable component.

## MSN Messenger Webcam or Video Chat Session Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2931

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in MSN Messenger 6.2, MSN Messenger 7.0, MSN Messenger 7.5, and Windows Live Messenger 8.0. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution when a user chooses to accept a webcam or video chat invitation from an attacker. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-2931](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-2931).

#### Mitigating Factors for MSN Messenger Webcam or Video Chat Session Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2931

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would have to persuade a user to accept a webcam or video chat invitation in an MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger message. An attacker would have no way to force users to accept the webcam or video chat invitation. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to accept the webcam or video chat invitation.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* Users of Windows Live Messenger 8.1, released in January 2007, are already protected from this vulnerability. Users of MSN Messenger 7.0.0820, recently released, are also already protected from this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for MSN Messenger Webcam or Video Chat Session Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2931

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you perform the upgrade. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* Block MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger traffic by using ISA Server. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 925120](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/925120).

  Impact of workaround. This prevents MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger traffic from entering or leaving your enterprise.
* Block select network ports for MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 927847](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/927847).

  Impact of workaround. This allows administrators to selectively prevent webcam and video chat sessions, as opposed to blocking MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger traffic completely.

#### FAQ for MSN Messenger Webcam or Video Chat Session Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-2931

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists in the way MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger handles specially crafted webcam or video chat sessions. As a result, memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the logged-in user.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could send an invitation to a user to join in a specially crafted webcam or video chat session that is designed to exploit this vulnerability. However, an attacker would have no way to force users to join a webcam or video chat session. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to accept the webcam or video chat invitation.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be signed on to the MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger service and accept a webcam or video chat invitation for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any system where MSN Messenger 6.2, MSN Messenger 7.0, MSN Messenger 7.5, or Windows Live Messenger 8.0 is used, such as workstations or servers, is at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

MSN Messenger 7.0.0820 and Windows Live Messenger 8.1 have been updated to sufficiently manage webcam or video chat sessions.

**I do not use any webcams. Do I still have to upgrade?**

Yes. When you sign on, the MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger service will notify you to upgrade to the appropriate MSN Messenger or Windows Live Messenger client for your platform if you have not done so.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2007-2931.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
