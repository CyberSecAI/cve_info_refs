Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Local Buffer Overflow

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, which can occur when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to potential memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided content does not specify the exact impact, but buffer overflows can potentially lead to:
    - Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can overwrite parts of memory to inject and execute malicious code, potentially gaining full control of the system.
    - Denial of service: Crashing the application or system.
    - Privilege escalation: The attacker can potentially elevate their privileges by corrupting memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker must have local access to the system to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability. No further details on the needed privileges is available.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is associated with "DB11" in the Oracle Critical Patch Update for April 2007.
- This vulnerability is one of several fixed in the April 2007 CPU, with other database-related vulnerabilities including SQL injections and authentication bypasses.
