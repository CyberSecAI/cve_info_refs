\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list md5 sums
or download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- SUN Java 1.5 and 1.6 update
SUN Java 1.5.0 was brought to update14 and SUN Java 1.6.0 was
brought to update4. Details for the security issues fixed are not
yet publicly known, but the changelog lists several issues marked
as security.
The update also contains timezone update 2007k and was released
for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3.
- nss\_ldap incorrect data
nss\_ldap returned incorrect data under certain circumstances to
the calling process. Some applications could therefore work with
wrong user data (CVE-2007-5794).
This has been fixed for all distributions containing nss\_ldap.
- cairo integer overflows in PNG decoder
The cairo libraries were updated to fix several integer overflows
while decoding PNG images. This can be exploited remotely with
user-assistance to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2007-5503)
Updates have been provided for SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, SUSE Linux
10.1, openSUSE 10.2 and 10.3
- geronimo start script problems
A chown in the SUSE supplied Apache geronimo init script could
change ownership of directories it did not own, due to following
symlinks. The default setup would corrupt /var/tmp on start
of geronimo.
While there is potential to exploit this problem,
the administrator will have likely noticed this before already.
- moodle XSS problems
The install script of moodle is vulnerable to cross site scripting
(XSS). This flaw is only exploitable if moodle isn't fully installed
yet. Therefore it's unlikely to be much of a problem in practice. To
actually exploit it an attacker would have to know about a person
that is just about to install moodle (CVE-2008-0123).
- SDL\_image GIF problems
Specially crafted GIF files could crash the SDL\_image library
(CVE-2006-4484).
Updates have been released for SUSE Linux 10.1, openSUSE 10.2
and 10.3.
- python imageop integer overflow
Specially crafted images could trigger an integer overflow in the
imageop module of python (CVE-2007-4965).
Python has been updated on all SUSE Linux based distributions.
- Mysql security problems
The database server MySQL was updated to fix various security
vulnerabilities. Note: not all versions are affected by every bug:
- CVE-2007-2583: a denial of service attack in in\_decimal::set for
logged in users.
- CVE-2007-2691: RENAME TABLE did not require DROP privileges,
allowing remote authenticated users to rename arbitrary tables
- CVE-2007-2692: remote authenticated users could gain privileges
due to a bug in SQL SECURITY INVOKER stored routine handling
- CVE-2007-5925: a denial of service attack by remote authenticated
users via a certain CONTAINS operation on an indexed column
- CVE-2007-5969: allowed remote authenticated users to overwrite
system table information and gain privileges via symlinks
- CVE-2007-6303: allowed remote authenticated users to gain
privileges via CREATE SQL SECURITY DEFINER VIEW and ALTER VIEW
statements
- CVE-2007-6304: denial of service attack by remote authenticated
users by performing a specific SHOW TABLE STATUS query
MySQL has been updated on all SUSE Linux based distributions.
- NX also affected by X.org security problems
This update fixes various Xserver security issues that are also
present in NX:
XInput Extension Memory Corruption Vulnerability [IDEF2888 CVE-2007-6427].
TOG-CUP Extension Memory Corruption Vulnerability [IDEF2901 CVE-2007-6428].
EVI Extension Integer Overflow Vulnerability [IDEF2902 CVE-2007-6429].
MIT-SHM Extension Integer Overflow Vulnerability [IDEF2904 CVE-2007-6429].
- xemacs commandline buffer overflow
A buffer overflow in xemacs commandline handling was
fixed. (CVE-2007-6109)
This problem affected only openSUSE 10.3.

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

Package        : mysql-dfsg, mysql-dfsg-5.0, mysql-dfsg-4.1
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2583, CVE-2007-2691, CVE-2007-2692
                 CVE-2007-3780, CVE-2007-3782, CVE-2007-5925
Debian Bug     : 426353, 424778, 424778, 451235

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the MySQL database packages
with implications ranging from unauthorized database modifications to
remotely triggered server crashes.

CVE-2007-2583

	The in_decimal::set function in item_cmpfunc.cc in MySQL
	before 5.0.40 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
	denial of service (crash) via a crafted IF clause that results
	in a divide-by-zero error and a NULL pointer dereference.
	(Affects source version 5.0.32)

CVE-2007-2691

	MySQL does not require the DROP privilege for RENAME TABLE
	statements, which allows remote authenticated users to rename
	arbitrary tables. (All supported versions affected.)

CVE-2007-2692

	The mysql_change_db function does not restore THD::db_access
	privileges when returning from SQL SECURITY INVOKER stored
	routines, which allows remote authenticated users to gain
	privileges.  (Affects source version 5.0.32)

CVE-2007-3780

	MySQL could be made to overflow a signed char during
	authentication. Remote attackers could use specially crafted
	authentication requests to cause a denial of
	service. (Upstream source versions 4.1.11a and 5.0.32
	affected.)

CVE-2007-3782

	Phil Anderton discovered that MySQL did not properly verify
	access privileges when accessing external tables. As a result,
	authenticated users could exploit this to obtain UPDATE
	privileges to external tables.  (Affects source version
	5.0.32)

CVE-2007-5925

	The convert_search_mode_to_innobase function in ha_innodb.cc
	in the InnoDB engine in MySQL 5.1.23-BK and earlier allows
	remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service
	(database crash) via a certain CONTAINS operation on an
	indexed column, which triggers an assertion error.  (Affects
	source version 5.0.32)

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch3 of the mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.0.24-10sarge3 of mysql-dfsg and version
4.1.11a-4sarge8 of mysql-dfsg-4.1

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

Description:
If a stored routine is declared as SQL SECURITY INVOKER,
we have a security flaw, that allows the user to raise
privileges.

Inspired by [BUG#25082](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=25082).

The problem is that in mysql_change_db() we have no_access attribute
(this attribute is TRUE, when mysql_change_db() is called from
sp_head::execute()). If this attribute is TRUE, we do not check
privileges on the new db, neither we change database privileges.
So, actually, we change privileges when we switch to the routine's
database, but do not change them when we switch back.

The problem happens only when the routine is defined with SQL SECURITY
INVOKER. With SQL SECURITY DEFINER, security context is switched properly
to the definer and then back to the invoker.

This bug affects every object, that uses stored routines, that is triggers,
stored procedures and functions.

How to repeat:
--
-- Login as root@mysql
--

CREATE DATABASE db1;
CREATE DATABASE db2;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON db1.* TO u1@localhost;

CREATE PROCEDURE db1.p1() SQL SECURITY INVOKER SELECT 1;

--
-- Login as u1@db2
--

CREATE TABLE t1(c INT);
--> Error: CREATE command denied to user 'u1'@'localhost' for table 't1'

CALL db1.p1();

CREATE TABLE t1(c INT);
--> Success!!! (it is a security breach)

--
-- Login as u1@db2
--

CREATE TABLE t1(c INT);
--> Error: CREATE command denied to user 'u1'@'localhost' for table 't1'
```

A patch for this bug has been committed. After review, it may
be pushed to the relevant source trees for release in the next
version. You can access the patch from:

  <http://lists.mysql.com/commits/23293>

ChangeSet@1.2423, 2007-03-29 16:21:50+04:00, anozdrin@booka.opbmk +5 -0
  Fix for [BUG#27337](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=27337): Privileges are not properly restored.

  The problem was that THD::db_access variable was not restored after
  database switch in stored-routine-execution code.

  The fix is to restore THD::db_access in this case.

  Unfortunately, this fix requires additional changes,
  because in prepare_schema_table(), called on the parsing stage, we checked
  privileges. That was wrong according to our design, but this flaw haven't
  struck so far, because it was masked. All privilege checkings must be
  done on the execution stage in order to be compatible with prepared statements
  and stored routines. So, this patch also contains patch for
  prepare_schema_table(), which moves the checkings to the execution phase.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-588-1: MySQL vulnerabilities

19 March 2008

MySQL vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [mysql-dfsg-5.0](/security/cves?package=mysql-dfsg-5.0) -

## Details

Masaaki Hirose discovered that MySQL could be made to dereference

a NULL pointer. An authenticated user could cause a denial of service

(application crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION\_SCHEMA

table. This issue only affects Ubuntu 6.06 and 6.10. ([CVE-2006-7232](/security/CVE-2006-7232))

Alexander Nozdrin discovered that MySQL did not restore database access

privileges when returning from SQL SECURITY INVOKER stored routines. An

authenticated user could exploit this to gain privileges. This issue

does not affect Ubuntu 7.10. ([CVE-2007-2692](/security/CVE-2007-2692))

Martin Friebe discovered that MySQL did not properly update the DEFINER

value of an altered view. An authenticated user could use CREATE SQL

SECURITY DEFINER VIEW and ALTER VIEW statements to gain privileges.

([CVE-2007-6303](/security/CVE-2007-6303))

Luigi Auriemma discovered that yaSSL as included in MySQL did not

properly validate its input. A remote attacker could send crafted

requests and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary

code. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 6.06 in the default installation.

([CVE-2008-0226](/security/CVE-2008-0226), [CVE-2008-0227](/security/CVE-2008-0227))
