{
  "CVE-2007-2692": {
    "Description": "The mysql_change_db function does not restore THD::db_access privileges when returning from SQL SECURITY INVOKER stored routines, which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges. (Affects source version 5.0.32)",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mysql_change_db` function in MySQL fails to restore the database access privileges (specifically, the `THD::db_access` variable) after executing a stored routine declared with `SQL SECURITY INVOKER`. This occurs when switching back from the routine's database to the caller's database.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper privilege management",
      "Incorrect context switching"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated database user could gain elevated privileges within the database system, potentially allowing them to perform actions they would normally not be authorized to execute. This includes creating or modifying database objects they should not have access to.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote",
      "Network access to the MySQL server"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
        "The attacker must be an authenticated user with a connection to the MySQL server.",
       "The attacker requires the ability to call or execute stored procedures."
      ]
