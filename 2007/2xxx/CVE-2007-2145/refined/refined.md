{
  "related": true,
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `index.php` script when creating a new gallery. The script allows arbitrary PHP code to be injected into a file name, specifically within the `image` parameter, which is then processed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Code injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code into a filename which is then executed when the file is accessed, allowing for complete control of the target system.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `index.php` with a specially crafted `input`, `list`, and `image` parameters. Specifically the `image` parameter is injected with php code using %00 to null terminate the filename.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and know the web application path."
