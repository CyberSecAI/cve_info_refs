Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability exists due to insecure handling of the `path` parameter in several PHP files within the Web Slider 0.6 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unvalidated Input:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `path` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path.
*   **Remote File Inclusion:** The application includes and executes the content of the file specified through the `path` parameter. This could be a local or remote file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include and execute malicious code from a remote server on the vulnerable web server.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the web server and potentially the underlying system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `path` parameter in the URL.
*   **Affected Files:** The vulnerable files include:
    *   `index.php`
    *   `modules/pdf.php`
    *   `plugins/highlight.php`
    *   `include/modules.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Basic Understanding of Web Technologies:** The attacker should be familiar with sending GET requests and setting parameters.
*   **Remote File Hosting:** The attacker would ideally require a web server to host their malicious code to be included on the victim server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The Exploit-DB entry confirms the vulnerability and specifies the affected application as "Web Slider 0.6".
*   The exploit details the way to trigger the vulnerability using the `path` parameter.
*   The exploit example is shown as `[Path]/index.php?path=Shell` which demonstrates how to specify a remote shell script to be included.
