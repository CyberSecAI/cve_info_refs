```
{
  "Root cause": "The application's `atk.inc` file includes another file based on the value of the `config_atkroot` parameter without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL that contains a `config_atkroot` parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have a publicly accessible server to host malicious code."
