{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `newsadmin.php` script directly includes files based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI). The `action` parameter in `newsadmin.php` allows including arbitrary files from a remote server.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious file from a remote location. This could lead to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to `newsadmin.php` with a crafted `action` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make a web request to the server running the vulnerable application and host a malicious file on a reachable server."
