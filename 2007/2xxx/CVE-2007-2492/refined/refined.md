        "source": "www.exploit-db.com_19297e4d_20250125_132635.html",
        "vulnerability": {
          "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `journal_comment` function of the `v4bJournal` module.",
          "weaknesses": [
            "SQL Injection"
          ],
           "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially allowing access to sensitive data such as usernames and passwords from the `nuke_users` table.",
          "attack_vectors": [
            "HTTP GET request to index.php with a crafted `id` parameter within the `v4bJournal` module"
          ],
          "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.  Registration on the target system may be necessary to reach the vulnerable endpoint.",
           "details": "The provided exploit uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve user information from the `nuke_users` table by manipulating the `id` parameter. Specifically, the exploit uses `id=-1/**/union/**/select/**/0,pn_uname,pn_pass,3,4,pn_uname,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14/**/from/**/nuke_users/**/where/**/pn_uid=2/*`. This demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL code through the vulnerable parameter to extract data."
