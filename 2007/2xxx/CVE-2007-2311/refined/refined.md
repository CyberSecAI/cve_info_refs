Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability present in bloofoxCMS 0.2.2. The `install/index.php` script directly includes a file specified via the `content_php` parameter without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application allows an attacker to include a remote file by manipulating the `content_php` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `content_php` parameter is not properly validated or sanitized, allowing arbitrary URLs to be passed as a file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file (e.g., a shell script) from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to full compromise of the server, including data theft, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `install/index.php` script with a malicious value provided to the `content_php` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Script:** The attacker needs to know the location of the `install/index.php` script and the `content_php` parameter.
