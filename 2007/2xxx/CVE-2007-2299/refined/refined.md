  "CVE-2007-2299": {
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the 'dzial' parameter of katalog.php, the 'd' and 't' parameters of forum.php, and the 't' parameter of forum/viewtopic.php.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "SQL Injection"
        ],
        "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the database, such as administrator login credentials (username and password).",
        "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to vulnerable PHP files with specially crafted SQL queries embedded in the parameters.",
        "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required for the attack."
      }
    ],
    "additional_information": "The provided exploit code demonstrates how to extract admin login and password by injecting SQL queries into the vulnerable parameters. Three different vulnerabilities are exploited using slightly different SQL injections in the 'katalog.php', 'forum.php', and 'forum/viewtopic.php' files."
