How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-1326                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                               Steve Kemp

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : fireflier-server
Vulnerability  : insecure temporary files
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2837

Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered that
fireflier-server, an interactive firewall rule creation tool, uses
temporary files in an unsafe manner which may be exploited to remove
arbitary files from the local system.

For the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.5-1sarge1.

For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.6-3etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed shortly.

We recommend that you upgrade your fireflier-server package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Subject: CVE-2007-2837: Arbitary file removal
Date: Sun, 1 Jul 2007 19:28:36 +0100
```

Package: fireflier-server
Version: 1.1.6-3
Severity: grave
Usertags: sourcescan

*** Please type your report below this line ***

  Security issue: [CVE-2007-2837](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2837).

  The server, fireflierd, runs with root privileges and the code
 contains this gem which I think speaks for itself:

string getRule(unsigned int chainid, int rulenum)
{
   ...

   cmd="rm -f /tmp/fireflier.rules && touch /tmp/fireflier.rules &&
        chmod 0700 /tmp/fireflier.rules && ";
   cmd+=IPTABLES_SAVE;
   cmd+=" > /tmp/fireflier.rules";
   if(DEBUG)
     cout<<"cmd: "<<cmd<<endl;

   system(cmd.c_str());

   ...
}

  This contains several race conditions, and can be trivially exploited to
 remove any file on the server as root.

  For example run this as a user inside GNU screen:
   skx@vain:~$ while true; do ln -s  /etc/passwd  /tmp/fireflier.rules; done

  Wait for a root user to fetch/update/delete a rule using one of the available
 clients, and the /etc/passwd file will be removed.

Hi,

I agree that this code could become a problem, although I wasn't able to
reproduce using screen and the command written in your mail.
Anyways - what really might happen is that the file is overwritten, not
deleted, as rm should delete the link not the file the link points to.
Nevertheless, this doesnt make a big difference, so I will add your fix
to the official version of fireflier.

thanks,
Martin Maurer
(main developer, and original author of that code)

  I could reproduce this using the -qt version of the client.  First of
 all adding some rules, then bringing up the rule list and removing one
 of them.

  That is generally true.  I'm trying to remember whether it was
 unlinked and I'm 99% certain it was, rather than truncated/trashed.

  Thanks a lot.

I uploaded fireflier-1.1.7 to unstable, which fixes this bug by applying
the changes from Steve Kemp to fireflier-1.1.6.
In fireflier-1.1.7 no other changes were done.

thanks,
Martin
