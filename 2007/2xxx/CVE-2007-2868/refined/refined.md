Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from crashes within the JavaScript engine of Mozilla products, specifically related to memory corruption. These crashes were discovered by Brendan Eich, Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman, moz_bug_r_a4 and Wladimir Palant. The root cause was a flaw in how the JavaScript engine handled certain operations and memory management related to functions, closures, and scopes

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The primary weakness is the potential for memory corruption within the JavaScript engine. The specific nature of the memory corruption is not described in detail by most sources, but it leads to crashes and potential code execution.
*   **Incorrect Scope Handling:**  Bug 369666 on bugzilla.mozilla.org indicates incorrect scope handling when inner functions are declared within let-induced outer function body blocks. Specifically,  the engine was not properly managing cloned block scope objects and stack-stored values for inner functions
*   **Bytecode Generation Flaws**: Bug 367561 on bugzilla.mozilla.org points to issues in the byte code emission process for method calls, property sets and constant setting for larger number of atoms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most significant impact is the potential for an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine by triggering the memory corruption vulnerability.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability could also lead to a denial-of-service by crashing the application.
*   **Information Exposure:** In conjunction with other related flaws (CVE-2007-2870 & CVE-2007-2871) it could result in XSS attacks, spoofing/phishing attempts or the exfiltration of other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could host a malicious web page designed to trigger the vulnerability when visited by a user.
*   **Malicious Emails:** For email clients like Thunderbird, if JavaScript is enabled (which is disabled by default), a specially crafted malicious email could be used as an attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, as the attack vectors involve web pages and email.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the user to interact with the malicious content (e.g., visiting a page, opening a malicious email).

**Additional Technical Details (from bugzilla.mozilla.org):**

*   **Specific Code Issue (Bug 351102):** The issue is related to the `try/catch-guard/finally` bytecode and was identified as GC-unsafe. The exception storage was not properly handled by not preserving the original exception which led to dangling pointers after a GC was triggered in the scope of exception handling
*   **Stack Corruption (Bug 369666):** An incorrect implementation of block scope handling could allow the program to try to read from bad memory address when dealing with functions declared in a  `let` scope and are then called. The engine was not properly managing cloned block scope objects and stack-stored values for inner functions.
*   **Atom Index Assumption (Bug 367561):** The engine assumes atom index are always lower than 64k in `JSOP_(GET|SET)METHOD and JSOP_SETCONST`. A malicious page or script can generate more than 64k atoms, which will cause the engine to read from an invalid address during the byte code execution.

**Affected Products (from various sources):**

*   Mozilla Firefox (multiple versions)
*   Mozilla Thunderbird (multiple versions)
*   SeaMonkey (multiple versions)
*   XULRunner
*   Icedove (Debian's rebranded Thunderbird)
*   Iceweasel (Debian's rebranded Firefox)
*   Other applications using the vulnerable Mozilla components

**Mitigation (from the sources):**

*   Upgrade to fixed versions of Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey and XULRunner, which addresses all the listed flaws
*   Disable JavaScript in mail clients, such as Thunderbird.

**Additional notes:**
*   The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild as reported by US-CERT
*   Multiple bug reports related to this CVE exist and were fixed in the mentioned releases of the affected products
