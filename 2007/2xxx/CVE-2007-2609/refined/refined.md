{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application suffers from multiple Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerabilities exist in several PHP files due to insecure handling of include paths using the `ETCDIR` and `LIBSDIR` parameters.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a remote file, potentially containing malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP requests by manipulating the `ETCDIR` and `LIBSDIR` parameters in the vulnerable PHP files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and must have access to a remote file containing malicious PHP code."
