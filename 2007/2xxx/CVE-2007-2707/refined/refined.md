Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-2707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** flaw. It exists due to the `dirpath_linksnet_newsfeed` parameter in `linksnet_linkslog_rss.php` not being properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsanitized Input:** The `dirpath_linksnet_newsfeed` parameter within the `linksnet_linkslog_rss.php` script is vulnerable to RFI, indicating a lack of proper input validation/sanitization of user-supplied data. This allows for arbitrary file inclusion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By including a remote file, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to full system compromise.
*   **Data theft:** Inclusion of a crafted remote file could result in data being leaked from the vulnerable system.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker could manipulate the website by executing malicious scripts via the RFI vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `linksnet_linkslog_rss.php` script, with the `dirpath_linksnet_newsfeed` parameter pointing to a malicious remote file hosted by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and must be able to send HTTP requests to it.
*   **Hosting/Access to malicious file:** The attacker must host the malicious file on a server they control or have access to, so it can be included by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable software is **Linksnet Newsfeed version 1.0**.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by **ThE TiGeR**.
*   The exploit was published on **2007-05-14**.
*   The exploit was also published on **milw0rm.com** on the same date.
