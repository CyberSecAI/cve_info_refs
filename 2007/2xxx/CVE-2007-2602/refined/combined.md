Multiple vulnerabilities
Michal Bucko (sapheal)
HACKPL Security Labs
####################################################################
The document below was mainly written to support MoAxB, however,
some of the vulnerabilities are in no way connected with ActiveX.
The document covers five vulnerabilities, three of them concern ActiveX
controls.
The list:
[1] Ipswitch WhatsUp v11 MIBEXTRA.EXE Memory Corruption Conditions
[2] Firebird 2.1 Multiple Memory Corruption Conditions
[3] Audio CD Ripper OCX Init Function Denial of Service Vulnerability
[4] FlexLabel ActiveX Control Denial of Service
[5] Brujula Toolbar BRUJULA4.NET.DLL Denial of Service
[1] Ipswitch WhatsUp v11 MIBEXTRA.EXE Memory Corruption Conditions
##################################################################
I. BACKGROUND
WhatsUp Gold v11 - award winning network monitoring software - delivers
on its two promises of blending network monitoring and comprehensive
windows-based application with ease of use, allowing IT managers to turn
network data into actionable business information like trending analysis
and IT resource planning guidance.
II. DESCRIPTION
MIBEXTRA.EXE is one of the WhatsUp's components. It extract WUG data from
MIB files. The component itself is prone to buffer overflow. An overly
long argument passed as a filename would result in application crashing.
Arbitrary code execution is possible. The debugger's output is depicted
below:
EAX 00000000
ECX 41414141
..
EIP 41414141
[2] Firebird 2.1 Multiple Memory Corruption Conditions
######################################################
I. BACKGROUND
Firebird is a RDBMS offering many ANSI SQL features that runs on Linux,
Windows and several Unix platforms. Features excellent concurrency, high
performance and a powerful language for stored procedures and triggers.
II. DESCRIPTION
I haven't gone through the code thoroughly as I bumped into various typical
buffer overrun vulnerabilities. I got off to a flying start when I took a
look at config\ConfigFile.cpp - a typical buffer overflow vulnerability,
no bounds checking. Going through with (quite a) fine tooth, I found the
similar (more complex than the one found before?) in msgs\check\_msgs.epp.
[3] Audio CD Ripper OCX Init Function Denial of Service Vulnerability
#####################################################################
I. BACKGROUND
Audio CD Ripper OCX 1.0 is an ActiveX control for developers. This control
can rip CDA tracks from audio CD to MP3, WMA, WAV, OGG and APE. This
ActiveX
can also deal with the ID3 tags (for destination files), runs on a low
level
mode (based on ASPI), supports many CDs drives, can get general information
about the CD drives, the Audio CD and the CDA Tracks on it. Supports many
events, error handling, runs fast and easy to the use.
II. DESCRIPTION
Function Init() in AudioCDRipperOCX.ocx improperly used results in denial
of service due to null dereference. The vulnerability doesn't allow remote
arbitrary code execution.
[4] FlexLabel ActiveX Control Denial of Service
#####################################################################
I. BACKGROUND
FlexLabel is an enhanced label control...way enhanced! You have complete
control
over everything including font, alignment, mouse-over effect, and angle of
text,
plus the best functionality is that it will automatically create a
hyperlink based
off of simple property settings. You can control whether a mouse click
will link
to email, a website, an FTP site, or user customizable link.
II. DESCRIPTION
FlexLabel ActiveX control fails to work properly when badly initialized.
The
vulnerability does not allow code execution. The simple demonstration would
be:
--//code snippet//--
<object classid='clsid:584B432E-E0BD-4A78-BD77-665591DA84BB' id='target' />
<script language='vbscript'>
arg="A"
target.Caption = arg
</script>
--//end of code snippet//--
[5] Brujula Toolbar BRUJULA4.NET.DLL Denial of Service
#####################################################################
I. BACKGROUND
Brujula.net toolbar is one of toolbars available
II. DESCRIPTION
Access violation due to null dereference leads to denial of service
conditions.
Function GetPropertyById(char\*, char\*) in SoftomateLib (ISoftomateObj),in
BRUJULA4.NET.DLL, improperly handle the given arguments. Below, we can see
debugger's output:
100283B5 8B51 04 MOV EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[ECX+4]
ECX = 000001A8
DS:[000001AC]=???
