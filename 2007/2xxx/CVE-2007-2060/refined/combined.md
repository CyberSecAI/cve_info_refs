## The Wizz RSS Reader chrome access vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#319464

Original Release Date: 2007-04-16 | Last Revised: 2007-04-17

---

### Overview

The Wizz RSS Reader contains a vulnerability that may allow an attacker to take any action that Mozlla Firefox can.

### Description

| The Mozilla Firefox user interface components outside of the content area are created using [chrome](http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe/ConfigChromeSpec.html). This includes toolbars, menu bars, progress bars, and window title bars. Chrome provides content, locale, and skin information for the user interface. [The Wizz RSS reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/424/) is an extension to Mozilla Firefox that searches and displays RSS feeds.  The Wizz RSS Reader reader contains a vulnerability. This vulnerability occurs because The Wizz allows javascript in an RSS feed's [DOM](http://www.w3.org/DOM/#what) to be executed in the context of the Wizz RSS Reader's chrome window. Note that to exploit this vulnerability an attacker would have to convince a user to load a specially crafted RSS feed using The Wizz. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to take any action that Mozilla Firefox is capable of performing. This includes downloading arbitrary files, redirecting browser requests, and access stored passwords. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Upgrade**Version [2.1.9](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/424) of the Wizz RSS reader has been released to address this vulnerability. Users are encouraged to update to version 2.1.9 as soon as possible. |

### [Wizz Computers](#MIMG-6ZKP4T) Affected

Notified:  March 23, 2007  Updated: April 16, 2007

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Description of Problem:

Wizz RSS News Reader version 2.1.7 (Including earlier versions) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits. A "quick fix" was applied to version 2.
1.8, but the fix was found to be very weak and, in most cases, ineffectual. The vulnerability allowed non-trusted scripts, injected into various RSS and Atom
 feeds, to execute within the trusted chrome space of the Firefox web browser.

Problem Resolution:

Wizz RSS News Reader version 2.1.9 includes a fix for the above mentioned cross-site scripting vulnerability. In version 2.1.9, all feeds are "sanitized" as
they are parsed.

It is very highly recommended that ALL users of Wizz RSS News Reader upgrade to version 2.1.9, as soon as they possibly can.

Version 2.1.9 can be installed from <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/424>
