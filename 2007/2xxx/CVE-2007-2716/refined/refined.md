Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `$show` variable in the `listmembers.php` file of EQDKP version 1.3.2c and prior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a non-persistent XSS. This means that the malicious script is injected through a URL parameter and is executed when the page is loaded. It is not stored on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the vulnerable page. This can lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies to impersonate legitimate users.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data displayed on the page.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or forcing downloads of malware.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance or functionality of the webpage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the exploit payload in the `show` parameter of the `listmembers.php` file. For example: `$path-to-eqdkp/listmembers.php?show=%22%3E%3Cplaintext%3E`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and trick a user into visiting it.
*   No special privileges are required on the target system to perform the attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is not limited to just listmembers.php but exists wherever the `$show` variable is used without proper sanitization in the application.
* The provided example payload `%22%3E%3Cplaintext%3E` demonstrates the injection of HTML tags in the context of the vulnerable page.
