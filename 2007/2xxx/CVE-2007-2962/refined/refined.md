Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application (Particle Gallery 1.0.1 and below) does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the output HTML. Specifically the `order` parameter within the `search.php` script is vulnerable to this.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.
- This injected code can be executed within the browser of other users who interact with the vulnerable page.
- The impact is rated as "Low" by the reporting source, though the CVSS score is 4.3/10

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning the attacker does not need local access to the server.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL and enticing the victim to visit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes the JavaScript payload.
- The attacker must be able to get a victim to click/visit this crafted URL

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof-of-concept URL is: `http://site/apppath/search.php?user=admin&order=>"><ScRiPt%20%0a%0d>alert(1111110)%3B</ScRiPt>`
- This URL shows how the `order` parameter is not sanitized, allowing the attacker to inject the `<script>` tags, in turn executing Javascript.
- The vulnerable script is `search.php`

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected application is Particle Gallery version 1.0.1 and below.
- The vulnerability affects Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, and Sun platforms.
- There is no fix available at the time of reporting.
- The vendor's website was not available.
