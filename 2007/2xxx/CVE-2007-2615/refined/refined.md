Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-2615:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) in PHPLojaFacil 0.1.5.
*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `path_local` parameter in several PHP files (e.g., `ftp.php`, `db.php`, `libs/ftp.php`). This allows an attacker to include remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application does not properly sanitize the `path_local` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify a URL to a malicious PHP file that will be included and executed by the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious PHP file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can read sensitive files.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests with the `path_local` parameter containing the URL of a malicious file to include.
*   **Vulnerable Files:** Specific PHP files such as `ftp.php`, `libs/db.php`, and `libs/ftp.php` are identified as vulnerable entry points.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Malicious File Hosting:** The attacker must have a web server to host the malicious PHP file that will be included.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the `path_local` parameter and the vulnerable PHP files.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides specific example URLs for exploitation:
    *   `[Path]/ftp.php?path_local=Shell`
    *   `[Path]/libs/db.php?path_local=Shell`
    *   `[Path]/libs/ftp.php?path_local=Shell`
*   The exploit was discovered and published by GoLd\_M on 2007-05-08.

This analysis provides more detail than the standard CVE description, which would generally only state that it is an RFI vulnerability.
