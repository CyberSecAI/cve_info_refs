# Filter Actions

* Article
* 11/17/2009
## In this article

Applies To: Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2

A filter action defines the security requirements for the data transmission. Filter actions can be defined when you create a policy or before you create a policy. Filter lists are available to any policy. To define a filter list, right-click the IP Security Policy node and select **Manage filter lists and filter actions**.

A filter action can be configured to:

## Permit traffic

IPsec passes this traffic to and from the TCP/IP driver without modification or the requirement for security. This is appropriate for traffic from computers that are not IPsec-capable. Be sure to limit the IP filter list to a minimal scope when using this type of filter action, so that you do not permit traffic that should be secured.

Consider allowing ICMP traffic for troubleshooting purposes. You might also need to allow a computer that is not in your domain (for example, a consultant's computer) access to another computer in your domain. You can use the permit filter action to allow this access.

Important

The permit filter action allows access without authentication, data integrity, or encryption. Anyone using a computer with the IP address specified in the filter list is given the access. All traffic between the computers is done in plaintext; no integrity checks are performed.

## Block traffic

IPsec silently discards blocked traffic. When using a blocking filter action, be sure to use an IP filter list that defines the correct scope of IP addresses. Using larger scopes increases the chance of blocking traffic between valid computers.

## Negotiate security

If you enable the **Accept unsecured communication, but always respond using IPSec** option, IPsec attempts to negotiate security associations (SAs) and the sending or receiving of IPsec-protected traffic. However, if the peer cannot use IPsec, the communication will be allowed without IPsec protection. After you choose this filter action, you can also configure the following:

* Security methods and their order. This list of methods defines in which order the methods will be attempted. The first successful method will be used and the remaining methods will not be attempted. Typically, the list should be ordered from highest security to lowest security, so that the most secure method is used.
* Acceptance of initial incoming unsecured traffic (**Accept unsecured communication, but always respond using IPSec**). IPsec allows an incoming packet that matches the configured filter list to be unsecured (that is, not protected by IPsec). However, the outgoing response to the incoming packet must be protected. This setting is useful when you are using the default response rule for clients. When a group of servers are configured with a rule that secures communications with any IP address and accepts unsecured communication, responding with only secured communications, enabling the default response rule on client computers ensures that the clients will respond to the server request to negotiate security. To prevent denial-of-service attacks, this option should be disabled for secure computers connected to the Internet.
* Enabling of communication with non-IPsec-enabled computers (**Allow unsecured communication if a secure connection cannot be established**). IPsec falls back to unsecured communication, if necessary. Again, you should limit the IP filter list to a minimal scope. Otherwise, if negotiation fails for any reason, any communications affected by the rule in which this filter action resides could result in data being sent without security. If you are concerned about unsecured communication, you might consider disabling these settings. However, communication with computers that cannot initiate IPsec, such as legacy systems, might be blocked. To prevent denial-of-service attacks, this option should be disabled for secure computers connected to the Internet.
* Generation of quick mode session keys from new main mode keying material (**Session key perfect forward secrecy (PFS)**). Enabling session key PFS ensures that main mode master keying material cannot be used to derive more than one quick mode session key. When quick mode PFS is enabled, a new Diffie-Hellman key exchange is performed to generate new main mode master keying material before the new quick mode key is created. Session key (quick mode) PFS does not require main mode reauthentication and uses fewer resources than master key (main mode) PFS.

## IPsec security methods

Each security method defines the security requirements of any communications to which the associated rule applies. Creating multiple security methods increases the chance that a common method can be found between two computers. The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) component reads the list of security methods in descending order and sends a list of allowed security methods to the other peer. The first method in common is selected. Typically, the most secure methods appear at the top of the list; the least secure methods appear at the bottom of the list.

### Predefined security methods

The following security methods are predefined:

#### Encryption and Integrity

Uses the ESP protocol to provide data confidentiality (encryption) with the triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) algorithm, data integrity and authentication with the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1) integrity algorithm, and default key lifetimes (100 megabytes (MB), 1 hour). If you require both data and addressing (IP header) protection, you can create a custom security method. If you do not require encryption, use Integrity only.

#### Integrity only

Uses the ESP protocol to provide data integrity and authentication with the SHA1 integrity algorithm and default key lifetimes (100 MB, 1 hour). In this configuration, ESP does not provide data confidentiality (encryption).

#### Custom security methods

If the predefined Encryption and Integrity or Integrity only settings do not meet your security requirements, you can specify custom security methods. For example, you can use custom methods when encryption and address integrity, stronger algorithms, or key lifetimes must be specified. When configuring a custom security method, you can configure the following:

##### Security protocols

Both AH (data and address integrity without encryption) and ESP (data integrity and encryption) can be enabled in a custom security method when you require IP header integrity and data encryption. If you chose to enable both, you do not need to specify an integrity algorithm for ESP.

Note

The AH protocol cannot be used over network address translation (NAT) devices because it uses a hash of the header. NAT devices alter the header, so the packet will not authenticate properly.

##### Integrity algorithm

Message Digest 5 (MD5), which uses a 128-bit key. This algorithm is no longer considered secure and should be used only when interoperability requires its use.

SHA1, which uses a 160-bit key. SHA1 is a stronger hash than MD5 and is compliant with the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).

##### Encryption algorithm

3DES is the most secure of the DES combinations and somewhat slower in performance. 3DES processes each block three times, using three unique 56-bit keys.

DES uses a single 56-bit key and is used when the higher security and overhead of 3DES is not required. This algorithm is no longer considered secure and should only be used when interoperability requires it.

Session key (quick mode) settings determine when, not how, a new key is generated. You can specify a lifetime in kilobytes (KB), seconds, or both. For example, if the communication takes 10,000 seconds and you specify the key lifetime as 1000 seconds, 10 keys will be generated to complete the transfer. This ensures that, even if an attacker manages to determine one session key and decipher part of a communication, the attacker cannot decipher the entire communication. By default, new quick mode keys are generated for every 100 MB of data or every hour. Any time a key lifetime is reached, the SA, in addition to the key refresh or regeneration, is also renegotiated.

**To create a filter action using the New Rule Properties dialog box**

1. On the **Rules** tab of the **IP Security Policy Properties** dialog, clear the **Use Add Wizard** check box if you want to create the filter action in the property dialog box. If you want to use the wizard, leave the check box selected. Click **Add**. The following instructions are for creating a filter list using the dialog box.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Windows 2000 SP4 Windows XP SP2 Windows 2003 SP1 Windows Vista |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['5657']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to crash systems with vulnerable installations of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the RPC runtime library rpcrt4.dll during the parsing of RPC-level authentication messages. When parsing packets with the authentication type of NTLMSSP and the authentication level of PACKET, an invalid memory dereference can occur if the verification trailer signature is initialized to 0 as opposed to the standard NTLM signature. Successful exploitation crashes the RPC service and subsequently the entire operating system. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## RPC Authentication Vulnerability Could Allow Denial of Service - CVE-2007-2228

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the remote procedure call (RPC) facility due to a failure in communicating with the NTLM security provider when performing authentication of RPC requests. An anonymous attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RPC authentication request to a computer over the network. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause the computer to stop responding and automatically restart.

#### Mitigating Factors for RPC Authentication Vulnerability Could Allow Denial of Service - CVE-2007-2228

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect networks from attacks that originate outside the enterprise perimeter. Best practices recommend that systems that are connected to the Internet have a minimal number of ports exposed.

#### Workarounds for RPC Authentication Vulnerability Could Allow Denial of Service - CVE-2007-2228

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Block the following at the firewall:**

  + UDP ports 135, 137, 138, and 445, and TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593
  + All unsolicited inbound traffic on ports greater than 1024
  + Any other specifically configured RPC port

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with RPC. Blocking them at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Also, make sure that you block any other specifically configured RPC port on the remote system. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports that RPC uses, visit the following [Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  \*\*Impact of Workaround:\*\*Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below.

  Applications that use SMB (CIFS)

  Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)

  Server (File and Print Sharing)

  Group Policy

  Net Logon

  Distributed File System (DFS)

  Terminal Server Licensing

  Print Spooler

  Computer Browser

  Remote Procedure Call Locator

  Fax Service

  Indexing Service

  Performance Logs and Alerts

  Systems Management Server

  License Logging Service
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, use a personal firewall, such as Windows Firewall, which is included with Windows XP and with Windows Server 2003.**

  By default, the Windows Firewall feature in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 helps protect your Internet connection by blocking unsolicited incoming traffic. We recommend that you block all unsolicited incoming communication from the Internet.

  To enable the Windows Firewall feature by using the Network Setup Wizard, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start** and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Network Connections** and then click **Change Windows Firewall settings**.
  3. On the **General** tab, ensure that the **On (recommended)** value is selected. This will enable the Windows Firewall.
  4. Once the Windows Firewall is enabled, select **Donât allow exceptions** to prohibit all incoming traffic.

  **Note** If you want to enable certain programs and services to communicate through the firewall, de-select **Donât allow exceptions** and click the **Exceptions** tab. On the Exceptions tab, select the programs, protocols, and services that you want to enable.

  \*\*Impact of Workaround:\*\*Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below.

  Applications that use SMB (CIFS)

  Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)

  Server (File and Print Sharing)

  Group Policy

  Net Logon

* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, enable advanced TCP/IP filtering on systems that support this feature.**

  You can enable advanced TCP/IP filtering to block all unsolicited inbound traffic. For more information about how to configure TCP/IP filtering, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 309798](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/309798).
* **To help protect from network-based attempts to exploit this vulnerability, block the affected ports by using IPSec on the affected systems.**

  Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190) and [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878).

#### FAQ for RPC Authentication Vulnerability Could Allow Denial of Service - CVE-2007-2228:

**What is Microsoft RPC Authentication?**

To complete any remote procedure call, all distributed applications must create a binding between the client and the server. Microsoft RPC provides multiple levels of authentication. Depending on the authentication level, the origin of the traffic (which security principal sent the traffic) can be verified when the connection is established, when the client starts a new remote procedure call, or during each packet exchange between the client and server. For additional information on RPC and RPC Authentication please see the following [MSDN Article](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/library/aa378646.aspx).

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a [denial of service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142) vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding and automatically restart. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Specially crafted packets using the NTLMSSP authentication type can cause the RPC service to fail in such a way that could cause the system to restart.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could a userâs system to become non-responsive and restart.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted RPC message and sending the message to an affected system over an affected TCP/UDP port. The message could then cause the RPCSS service to stop responding and cause the vulnerable system to fail in such a way that it could cause a denial of service.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. Firewall best practices and standard default firewall configurations can help protect against attacks that originate from the Internet.

| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information**File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

  **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with /quiet, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |

**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
