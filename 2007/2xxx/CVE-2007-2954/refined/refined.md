{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-2954",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `nwspool.dll` file of the Novell Netware Client.",
      "weaknesses": "The `nwspool.dll` component does not properly validate argument sizes when handling RPC requests via the spoolss named pipe. This lack of validation allows for user-supplied data to be copied to a stack-based buffer without proper size checks, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote, exploiting RPC functions exposed by `nwspool.dll` via the spoolss named pipe.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability."
