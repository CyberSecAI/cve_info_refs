```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `$GLOBALS['tcore']` variable is not properly sanitized before being used in an `include` statement.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)",
    "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain access to the shell by including a malicious file from a remote server (RFI) or by including a local file, such as /etc/passwd (LFI).",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "By crafting a malicious URL with a modified `GLOBALS[tcore]` parameter."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and needs to know the path of the vulnerable script. The server must also have `register_global` and `allow_url_include` set to `On` for RFI exploitation. LFI does not require `allow_url_include`."
