- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The product scripts have flaws which lead to Warnings or even Fatal Errors. Specifically, a crafted request to `class/page.php` with a malformed `id` parameter triggers a PHP warning that discloses the server's file path. This is caused by the application not properly handling database errors and revealing server path information in error messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path disclosure vulnerability due to inadequate error handling and information exposure through PHP warnings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gather the true path of the server-side script. This information can be leveraged for further attacks such as exploiting other vulnerabilities or gaining unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack by sending a specifically crafted HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and the `magic_quotes_gpc` setting needs to be off on the server.
