  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-3291",

      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],

        "A remote attacker can inject malicious SQL queries into the 'cid' parameter of the categoria.php script."

        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"

     "root_cause": "The application fails to restrict file types that can be uploaded.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Arbitrary File Upload"
      ],
        "impact": "An attacker can upload malicious scripts, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server and full compromise of the server.",

          "A user can upload malicious scripts via the file upload mechanism for article images."

     "weaknesses": [
        "Absolute Path Disclosure"
      ],
        "impact": "The absolute path is revealed when the application throws a mysql error, which could potentially expose sensitive information about the server's file structure and aid in further exploitation.",
