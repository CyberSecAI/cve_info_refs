    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "A null pointer dereference in the sysfs_readdir function within the Linux kernel.",
      "Weaknesses": "The `sysfs_readdir` function fails to validate a pointer to an inode in a dentry before dereferencing it. This lack of validation allows an attacker to trigger the vulnerability by crafting a scenario where the inode pointer is null.",
      "Impact": "A local user can cause a denial of service (kernel panic/OOPS) by exploiting the null pointer dereference, causing the system to crash.",
      "Attack vector": "Local access. A user with local access to the system can trigger the vulnerability.",
      "Required capabilities": "Local user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability."
    },
      "Additional Information":{
        "Affected Component": "sysfs_readdir function"
    }
