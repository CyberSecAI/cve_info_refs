How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CSTeX: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-34**

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in CSTeX, possibly allowing to
execute arbitrary code or overwrite arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/cstetex** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.2-r2** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

CSTeX is a TeX distribution with Czech and Slovak support. It is used
for creating and manipulating LaTeX documents.

### Description

Multiple issues were found in the teTeX 2 codebase that CSTeX builds
upon (GLSA 200709-17, GLSA 200711-26). CSTeX also includes vulnerable
code from the GD library (GLSA 200708-05), from Xpdf (GLSA 200709-12,
GLSA 200711-22) and from T1Lib (GLSA 200710-12).

### Impact

Remote attackers could possibly execute arbitrary code and local
attackers could possibly overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges
of the user running CSTeX via multiple vectors.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

CSTeX is not maintained upstream, so the package was masked in Portage.
We recommend that users unmerge CSTeX:

```
 # emerge --unmerge app-text/cstetex
```

As an alternative, users should upgrade their systems to use teTeX or
TeX Live with its Babel packages.

# GD: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200708-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GD, allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/gd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.35** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.35** |

### Background

GD is a graphic library for fast image creation.

### Description

Xavier Roche discovered an infinite loop in the gdPngReadData()
function when processing a truncated PNG file (CVE-2007-2756). An
integer overflow has been discovered in the gdImageCreateTrueColor()
function (CVE-2007-3472). An error has been discovered in the function
gdImageCreateXbm() function (CVE-2007-3473). Unspecified
vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GIF reader (CVE-2007-3474).
An error has been discovered when processing a GIF image that has no
global color map (CVE-2007-3475). An array index error has been
discovered in the file gd\_gif\_in.c when processing images with an
invalid color index (CVE-2007-3476). An error has been discovered in
the imagearc() and imagefilledarc() functions when processing overly
large angle values (CVE-2007-3477). A race condition has been
discovered in the gdImageStringFTEx() function (CVE-2007-3478).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit one of these vulnerabilities to cause a
Denial of Service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running GD.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All GD users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/gd-2.0.35"
```

I can see mutexes in the code for the font cache so there must be a code path that's missed.  Backtrace: <http://public.vbulletin.com/bugs/php/gd_thread_safety-bt.txt>  Reproduce code: <http://public.vbulletin.com/bugs/php/gd_thread_safety.phps> <http://public.vbulletin.com/bugs/php/HECK.TTF>  Command: ab -c 30 -n 10000 <http://localhost/~scott/gd_thread_safety.php>  Using Apache 2 with the Worker MPM.  Only patch applied to the build is a thread safety patch for zend_strtod.c    ``` PatchesPull RequestsHistoryAllCommentsChangesGit/SVN commitsRelated reports  **[2007-02-21 14:40 UTC] scottmacvicar at ntlworld dot com** ``` Should probably class this as a crash.  ``` **[2007-02-21 15:00 UTC] [tony2001@php.net](//people.php.net/tony2001)** ``` This bug has been fixed in CVS.  Snapshots of the sources are packaged every three hours; this change will be in the next snapshot. You can grab the snapshot at <http://snaps.php.net/>.   Thank you for the report, and for helping us make PHP better.  And again - very nice reproduce case & report, thanks.  ``` **[2007-02-21 15:42 UTC] [pajoye@php.net](//people.php.net/pajoye)** ``` I reported the issue in GD too:  <http://bugs.libgd.org/?do=details&task_id=48>  Will be fixed in 2.0.35.  Thanks for your patch and nice reproduce case!  ``` **[2007-02-21 18:24 UTC] scottmacvicar at ntlworld dot com** ``` Any chance of having this backported to the PHP_4_4 branch? It's a fairly minor patch to apply.  ``` **[2007-02-21 18:41 UTC] [tony2001@php.net](//people.php.net/tony2001)** ``` Also backported to 4_4.  ``` **[2007-02-22 00:39 UTC] scottmacvicar at ntlworld dot com** ``` Has this potentially caused a regression?  I applied the patch that was checked in CVS this afternoon  and  recompiled PHP.  Had another segfault in GD, here is the backtrace.  Unfortunately it wasn't a debug build.  Thread 13 (process 27300): #0  0x009457a2 in _dl_sysinfo_int80 () from /lib/ld- linux.so.2 No symbol table info available. #1  0x00985c46 in kill () from /lib/tls/libc.so.6 No symbol table info available. #2  0x0807e646 in sig_coredump (sig=11) at mpm_common.c:1170 No locals. #3  <signal handler called> No symbol table info available. #4  0x009bf652 in malloc_consolidate () from /lib/tls/ libc.so.6 No symbol table info available. #5  0x009bfd30 in _int_free () from /lib/tls/libc.so.6 No symbol table info available. #6  0x009c033a in free () from /lib/tls/libc.so.6 ---Type <return> to continue, or q <return> to quit--- No symbol table info available. #7  0x003d5b8a in ??

I can try a debug build but the segfaults are occuring less  frequently now.  ``` **[2007-02-22 00:57 UTC] [pajoye@php.net](//people.php.net/pajoye)** ``` It looks like something else.  Can you try:  <http://pecl.php.net/~pierre/40568.txt>    ``` **[2007-02-22 01:48 UTC] scottmacvicar at ntlworld dot com** ``` Applied now to one of our production boxes, When I'm back in  the office tomorrow I'll see if I can spend a little time  working out a test case to reproduce it.  ``` **[2007-02-23 00:52 UTC] scottmacvicar at ntlworld dot com** ``` Been going for almost 24 hours now without any more crashes,  the patch makes sense though. Since there was another race  condition on shutdown if one thread is accessing the cache  while another is trying to delete it.  ``` **[2007-02-23 01:04 UTC] [pajoye@php.net](//people.php.net/pajoye)** ``` This bug has been fixed in CVS.  Snapshots of the sources are packaged every three hours; this change will be in the next snapshot. You can grab the snapshot at <http://snaps.php.net/>.   Thank you for the report, and for helping us make PHP better.  Fixed in 5.2 and HEAD.  Thanks for the tests  ``` **[2007-02-23 01:12 UTC] scottmacvicar at ntlworld dot com** ``` Antony backported the initial fix to PHP_4_4, can this be  backported too please.  ``` **[2007-02-23 08:18 UTC] [derick@php.net](//people.php.net/derick)** ``` Yes, sure.  ``` |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# PTeX: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200805-13**

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in PTeX, possibly allowing the
execution of arbitrary code or overwriting arbitrary files.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-text/ptex** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.1.10\_p20071203** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.1.10\_p20071203** |

### Background

PTeX is a TeX distribution with Japanese support. It is used for
creating and manipulating LaTeX documents.

### Description

Multiple issues were found in the teTeX 2 codebase that PTeX builds
upon (GLSA 200709-17, GLSA 200711-26). PTeX also includes vulnerable
code from the GD library (GLSA 200708-05), from Xpdf (GLSA 200709-12,
GLSA 200711-22) and from T1Lib (GLSA 200710-12).

### Impact

Remote attackers could possibly execute arbitrary code and local
attackers could possibly overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges
of the user running PTeX via multiple vectors, e.g. enticing users to
open specially crafted files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PTeX users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/ptex-3.1.10_p20071203"
```

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.
