      "cve": "CVE-2007-3290",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_a7218e56_20250124_151047.html",
      "details": "LiveCMS <= 3.4 is vulnerable to multiple issues:\n\n*   **SQL Injection:** The `categoria.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `cid` parameter. By manipulating the `cid` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query. Specifically, the provided exploit uses `UNION ALL SELECT` to extract usernames and passwords from the `live_admin` table.\n*   **Absolute Path Disclosure (APD):** The absolute path of the server is disclosed in a MySQL error when the `categoria.php` script is queried with a non-defined `cid` variable, such as `categoria.php?cid='`.\n*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Article names are not properly sanitized, allowing a user to insert malicious JavaScript code.\n*   **Arbitrary File Upload (AFU):** The CMS does not restrict file types that can be uploaded as article images, enabling an attacker to upload malicious scripts and potentially compromise the server.",
      "vulnerability": "SQL Injection, Absolute Path Disclosure, Cross-Site Scripting, Arbitrary File Upload",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the web application, including unauthorized access to the database, disclosure of sensitive information, execution of arbitrary code on the server, and defacement of the website.",
        "attack_vector": "HTTP requests with crafted parameters. Requires the vulnerable application to be accessible through the web.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running the vulnerable LiveCMS application. No authentication is needed for the SQL injection vulnerability in `categoria.php`."
