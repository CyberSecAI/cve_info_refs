CVE-2007-3522:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The sPHPell application includes files based on a user-controlled parameter, "SpellIncPath", without proper sanitization.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can include arbitrary remote files, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
  - Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exposed through the "SpellIncPath" GET parameter in multiple files (spellcheckpageinc.php, spellchecktext.php, spellcheckwindow.php, and spellcheckwindowframeset.php).
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, they can be located anywhere.
