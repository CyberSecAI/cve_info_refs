Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `news_id` parameter within the `index.php` file of Pagetool version 1.07. Specifically, the application fails to validate or escape user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is SQL Injection (SQLi). This occurs because the application directly incorporates the value of the `news_id` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to manipulate the SQL query. This could lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration: An attacker could extract sensitive information from the database such as usernames and passwords of other users by manipulating the SQL query to retrieve data from other tables.
    *   Data modification: An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
    *   Complete compromise: In some cases, a skilled attacker may be able to use SQL injection to gain complete control of the underlying database server.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request. The vulnerable `news_id` parameter can be manipulated through a URL.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application.
    *   No authentication is needed.
    *   The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax.

**Technical Details:**

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability by injecting SQL commands into the `news_id` parameter:
`http://www.site.com/[path]/index.php?name=pagetool_news&news_id=-1/**/union/**/all/**/select/**/null,/**/null,/**/CONCAT(0x557365726E346D653A20,/**/username),/**/CONCAT(0x50617373773072643A20,/**/passwd),/**/null/**/from/**/pt_core_users/**/where/**/user_id=1`

This crafted query uses:

*   `-1` : to ensure the original query returns no results.
*   `union all select`: to combine the results of the original query with a new query defined by the attacker.
*   `null`: to match the column structure of the original query.
*   `CONCAT(0x557365726E346D653A20,username)` and `CONCAT(0x50617373773072643A20,passwd)`: to extract the username and password from the `pt_core_users` table.
*  `from pt_core_users where user_id=1`: to specifically target a user with id `1`.

The SQL injection allows the attacker to retrieve sensitive information about a specific user from the database.
