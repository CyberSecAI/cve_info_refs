Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `$spaw_root` variable in the `spaw_control.class.php` file of the XOOPS Module icontent. This file includes other files based on the path specified in `$spaw_root`, making it susceptible to remote file inclusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is RFI. By manipulating the `$spaw_root` variable, an attacker can force the application to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server.
*   **Insecure Configuration:** The exploitation requires `register_globals` to be enabled, which is a known insecure PHP configuration. This setting allows external parameters to directly overwrite script variables, creating a vulnerability.
*   **Vulnerable Third-Party Component:** The vulnerability is present in the SPAW PHP WYSIWYG editor, a third-party component used by the XOOPS icontent module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **System Manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate system configurations, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that includes a manipulated `spaw_root` parameter pointing to a remote malicious file. This parameter is typically passed via the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable `icontent` module and the path to the vulnerable file, specifically `spaw_control.class.php`.
*   **Web Browser or Scripting Ability:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable server.
*   **Target System with PHP `register_globals` Enabled:** The vulnerable server must have PHP `register_globals` enabled for successful exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is similar to an issue previously reported in phpwcms related to the same SPAW editor.
*   The provided exploit code demonstrates how to construct the malicious URL and send it to the target.
*   The exploit uses `?spaw_root=` parameter and injects a remote URL pointing to the attacker's shell.

This analysis provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability described by CVE-2007-3057, along with the technical specifics, impact, and methods of exploitation.
