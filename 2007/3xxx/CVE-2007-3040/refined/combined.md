## Agent Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-3040

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Agent in the way that it handles certain specially crafted URLs. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to remotely execute code on the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-3040](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3040).

#### Mitigating Factors for Agent Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-3040

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.

#### Workarounds for Agent Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2007-3040

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Temporarily prevent the Agent ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer**

  You can help prevent attempts to instantiate this ActiveX control in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.

  To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {D45FD31B-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D45FD31B-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}]

  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{F5BE8BD2-7DE6-11D0-91FE-00C04FD701A5}]

  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{4BAC124B-78C8-11D1-B9A8-00C04FD97575}]

  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D45FD31D-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}]

  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  [HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D45FD31E-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}]

  "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400

  You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:

  + [Group Policy collection](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd)
  + [What is Group Policy Object Editor?](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a3)
  + [Core Group Policy tools and settings](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc9491)

  **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.

  **Impact of workaround:** Web sites that use the Microsoft Agent ActiveX Control will no longer work correctly via Internet Explorer.
* **Unregister AgentSvr.exe**

  Enter the following at a command line or in a logon or machine startup script:

  `%windir%\msagent\agentsvr.exe /unregserver`

  **Impact of workaround:** Microsoft Agent will no longer work.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX Controls or disable ActiveX Controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone.**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **ActiveX controls and plug-ins** section, under **Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK.**
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zoneâ.

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. To continue receiving security updates from Microsoft, add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and you must have an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to âHighâ to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to **High**.

  To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to **High** may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to **High**.

  **Impact of Workaround:** There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message or attachment), an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The attacker could also cause the web browser to crash.More information is available in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-051](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-051.mspx). |

| **Disable the Microsoft Agent ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer**The vulnerable ActiveX controls can be disabled in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the following CLSIDs:  {D45FD31B-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}{F5BE8BD2-7DE6-11D0-91FE-00C04FD701A5}{4BAC124B-78C8-11D1-B9A8-00C04FD97575}{D45FD31D-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}{D45FD31E-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}More information about how to set the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Support Document 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Alternatively, the following text can be saved as a .REG file and imported to set the kill bit for this control:Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D45FD31B-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{F5BE8BD2-7DE6-11D0-91FE-00C04FD701A5}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{4BAC124B-78C8-11D1-B9A8-00C04FD97575}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D45FD31D-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{D45FD31E-5C6E-11D1-9EC1-00C04FD7081F}]"Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400**Unregister AgentSvr.exe**The Microsoft Agent ActiveX controls interact with the Microsoft Agent Server (AgentSvr.exe) to provide Agent functionality. The Microsoft Agent Server can be unregistered to mitigate this vulnerability by running the following command:%windir%\msagent\agentsvr.exe /unregserver**Disable ActiveX**Disabling ActiveX controls in the Internet Zone (or any zone used by an attacker) appears to prevent exploitation of this and other ActiveX vulnerabilities. Instructions for disabling ActiveX in the Internet Zone can be found in the "[Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/#Internet_Explorer)" document. |
