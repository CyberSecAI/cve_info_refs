  "CVE-2007-3799": {
    "description": "The session_start function in ext/session in PHP 4.x up to 4.4.7 and 5.x up to 5.2.3 allows remote attackers to insert arbitrary attributes into the session cookie via special characters in a cookie that is obtained from (1) PATH_INFO, (2) the session_id function, and (3) the session_start function, which are not encoded or filtered when the new session cookie is generated. A vulnerability was discovered in PHP session cookie handling, allowing an attacker to create a cross-site cookie insertion attack if a victim follows an untrusted carefully-crafted URL.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `session_start` function fails to properly encode or filter special characters from a cookie when generating a new session cookie. This allows an attacker to insert arbitrary attributes into the session cookie.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
	"Cookie injection"
      ],
      "impact": "Cross-site cookie insertion that could allow an attacker to stop a victim from viewing a vulnerable web site, or potentially lead to altered application behavior, possibly gaining additional privileges",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "Untrusted URLs",
	 "Specially-crafted messages",
        "Cookies with special characters in PATH_INFO, session_id or session_start"
        ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL or message which injects special characters into session cookies.",
      "attacker_position": "Remote attacker"
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "PHP 4.x up to 4.4.7",
      "PHP 5.x up to 5.2.3",
	  "Ubuntu 7.10"
    ],
    "patch_details": "The vulnerability was fixed by adding a proper encoding step when setting the session cookie, specifically by using `php_url_encode` function.  The missing header `ext/standard/url.h` was also included which prevented the function from being implicitly declared.",
    "notes": "This vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHSA-2007-0888, RHSA-2007-0889, RHSA-2007-0890, RHSA-2007-0891), Debian (DSA-1444-1, DSA-1578-1) and Ubuntu (USN-549-2)."
