Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of an authentication bypass and a directory traversal flaw in the `file.cgi` script of Secure Computing's SecurityReporter application. The script improperly handles the `name` parameter, which is used to specify the file to be accessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Authentication Bypass:** The script attempts to bypass authorization checks based on the file path provided in the `name` parameter. Specifically, if the path starts with `/eventcache/` or ends with `.gif`, the script sets a `$dontvalidate` variable to true, which disables user validation. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication if these conditions are met.
2. **Directory Traversal:** The script fails to properly sanitize the input provided in the `name` parameter. It doesn't normalize the input, or filter out `..`, `/`, and `\`, allowing for directory traversal. The script uses the provided name value directly in file open operations after prepending `../`. This allows an attacker to access files outside of the intended application root directory.
3. **Lack of Input Validation:** The script has insufficient input validation.  It doesn't check for malicious characters or path components (like `..`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive configuration files, source code, or any other files the webserver process has access to.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposing internal files can reveal sensitive system details and application logic, which can then be used for further attacks.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Access to certain system files can be used to elevate privileges or to further compromise the server, including potential for code execution based on file writes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through HTTP requests.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker sends a specially crafted GET request to the `file.cgi` script with a `name` parameter designed to trigger the authentication bypass and directory traversal.
*   **`name` parameter manipulation:** The `name` parameter is manipulated by the attacker to include `../` sequences and a path to a target file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running SecurityReporter.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the `file.cgi` script and its parameters.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP GET requests.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Oliver Karow on June 5, 2007.
*   The affected version is SecurityReporter 4.6.3 Build Date: 04/20/2007.
*   The application can be installed with either a dedicated Apache server or using a pre-existing IIS installation. When installed using Apache, the file access is executed with local system privileges.
*   The vendor has released a patch and notified customers via email.
* The document also mentions that an earlier version may have been vulnerable to a null-byte attack via the `.gif` regex, but this has been fixed in the current version via `GeneralUtilities.pm`.
