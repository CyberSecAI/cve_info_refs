Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3086:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is insufficient protection of the `outpost_ipc_hdr` mutex by Outpost Firewall PRO. Any arbitrary process can open and capture this mutex.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Mutex Handling:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control on the `outpost_ipc_hdr` mutex. It's accessible to any process, allowing unauthorized manipulation.
- **Lack of Synchronization:** When an arbitrary process captures the mutex, Outpost cannot use it for its synchronization mechanisms, leading to a deadlock state.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation leads to a denial of service, where Outpost becomes unresponsive, and critical operations such as running new processes are blocked.
- **System Reboot:** The user is forced to reboot the system because the mutex cannot be released once captured by a malicious process. The release cannot be enforced by any user-level process or by the user itself.
- **Availability Impact:** The primary impact is a complete loss of availability for the Outpost firewall and related system functions reliant on it.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local, meaning the malicious process needs to be running on the same machine as the vulnerable Outpost Firewall software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the local system.
- **Mutex Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to open and capture the `outpost_ipc_hdr` mutex using a program with proper privileges to interact with mutexes.
- **No Authentication Required:** No special privileges or authentication are needed other than the ability to run a local process.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Outpost Firewall PRO 4.0 (versions 1007.591.145 and 964.582.059), and likely all older versions of Outpost Firewall PRO 4.0 and possibly older versions of Outpost Firewall PRO.
-  A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, including source code, was made available for the public.
- The CVSS base score is 4.9, with an Impact subscore of 6.9 and an Exploitability subscore of 3.9, reinforcing a local low-complexity attack with complete availability impact.
