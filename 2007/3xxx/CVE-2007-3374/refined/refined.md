{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `process_client` function in cman/daemon.c uses a static buffer without proper size validation when receiving client messages. The buffer is not cleaned, potentially retaining data from prior use, and lacks an upper boundary check when reading from the socket.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Insufficient Input Validation",
	  "Improper buffer initialization"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user can send a specially crafted message larger than the buffer, causing memory corruption. This can lead to a crash of the cluster manager (cman/aisexec), resulting in a denial of service (DoS). In a more severe scenario, it could allow for arbitrary code execution with cluster manager privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker connects to the cman daemon via a socket and sends a specially crafted message.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local user with the ability to connect to the cman daemon is required."
