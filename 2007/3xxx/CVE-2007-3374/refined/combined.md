How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Description of problem:

The funcion process\_client in cman/daemon.c uses a static buffer

of size MAX\_CLUSTER\_MESSAGE + sizeof(struct sock\_header).

MAX\_CLUSTER\_MESSAGE is 1500 bytes and struct sock\_header at the timing of filing

this bug is 20 bytes.

2 problems are discovered here and fixed by the patch committed to head (see url).

The buffer is never cleaned and so data from previous usage will stay in the new

one.

There is no upper boundary check if the data we are reading from the socket are

larger than the buffer itself.

It was fairly simple to connect to cman and push a random 1520 bytes in the

socket that will corrupt memory and eventually crash cman/aisexec.

How reproducible:

always

Additional info:

cvs HEAD has been fixed but i am told to submit a BZ for people to look into the

different release branches.

Patrick has been informed and agreed on the solution on CVS head.

Submitting the bug on Lon request.

## Topic

Updated cman packages that correct a security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

cman is the Red Hat Cluster Manager.

A flaw was found in the cman daemon. A local attacker could connect to the
cman daemon and trigger a static buffer overflow leading to a denial of

Users of Cluster Manager should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 5 x86\_64

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=244891#c0)  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto    2007-06-19 18:20:31 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The funcion process_client in cman/daemon.c uses a static buffer of size MAX_CLUSTER_MESSAGE + sizeof(struct sock_header). MAX_CLUSTER_MESSAGE is 1500 bytes and struct sock_header at the timing of filing this bug is 20 bytes.  2 problems are discovered here and fixed by the patch committed to head (see url).  The buffer is never cleaned and so data from previous usage will stay in the new one.  There is no upper boundary check if the data we are reading from the socket are larger than the buffer itself.  It was fairly simple to connect to cman and push a random 1520 bytes in the socket that will corrupt memory and eventually crash cman/aisexec.  How reproducible:  always  Additional info:  cvs HEAD has been fixed but i am told to submit a BZ for people to look into the different release branches.  Patrick has been informed and agreed on the solution on CVS head.  Submitting the bug on Lon request.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=244891#c1)  Christine Caulfield    2007-06-21 07:40:19 UTC  ``` Check in for RHEL5  Checking in daemon.c; /cvs/cluster/cluster/cman/daemon/daemon.c,v  <--  daemon.c new revision: 1.32.2.2; previous revision: 1.32.2.1 done    ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=244891#c3)  RHEL Program Management    2007-06-21 16:33:35 UTC  ``` This request was evaluated by Red Hat Product Management for inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux maintenance release.  Product Management has requested further review of this request by Red Hat Engineering, for potential inclusion in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Update release for currently deployed products.
