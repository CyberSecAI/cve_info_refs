Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the `spaw_control.class.php` file of the WiwiMod module for XOOPS. The `spaw_root` parameter is used to include files, and this parameter is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary remote files.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary weakness is the insecure inclusion of files based on a user-controlled parameter (`spaw_root`).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `spaw_control.class.php` file, including the `spaw_root` parameter set to a malicious URL.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable XOOPS installation.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Module:** The attacker needs to know that the WiwiMod module is installed and vulnerable.
    *   **Remote File Hosting:** The attacker needs a server or resource to host the malicious file to be included.

**Additional Details:**

* The exploit example provided is: `/modules/wiwimod/spaw/spaw_control.class.php?spaw_root=Shell.txt?` which demonstrates how to inject a remote file.
*   The vulnerable code snippet shows how the `spaw_root` variable is directly used in include statements:
  ```php
  include $spaw_root.'config/spaw_control.config.php';
  include $spaw_root.'class/toolbars.class.php';
  include $spaw_root.'class/lang.class.php';
  ```
