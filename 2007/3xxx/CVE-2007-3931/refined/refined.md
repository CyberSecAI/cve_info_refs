      "source": "linuxfr.org_a1d80a1c_20250124_191124.html",
      "root_cause": "The Samsung unified Linux printer driver installation script incorrectly modified permissions and ownership of system files and executables.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The installer script replaces OpenOffice executables with setuid-root wrapper scripts, allowing users to run the application with root privileges.",
		"The installer script modifies the owner of `/etc` to the current user, instead of `root`, which allows normal users to write to /etc."
      ],
      "impact": "Users can run applications like OpenOffice, xsane, and xscanimage with root privileges without being prompted for a password, allowing them to potentially modify or delete system files and gain full control over the system.",
      "attack_vectors": "Installation of the malicious Samsung printer drivers.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Requires the user to install the provided Samsung printer drivers. The installation process itself elevates privileges."

      "root_cause": "The Samsung Linux printer drivers installer uses setuid-root inappropriately.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The installer changes permissions on system executables, setting the setuid bit, allowing users to execute them as root.",
        "The installer replaces original executables with wrapper scripts that execute with root privileges."
      ],
      "impact": "Users can run applications like OpenOffice, xsane, and xscanimage with root privileges, potentially leading to system compromise.",
