Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before being displayed on the web page. Specifically, input passed to the "search", "show", "searchtype", "catid", and "searchtxt" parameters in the "search.asp" file of rwAuction Pro is not sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code into a user's browser session, within the context of the affected website. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
  - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the vulnerable parameters in the `search.asp` page, specifically "search", "show", "searchtype", "catid", and "searchtxt" parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable `search.asp` page, including malicious scripts in the vulnerable parameters. This can typically be done remotely via a web browser.
- The attacker does not require any specific level of access to the application.
- The vulnerability is present in rwAuction Pro v5.0, and possibly other versions as well, including prior 4.x versions

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in rwAuction Pro 4.x and was not patched in the 5.0 version.
- The blog post provided a sample payload to demonstrate the vulnerability: `%22%3Cscript%3Ealert('r0t')%3C/script%3E`.
- The vendor initially disputed the findings, stating that the input was sanitized, but later the author of the blog post provided a working payload.

**Summary**
The content provided describes a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in rwAuction Pro due to unsanitized user input in several parameters of the search.asp page. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the user's browser.
