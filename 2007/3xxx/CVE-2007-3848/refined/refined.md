  "CVE-2007-3848": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux kernel did not properly reset the parent process death signal (PR_SET_PDEATHSIG) on SUID binary execution.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of process death signals, allowing a child process to inherit a parent process death signal from a parent process, even when executing a SUID binary. The pdeath_signal was not being reset correctly under certain conditions, which may allow local users to gain privileges by sending arbitrary signals to SUID binaries.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Local users can escalate privileges by sending arbitrary signals to processes they would not normally have access to, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. A local user could also cause a denial of service.",
       "Attack vectors": "A local unprivileged attacker can exploit this by setting a parent death signal and then executing a setuid-root binary, which, if the parent dies, would send a signal to the now-privileged process.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local unprivileged access to a vulnerable system is required."
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux kernel checked the wrong global variable for the CIFS sec mount option, which might allow remote attackers to spoof CIFS network traffic that the client configured for security signatures",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present":"The Linux kernel allowed local users to send arbitrary signals to a child process that is running at higher privileges by causing a setuid-root parent process to die, which delivers an attacker-controlled parent process death signal (PR_SET_PDEATHSIG).",
      "Impact of exploitation":"Local users could gain privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries. The Linux kernel checked the wrong global variable for the CIFS sec mount option, which might allow remote attackers to spoof CIFS network traffic that the client configured for security signatures. ",
      "Attack vectors":"Local attackers exploit the vulnerability through specially crafted signal handling during setuid-root parent process termination, or by spoofing CIFS network traffic.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position":"Local or remote attacker capabilities."
