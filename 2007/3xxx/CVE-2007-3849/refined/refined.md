Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect configuration within the `aide` package in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (RHEL5). Specifically, the `configure` script in `aide` version 0.12 incorrectly tests for `WITH_LIBGCRYPT` instead of `WITH_GCRYPT`. This leads to the cryptographic library `libgcrypt` not being properly utilized, resulting in several integrity checks being silently ignored.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Integrity Checks:** The core issue is that critical integrity tests like `md5`, `sha1`, `rmd160`, `tiger`, `sha256`, and `sha512` are not performed, even when specified in the `aide.conf` configuration file.
*   **Silent Failure:** The failure to perform these tests is silent; the software doesn't report an error. Instead, it appears to operate normally, misleading the user into thinking these checks are in place.
*   **Database Inconsistency:** The `aide` database created by version 0.12 stores checksum values, but due to the above issues, the attribute flags indicating which tests are used for each file are incorrect.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Integrity Monitoring:** The intended function of `aide`, which is to detect unauthorized changes to files, is severely compromised. An attacker could potentially modify files on a system, and `aide` would fail to detect these changes due to the missing integrity checks.
*   **False Sense of Security:** Administrators relying on `aide` for system integrity are given a false sense of security, believing that their systems are being properly monitored for file changes, when in fact critical checks are not in place.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct File Modification:** An attacker could directly modify files on a vulnerable system, and if relying on `aide` version 0.12 the changes will likely not be detected.
*   **Configuration Bypass:** An attacker could exploit the silent failure to perform integrity tests, allowing them to alter system files without triggering an alert from aide.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs access to the file system of the vulnerable system to modify files.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability to take advantage of the missing checks.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The bug report indicates that the fix for this issue involves rebasing `aide` to version 0.13.1, which corrects the libgcrypt configuration issue and includes several bug fixes.
*   A patch was considered to make `aide` detect the issue and prompt the admin to regenerate the database.
*   The issue was resolved in Red Hat Enterprise Linux with the release of RHSA-2007:0539.
*   The vulnerability is specific to how `aide` is configured and built in RHEL5, not an upstream bug, allowing for the security fix to be released as an async errata.
