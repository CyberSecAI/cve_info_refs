  "CVE-2007-3456": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Minded Security Advisory": {
      "Root cause": "Integer overflow in Adobe Flash interpreter when parsing a specially crafted FLV video file.",
       "Weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Improper Input Validation",
        "Memory Corruption"
      ],
      "Impact": "Client/browser-plugin crash, arbitrary code execution, or system denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": [
         "Maliciously crafted FLV video file",
        "Remote web site hosting the malformed video",
         "SWF player loading a malicious FLV file"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create and host a malicious FLV video file. Can be through a website or another method that causes a Flash player to load the file.",
      "Technical details": "The vulnerability lies in the way Flash Player processes the 'Long string type' (0x0c) and 'XML' (0x0f) data types within the DataObject section of an FLV file. When a large value (e.g., 0xffffffff) is supplied for the string length field in a crafted FLV file, an integer overflow occurs during length calculation. This causes a memory corruption due to the `REP MOVS` instruction writing an extremely large buffer, which then allows for the redirection of code execution to an attacker controlled address."
    },
    "CERT Vulnerability Note": {
      "Root cause": "Integer overflow vulnerability in the way some versions of Flash Player handle Flash Video (.flv) media.",
      "Weaknesses": ["Integer Overflow", "Improper Input Validation"],
      "Impact": "Remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on an affected system. The attacker-supplied code would be executed with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable software component.",
      "Attack vectors": ["Specially crafted FLV media content supplied to userâ€™s web browser, email client, or other applications that include or reference the Flash Player."],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create and supply a specially crafted FLV file."
    },
   "Red Hat Security Advisory": {
        "Root cause": "Input validation flaw in the way Flash Player displayed certain content.",
        "Weaknesses": ["Improper Input Validation"],
        "Impact": "Possible execution of arbitrary code on a victim's machine if they open a malicious Adobe Flash file.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "Maliciously crafted Flash file."
         ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create and deliver a malicious Flash file to a user."
      },
   "Secunia Advisory": {
        "Root cause": "Integer Overflow when processing FLV files",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Integer Overflow",
           "Improper Input Validation"
        ],
        "Impact": "Possible execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Macromedia Flash Player or sensitive data access.",
         "Attack vectors": [
          "Specially crafted FLV file"
         ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to entice user to open a specially crafted file."
      },
  "Gentoo Linux Security Advisory": {
        "Root cause": "Boundary error when processing FLV files",
        "Weaknesses": [
           "Integer Overflow",
           "Improper Input Validation"
          ],
        "Impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Macromedia Flash Player, or sensitive data access.",
         "Attack vectors": [
         "Specially crafted file"
         ],
