```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a local file inclusion flaw in the `sendcard.php` script. The `sc_language` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI) which leads to remote code execution.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve remote code execution by injecting malicious PHP code into server logs, then including those logs with the LFI vulnerability and executing the injected code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `sendcard.php` with a modified `sc_language` parameter to point to a log file, and a `cmd` parameter to inject and execute a command.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable `sendcard.php` application. The attacker does not need any prior authentication."
