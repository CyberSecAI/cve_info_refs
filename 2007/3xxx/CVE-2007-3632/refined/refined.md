{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in several PHP files within the LimeSurvey application. Specifically, the 'homedir' parameter in multiple files are vulnerable to remote file inclusion",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can remotely include and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server hosting LimeSurvey. This can lead to complete compromise of the application and potentially the server, allowing the attacker to gain control of the system, steal sensitive data, modify content, or disrupt services.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is via HTTP requests targeting the vulnerable files with a crafted 'homedir' parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server and specify a URL containing the malicious PHP code in the 'homedir' parameter."
