      {
        "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of input in categoria.php via the 'cid' parameter.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "SQL Injection (SQLi)"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information (like admin usernames and passwords), data modification, or other unauthorized database operations.",

            "HTTP GET request to categoria.php with a crafted 'cid' parameter."
           ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required."
      },
      {
         "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of article names.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious javascript code into the application which could then be executed in a victim's browser.",
          "attack_vectors": [
            "Inserting malicious javascript in the article names."
           ],
           "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to add articles to the site, typically as a registered user, in order to inject the malicious code."
       },
       {
        "root_cause":"Lack of file type restrictions on image uploads.",
        "weaknesses":[
           "Arbitrary File Upload"
         ],
          "impact":"An attacker can upload malicious scripts to the server, potentially leading to compromise of the server.",
          "attack_vectors": [
            "Uploading a malicious file when adding or modifying an article."

           "attacker_capabilities":"An attacker needs to have the ability to add or modify articles in order to upload malicious files"
       }
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The exploit also mentions Absolute Path Disclosure (APD) due to a MySQL error revealing the path, which occurs when the 'cid' parameter in categoria.php is queried with a non-defined variable. The exploit script demonstrates how to retrieve the admin username and password by exploiting the SQL Injection vulnerability."
