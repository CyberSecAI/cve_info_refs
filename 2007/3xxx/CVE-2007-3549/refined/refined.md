```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `view_sub_cat.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input passed via the `cat_id` parameter.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation:  An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including administrator usernames and passwords, as well as member email addresses and passwords.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `view_sub_cat.php` script, injecting SQL code into the `cat_id` parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application to exploit it. No authentication or special positioning within the network is required.
