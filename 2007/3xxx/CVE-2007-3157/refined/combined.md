|  |  | | **SafeNET High Assurance Remote/SoftRemote (IPSecDrv.sys) remote DoS** **2007.06.17** Credit:  **[mu-b](https://cxsecurity.com/author/mu-b/1/)**  Risk: **Low** Local: **No** Remote: ****Yes**** CVE: **[CVE-2007-3157](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2007-3157/ "Click to see CVE-2007-3157")** CWE: **N/A** CVSS Base Score: **5/10** Impact Subscore: **2.9/10** Exploitability Subscore: **10/10** Exploit range: **Remote** Attack complexity: **Low** Authentication: **No required** Confidentiality impact: **None** Integrity impact: **None** Availability impact: **Partial** | | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Attached is POC for a remote DoS in IPSecDrv.sys shipped with
SafeNET High Assurance Remote and SoftRemote. The version
tested is 10.4.0.12.
The bug itself is due to SafeNET making a complete hash of IPv6
support for IPSec. The result of the code is a complete DoS of
the machine in Kernel mode whilst the driver proceeds to enter
an infinite loop (apparently looking for a suitable IPSec extension
header, which it will never find). The dodgy code can be found
at offset 0x1000BEB0 of IPSecDrv.sys (10.4.0.12).
The attached code will only work over local subnets, however
this is trivially remote with IPv6.
PoC: http://www.digit-labs.org/files/exploits/safenet-dos.c
hmmm, I wonder how SafeNET think they can charge for such a
half-baked, crufty, god-awful implementation....

\* SafeNet HighAssurance Remote ~1.4.0 Ring0 DoS (win32)
\* by John Anderson
\* mu-b
\* - Mar 2006 - June 2007
\*
\* - Tested on: SafeNet HighAssurance Remote 1.4.0 (Build 12) (win32)
\*
\* Kernel level (Ring0) DoS in IPv6 support of IPSecDrv.sys
\* (causes an infinite loop in searching option headers 0x1000BEB0).
\*
\* This POC only works on a local subnet since it sends an invalid packet
\* and any sensible router will drop it. However, this is exploitable
\* remotely with IPv6.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
