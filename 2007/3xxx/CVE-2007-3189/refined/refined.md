```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `auth.php` file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML into the application, potentially leading to malicious actions on the victim's browser.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by injecting malicious scripts into the `user` parameter of `auth.php`.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application.
