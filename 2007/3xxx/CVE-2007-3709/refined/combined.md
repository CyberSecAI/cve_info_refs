CodeIgniter is a powerful PHP framework with a very small footprint,
built for PHP coders who need a simple and elegant toolkit to create
full-featured web applications.
(http://www.codeigniter.com)
1. \_sanitize\_globals() global variables unsetting
By setting e.g. "\_SERVER=anonymous" cookie in the browser, an attacker
can cause the \_sanitize\_globals() method to remove $\_SERVER array or
any other global variable.
Solution: fixed in SVN (28.06.2007)
2. "enable\_query\_strings" path traversal
$\_GET["c"] variable is vulnerable to path traversal, if
enable\_query\_strings=TRUE is set in config.php. Example:
http://localhost/index.php?c=../../logs/log-2007-06-24
Solution: fixed in SVN (28.06.2007)
3. xss\_clean() XSS vulnerability
Examples:
xss\_clean('<img src=""
onerror="eval(String.fromCharCode(97,108,101,114,116,40,39,33,39,41))">'
);
xss\_clean("<x<xss>ss <scr<xss>ipt
a='>'>alert/\*\*/('!');//\*/</script</script >>");
Solution: partially fixed in SVN (26.06.2007)
I suggest using HTML Purifier in place of xss\_clean()
4. redirect() header injection
redirect() function in url\_helper.php is vulnerable to header
injection attacks (PHP < 4.4.2 or PHP < 5.1.2). Example:
redirect("\r\nSet-Cookie: Test=X");
Solution: filter user data before passing to redirect() function (in
PHP < 4.4.2 or PHP < 5.1.2)
Best regards,
