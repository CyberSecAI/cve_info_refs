Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from eqDKP failing to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `compare` variable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Full Path Disclosure: The application reveals the full server-side path of the eqDKP installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure and the location of the eqDKP installation, which can be valuable for further attacks. This could expose the internal directory structure of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `listmembers.php` with a modified `compare` parameter containing `%00`.
- Example: `/path-to-eqdkp/listmembers.php?compare=%00`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No special privileges or access to the server is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
