Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2007-3028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Windows Active Directory's LDAP service handles client-sent LDAP requests. Specifically, the LDAP service fails to properly validate the number of convertible attributes within the request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper input validation on the number of convertible attributes in the LDAP request. This allows a malicious request to cause issues.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted LDAP request can exploit the validation flaw, causing the Active Directory server to stop responding temporarily.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to the Active Directory server becoming unresponsive, disrupting services that rely on it. This could affect user authentication, access to resources, and other critical operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** An attacker can send a malicious LDAP request over the network to a vulnerable Active Directory server.
- **Specifically crafted LDAP request:** The attacker needs to craft a specific LDAP request that exploits the improper attribute validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable Active Directory server on TCP ports 389 and 3268.
- **LDAP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious LDAP request to trigger the vulnerability.
- On Windows 2000 Server, any anonymous user with network access could potentially exploit the vulnerability. Windows Server 2003 is not vulnerable to this denial of service.

**Additional Notes**

- The vulnerability was reported by Peter Winter-Smith of NGSSoftware.
- Microsoft addressed the vulnerability in their Security Bulletin MS07-039.
- The provided information indicates that this is a denial of service vulnerability and does not allow remote code execution or elevate user rights.
- The security update removes the vulnerability by validating the client sent LDAP request logic.
