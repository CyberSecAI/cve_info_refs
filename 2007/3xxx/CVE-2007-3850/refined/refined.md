{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The eHCA driver on PowerPC architectures had a flaw in how it mapped userspace resources. When mapping a 4k resource into userspace on a system with 64k pages, the driver would incorrectly map an additional 60k of physical address space.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect memory mapping",
       "Information exposure"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user could potentially access sensitive information located within the additional 60k of mapped physical address space.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access",
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access to the system."
