## Synopsis

Important: kernel security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0940)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix various security issues in the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 kernel are now available.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.

These new kernel packages contain fixes for the following security issues:

* A flaw was found in the backported stack unwinder fixes in Red Hat

Enterprise Linux 5. On AMD64 and Intel 64 platforms, a local user could
trigger this flaw and cause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-4574, Important)

* A flaw was found in the handling of process death signals. This allowed a

local user to send arbitrary signals to the suid-process executed by that
user. A successful exploitation of this flaw depends on the structure of
the suid-program and its signal handling. (CVE-2007-3848, Important)

* A flaw was found in the Distributed Lock Manager (DLM) in the cluster

manager. This allowed a remote user who is able to connect to the DLM port
to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2007-3380, Important)

* A flaw was found in the aacraid SCSI driver. This allowed a local user to

make ioctl calls to the driver which should otherwise be restricted to
privileged users. (CVE-2007-4308, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the prio\_tree handling of the hugetlb support that

allowed a local user to cause a denial of service. This only affected
kernels with hugetlb support. (CVE-2007-4133, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the eHCA driver on PowerPC architectures that allowed

a local user to access 60k of physical address space. This address space
could contain sensitive information. (CVE-2007-3850, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in ptrace support that allowed a local user to cause a

denial of service via a NULL pointer dereference. (CVE-2007-3731, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the usblcd driver that allowed a local user to cause

a denial
of service by writing data to the device node. To exploit this issue, write
access to the device node was needed. (CVE-2007-3513, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the random number generator implementation that

allowed a local user to cause a denial of service or possibly gain
privileges. If the root user raised the default wakeup threshold over the
size of the output pool, this flaw could be exploited. (CVE-2007-3105, Low)

In addition to the security issues described above, several bug fixes
preventing possible system crashes and data corruption were also included.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 users are advised to upgrade to these packages,
which contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=308811#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-09-27 12:12:34 UTC  ``` The eHCA driver has a problem with mapping userspace resources.  It's nicely explained in the upstream git submission: Some drivers have resources that they want to be able to map into userspace that are 4k in size.	On a kernel configured with 64k pages we currently end up mapping the 4k we want plus another 60k of physical address space, which could contain anything.  This can introduce security problems, for example in the case of an infiniband adaptor where the other 60k could contain registers that some other program is using for its communications.  Upstream patch: <http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/linuxppc/patch?id=10281> and commit: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=721151d004dcf01a71b12bb6b893f9160284cf6e>  galaxy has a 4k page of control registers for each single QP and CQ. The physical adress of this page is defined by phyp when you allocate a resource.  To be able to send and receive data from userspace without a kernel call you have to get access to that 4k page from userspace. If the linux kernel only allows to map 64k pages into userspace there's a conflict. Phyp only allows to map this page area in 4k chunks (H_ENTER).  * a flaw in the eHCA driver on PowerPC architectures that allowed a local user to access 60k of physical address space.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=308811#c3)  Red Hat Product Security    2008-01-17 15:38:26 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux:   <http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0940.html>     ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Cox    2007-09-20 14:12:21 UTC  ``` The RHEL kernel was missing some stack unwinder fixes which leads to an incorrect CS bit being set, and a kernel OOps.
