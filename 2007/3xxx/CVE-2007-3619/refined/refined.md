    "source": "www.netragard.com_43f89d2e_20250125_054710.html",
    "vulnerability": "A Directory Traversal vulnerability exists in the Maia Mailguard Web Application that enables an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.",
    "description": "Improper input validation on the \"lang\" variable in Maia Mailguard web application has resulted in a Directory Traversal vulnerability that can be used to execute arbitrary commands on he affected system, or, to read arbitrary files on the affected system.",
    "impact": "Arbitrary Code Execution",
    "attack_vector": "By injecting code into the httpd-error.log file and then forcing the web application to read this log file, the injected code is executed.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to connect to the affected system via port 80 and send a crafted GET request that contains malicious code. After injecting the malicious code into the log file the attacker forces the web application to read the log file by crafting another request."

    "vulnerability": "The \"lang\" variable is not verified and can be used to display system files.",
    "description": "The \"lang\" variable, as well as \"prevlang\" and \"super\", lack input validation. By manipulating these variables, an attacker can read system files. It was noted that the vulnerability was easier to exploit on FreeBSD systems, possibly due to a php/filesystem issue. Some systems handle \"%00\" as a null-terminated string, which could truncate the requested filename.",
    "impact": "File read",
     "attack_vector": "Crafting requests with the 'lang', 'prevlang', or 'super' variables to point to files outside of the web application's intended directory.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send a request with a malicious value in the 'lang', 'prevlang', or 'super' parameter. "

    "vulnerability": "Directory Traversal / File Read vulnerability exists in the Maia Mailguard Web Application, which allows arbitrary command execution.",
   "description": "Improper input validation on the \"lang\" variable in Maia Mailguard web application has resulted in a Directory Traversal vulnerability that can be used to execute arbitrary commands on he affected system, or, to read arbitrary files on the affected system. By injecting code into the `httpd-error.log` file via a crafted HTTP request and then forcing the web application to read the log file, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution.",
    "impact": "Arbitrary Code Execution, arbitrary file read.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker first injects code into the `httpd-error.log` file by sending a crafted GET request to the web server. The attacker then uses a directory traversal vulnerability via the 'lang' parameter to force the web application to read the log file, executing the injected code.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable web application. The attacker needs to craft requests to inject code into the log file and then read the log file using the directory traversal vulnerability."
