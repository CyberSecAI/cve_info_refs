Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2007-3947:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of repeated HTTP headers by the lighttpd web server. Specifically, when the server encounters duplicate headers like "Location: h" as shown in the provided request example, it can lead to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Header Handling:** The core issue is how lighttpd processes and stores data associated with HTTP headers. The server does not properly handle repeated headers. The provided debug info shows the crash occurs in `buffer_prepare_copy`, which is responsible for allocating memory for the headers.
- **Memory Corruption:** The debug information shows that the crash occurs because the buffer `b` becomes corrupted, likely due to an attempt to write to a freed or invalid memory location, triggered by the repeated header handling flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request with repeated headers, an attacker can cause the lighttpd webserver to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending HTTP requests containing the malicious header repetition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the lighttpd server.
- **No Authentication Required:** No special access or authentication is necessary to trigger the vulnerability. Any client that can send HTTP requests to the server can exploit it.

**Additional Notes**
- The issue was identified in lighttpd versions prior to 1.4.16 (Gentoo Security Advisory) and 1.4.13-4etch3 (Debian Security Advisory)
- The bug report from lighttpd's bug tracker confirms the vulnerability. The bug report details a segmentation fault occurring when parsing a request with duplicate "Location:" headers.
- The bug was fixed in revision r1869 according to the lighttpd bug tracker.
