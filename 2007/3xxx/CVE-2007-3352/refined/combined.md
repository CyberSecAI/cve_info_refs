How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[![Contact Form](contactform.png)](./)
# Contact Form

A Perl script that you can run on your website that will allow others to send you email
through a web interface. Unlike other web to email gateways, Contact Form is designed to
thwart spammers. It does not allow email to be sent to unknown addresses, nor does it
reveal addresses that it knows.

## Work Flow

[![](https://ostermiller.org/contactform/workflow_sm.png)](https://ostermiller.org/contactform/workflow.html)

Use case: [User wants to contact you using this email form script.](https://ostermiller.org/contactform/workflow.html)

## Design Goals

* Allow email to be sent to a list of known email addresses through a web interface.
* Prevent email from being sent to other addresses.
* Never reveal email addresses through the web interface.
* Contain no cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
* Do not allow arbitrary code to be run on the host.
* Provide adequate information in email headers to trace any spammers.
* Allow, but do not require, an external form.
* Server side validity checking of all data before email is sent.
* Optional client side validity checking of all data before the form is submitted.
* A default configuration that requires only a list of email addresses to be ready for use.
* A customizable interface that allows arbitrary fields.
* Easy to change the look and feel for website integration.
* Able to be easily translated into any language.

## Setup

1. Download the contactform archive.

* If captchas are used, the Captcha::reCAPTCHA::V2 perl module must be installed

  (cpan install Captcha::reCAPTCHA::V2 *or* apt-get install libcaptcha-recaptcha-perl *or* yum install perl-Captcha-reCAPTCHA)
* If external XML file configuration is used, the XML::Simple perl module must be installed

  (cpan install XML::Simple *or* apt-get install libxml-simple-perl *or* yum install perl-XML-Simple)

## Languages

Contact form can be easily translated. See instructions in the contact.pl file of the download. To submit a translation for a new language, [use bugzilla to open a new feature request](https://bugzilla.ostermiller.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=ContactForm) and attach the translations.
It currently comes in the following languages:

* English (en)
* Dutch (nl) [example](https://ostermiller.org/contactform/example_one_address.pl?cflang=nl)
* Pig Latin (pig) (for testing) [example](https://ostermiller.org/contactform/example_one_address.pl?cflang=pig)

## Changes

* Version 5.00.00
  + Upgraded recaptcha to v2. This enables the "check this box" challenge rather than the "decipher these letters" challenge. Note that Google stopped supporting recaptcha v1 on March 31, 2018, so all ContactForm installations will either need to upgrade or disable recaptcha. In most cases upgrading will entail generating new recaptcha keys from Google because old "global" keys cannot be used with V2. The Perl module Captcha::reCAPTCHA::V2 needs to be installed. ContactForm configuration value names were changed to "recaptcha\_site\_key" and "recaptcha\_secret\_key" to match the language currently used by Google.
* Version 4.03.03
  + Added rel canonical meta tag to the HTML
* Version 4.03.02
