Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3575:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL Injection flaw in the `members.php` script of the FreeDomain.co.nr Clone. Specifically, the `logindomain` parameter from POST data is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The code directly uses user-supplied input (`$logindomain`) in the SQL query within the `login_user` function, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
- The specific vulnerable line is `$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM $redir_table WHERE host ='$user_name'")` where `$user_name` is derived directly from the unsanitized `$logindomain`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact (Partial):** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information stored in the database (e.g. other user details, passwords, internal data).
- **Integrity Impact (Partial):** Attackers can potentially modify data within the database (e.g., modify user records, deface the website).
- **Availability Impact (Partial):** Attackers can potentially disrupt the website's functionality by manipulating or deleting data needed by the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network via HTTP requests.
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability exists in `members.php`, where the `$logindomain` parameter is received via an HTTP POST request.
- The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `logindomain` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable website.
- **Basic understanding of SQL Injection techniques:** They need to be able to craft a malicious SQL injection payload.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any prior authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the file `members.php`
- The vulnerable code is found within the `login_user` function in `includes/functions.php`
- The provided content includes a credit to `teh_lost_byte` and `Kw3rln` from Romanian Security Team.
- The CVSS base score is 7.5 with high exploitability of 10.
- The vulnerability allows a partial impact for confidentiality, integrity and availability.
