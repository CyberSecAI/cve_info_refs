Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3618:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the EMC Legato Networker Remote Exec Service, specifically in the `nsrexecd.exe` executable.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a long, invalid sub command is supplied to a poll or kill request.
- The root cause is a stack buffer overflow within a call to the `sprintf()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow.
- Lack of proper input validation of the sub command length.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable EMC Networker installations.
- Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The service is exposed on a SUNRPC portmapper TCP port 111.
- Attackers can query the portmapper for service #0x5f3e1, version 1, to locate the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker with network access to the vulnerable service.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific network request with an overly long, invalid sub command for either a poll or a kill request.

**Additional Details:**
-  EMC has released updates to address this vulnerability, as detailed in knowledge base article esg83899.
-  Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by Digital Vaccine filter ID ['5259'].
