      "vulnerability": "Microsoft Internet Explorer Language Pack Installation Remote Code Execution Vulnerability",
      "details": "The specific flaw exists in routines responsible for the on-demand installation of Internet Explorer language packs. A race condition may occur when a web page contains several pieces of content written in a language not currently supported by any of the installed language packs. In some cases, this race condition results in exploitable memory corruption that can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.",
        "impact": "Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer.",
      "attack_vector": "User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability, the target must visit a malicious page.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can create a malicious page that exploits the vulnerability."

            "vulnerability": "Language Pack Installation Vulnerability",
        "details": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer in the way that it handles language pack installation. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.",
      "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data.",
        "attack_vector": "An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince a user to view the Web site.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious webpage and convince a user to visit it to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website but needs to convince users to visit it.",
        "weakness": "Internet Explorer may attempt to install multiple language packs in such a way that a race condition may occur. As a result, memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.",
          "mitigation": [
             "User interaction, while expected, is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
             "Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista and Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista x64 Edition are not affected by this vulnerability."
