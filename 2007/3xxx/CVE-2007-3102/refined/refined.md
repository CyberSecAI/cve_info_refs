  "CVE-2007-3102": {
    "description": "The logging of failed logins can be used to inject bad information into audit logs. Example: ssh -l \"fakeuser auid=1234 tty=pty1 host=127.0.0.1\" victim causes: type=USER_AUTH msg=audit(06/07/2007 11:04:14.429:101) : user pid=8151 uid=root auid=unset subj=system_u:system_r:sshd_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 msg='PAM: authentication acct=fakeuser auid=unknown(1234) tty=pty1 host=127.0.0.1 : exe=/usr/sbin/sshd (hostname=discovery.redhat.com, addr=192.168.1.171, terminal=ssh res=failed)'",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in how account names were written to the audit subsystem by PAM and OpenSSH. Specifically, when a user attempted to login via ssh with a crafted username, audit logs could contain misleading data, such as fake usernames, user ids, tty and host. The injected data could potentially be used to mislead or confuse tools that parse the audit logs.",
    "impact": "The primary impact is the ability to inject false or misleading information into audit logs. This could cause security monitoring tools (IDS/IPS) to generate incorrect alerts or be less reliable. It could also lead to misidentification of attackers or potentially to denial of service if users or systems rely on incorrect data for security countermeasures.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through SSH.  An attacker can use the ssh client to connect to a server specifying a crafted username string with specially injected strings like  auid=, tty=, hostname=.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to initiate an SSH connection to the target system. They do not need to have valid credentials, as this vulnerability is triggered during failed logins.",
        "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data, specifically usernames, that are written into audit logs during failed login attempts in PAM and OpenSSH. The audit subsystem itself doesn't validate the format of this data."
