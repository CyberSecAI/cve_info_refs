The content discusses multiple potential XSS vulnerabilities in PHPIDS, a web application security tool, and provides examples of how to bypass its filters. While the original context is about PHPIDS, several of the issues discussed are related to general XSS prevention and not specific to a single CVE, however some of these issues may apply to a variety of web applications..

Here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**1. Internet Explorer Quirks with "script:" prefixes:**

*   **Root Cause:** Internet Explorer interprets variations of `script:` prefixes (e.g., `??script:`, `???script:`, `????script:`) differently, translating them to `vbscript:` or `javascript:`.
*   **Weakness:** Allows attackers to bypass basic filters looking for `javascript:` or `vbscript:` by using the alternative prefixes
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript or VBScript code in the user's browser.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting crafted URLs containing the modified script prefixes.
*   **Attacker Capability:** Requires the ability to control or influence URL parameters or user-supplied inputs that are used in a way that is vulnerable to XSS

**2. Unfiltered `document.location.search` and `document.referrer`:**

*   **Root Cause:** PHPIDS does not filter the `document.location.search` and `document.referrer` properties.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of filtering for these properties allows injection of malicious code through URL parameters or referrer headers.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution through injected code within the URL or referrer.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafted URLs with malicious code in the query string (e.g., `http://site.com/?<malicious_code>`) or through an attacker-controlled referrer (e.g. redirect to vulnerable site via `http://www.attacker.com/red.php?code-here()`).
*   **Attacker Capability:** Needs ability to control or influence the `document.location.search` and `document.referrer` values.

**3. Bypassing `location.hash` Substring/Replace Rule:**

*   **Root Cause:** The regular expression rule `(?:(?:location)?[. ]\*hash[. ]\*(?:substr(?:ing)?|replace)\s?\()` can be bypassed.
*   **Weakness:** Attackers can bypass the rule using methods like `document.location.hash.split(document.location.hash.charAt(0)).join()` or `document.location.hash[String().substr.toString().substr(9,6)](1)`.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary JavaScript code execution by injecting malicious code in the URL hash.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Injecting crafted URLs that bypass the filtering rule using the above methods
*    **Attacker Capability:** Ability to control the URL hash

**4. Bypassing Function/Method Detection Rules:**

*   **Root Cause:** The filter for common JavaScript functions (`alert`, `prompt`, `confirm`, etc.) can be bypassed.
*   **Weakness:** Attackers can bypass the rule using techniques like `window[eval.toString().substr(9,4)](--code_here--)` or `Function(--code_here--)();`
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary Javascript execution.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Injecting code with the bypass methods.
*   **Attacker Capability:** Ability to inject javascript that is interpreted by the vulnerable application.

**5. Attribute Injection using Malformed Input:**

*   **Root Cause:**  Incorrect parsing or sanitization of input strings containing mixed quotes (`'"`).
*   **Weakness:** Attackers can insert arbitrary attributes into HTML tags by injecting strings like `x' y" z" awesome"whatever='something'`.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary JavaScript execution if `onerror` or `style` attributes are used or other vulnerabilities are present..
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malformed strings through input fields or URL parameters.
*   **Attacker Capability:** Ability to inject specially crafted strings.

**6. Unfiltered Use of "with" Statement:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `with` statement is not filtered.
*   **Weakness:**  Allows injection of code using the `with(document)location.href=cookie;` pattern.
*  **Impact:**  Potentially redirection or manipulation of document properties.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting `with` statements into vulnerable areas.
*   **Attacker Capability:** Ability to inject code that will be parsed by the vulnerable application.

**7. Newline Character Handling Flaws:**
    * **Root Cause:** Error in handling newlines when processing javascript code.
    * **Weakness:** Allows code to be obfuscated and bypass filters through the use of new lines to break up a dangerous function call, for example when concatenating strings
    * **Impact:** Allows for the execution of arbitrary javascript after circumventing previous sanitization efforts.
    * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code that uses new line characters to bypass sanitization.
    * **Attacker Capability:** Ability to inject strings and javascript into the application.
