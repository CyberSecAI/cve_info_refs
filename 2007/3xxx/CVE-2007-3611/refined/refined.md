```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The VRNews application does not properly restrict access to the admin.php file.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Authentication bypass / Credentials Bypass (AB/CB), Insecure Permissions
- Impact of exploitation: Unauthorised access to the admin panel, allowing an attacker to perform administrative tasks such as editing, adding, configuring, or deleting content on the website.
- Attack vectors: By directly accessing the admin.php file with specific 'act' parameters via HTTP GET requests.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: No authentication is required. An attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
