| Release notes for IMail Server 2006.21 (v9.21)  Ipswitch, Inc. <http://www.ipswitch.com>  Copyright 2007   ---   **Highlights of What's New in IMail Server 2006.21**  • **Features and Defect Fixes:**  For a list of added features and defect fixes, see [2006.21 Release Notes](#NewRelease).  • **Web Client -** CuteEditor by CuteSoft Components, Inc., a new HTML editor has replaced FreeTextBox for composing messages.  • **New release of Premium Antispam (Mail-Filters):** IMail Server 2006.21 also includes an update to the Premium Antispam (Mail-Filters) software. The latest version of the StarEngineService provides new options for configuring spam filtering of message header content. These options are available on the Premium Filter Settings page. (Click Services > Antispam.)  **Note**: These settings apply to the selected domain.   * **Flag missing Subject: header as spam**. Checks that the Subject Header field exists. If the Subject is missing, it will take the action specified in **For email determined to be from a dirty IP**  section of the Premium Antispam Filter page. * **Flag missing From: and To: headers as spam**. Checks that both the From and To fields in the header exists. If either field is missing, it will take the action specified in the **For email determined to be from a dirty IP** section of the Premium Antispam Filter page.   These options help to filter emails sent as part of a campaign and to identify IP addresses used to send spam, also known as "dirty" IP addresses. When mail fails the header checks, IMail takes the action specified on the Premium Filter Settings page (click Antispam > Premium Filter).  Also on the Premium Filter Settings page, in the Update Engine Options section, the Enable Telemetry option was added.  **Note:** The Enable Telemetry option will send data from your server to Mail-Filters. This data will help increase the spam detection provided by Mail-Filters. By default, the option is disabled.   * Enable Telemetry. If enabled, sends aggregate data compiled by the Premium Antispam filter to Mail-Filters. Mail Filters uses the data to provide increased spam detection by detecting spam campaigns.   Mail-Filters describes the Telemetry feature as follows: To better fight spam, Mail-Filters would like to collect certain information that will help us to identify spammers and where they are sending messages from. This feature must be turned on for the reputation authority features to work and will enhance catch rate. It can be turned off. The telemetry information is collected as aggregated totals and are not used to identify individual mail messages, but to show traffic flow and trends. An example of the information we might gather is as follows:   * What Mail-Filters Bullet Signatures are tagging messages and how many messages are being tagged. * Where messages are being sent from. * How many messages are being received by aggregate totals of each category - Spam, Good Mail, mail messages sent from a known spammer IP address, or not scanned or if and error occurred on scan.   **Note**: No Message specific information is gathered or sent to Mail-Filters.  Telemetry information is an important tool in helping the fight against spam and will help your catch rate. It is transmitted to Mail-Filters via the standard update process. If telemetry is turned on, then the information is sent to Mail-Filters along with a request for an update.  In the For email determined to be from a dirty IP section, set one of the following options:   * Take the same action as spam. Uses the action specified in the Action to be taken for email identified as spam section. * Take the following action:   + Delete. Immediately deletes the message.   + Forward to Address. Forwards the message to an email address. Enter an email address in the text box to the right of this option. By default, messages are sent to the root address and stored in a mailbox called "root-bulk".   + Insert X- Header (default). Inserts an X- Header into the message indicating that the message was determined to be from a dirty IP address by the premium filter.   + Move to Mailbox. Moves the message to the user’s mailbox specified in the text box to the right of this option. If the mailbox does not exist, it is created. The default mailbox is "bulk".   + None. No action is performed on messages determined to be from a dirty IP address. * Prefix subject with (cleared by default). If selected, messages determined to be from a dirty IP address are modified to begin the message subject with the text entered in the text box to the right of this option. This field is limited to 255 characters.      Tip: We recommend that you select the Insert X- Header option instead of Delete until you know that the antispam options are setup to best suit your filtering requirements.   **Highlights of What's New in IMail Server 2006.2**   * Installs - Online and offline activation and registration are now included in the installation. * Installs - Option available to not reset permissions on repair * Web Mail message and folder lists have been redesigned for better performance and usability.   + Web Mail Move/Copy folder now stays open for multiple moves or copies.   + The Add Contacts grid for the Compose page redesigned for better performance.   + New visible progress indicator displays when sending messages.   + Web Mail now supports persistance for message list column and window sizes. * Web Mail: Compose page now autofills TO/CC/BCC in new messages. * Web Mail: there is a new file called favicon.ico (the Ipswitch icon) in the root of the Web client that is used for browser bookmarking. After you open Web Mail, if you click Add a Favorite in your browser, it will create a bookmark called "Ipswitch Web Messaging" with the Ipswitch IMail icon displayed to its left. * Administrator: Activation status and/or duration of trial mode now display on the interface. * Administrator: Now includes an "About" box that displays product name, version number, and license key.   Known Issue  Safari: Web Client - When replying/forwarding HTML messages, all encoding/HTML tags in original message are displayed.

IMail Server includes powerful antispam and antivirus management tools, a new Web-based administrator and client, and implements a series of programs that run as services including:  • Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) service for sending and receiving mail over the Internet or in an internal TCP/IP network.  • Post Office Protocol, version 3 (POP3) service to allow POP3 clients (such as Microsoft Outlook and Qualcomm Eudora) to download mail from the IMail Server.  • Internet Message Access Protocol, version 4 (IMAP4) service to allow IMAP4 clients (such as Microsoft Outlook and Qualcomm Eudora) to access mail on the IMail Server.  • Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Version 2.1.22 service for publishing user information in an LDAP directory.  • Language support: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Japanese.  IMail also provides features such as a List server for creating and managing mailing lists and a mail to pager/beeper feature that lets you set up aliases on the IMail Server that forward mail from a mail client to preconfigured pager or beeper address.  IMail Server 2006 Features   • **Web Messaging** (Web mail client) lets you send and receive mail using a web browser. You can log on to the Web Messaging from a browser on any computer with a supported browser and manage email without installing email client software. When a user creates a mailbox in the Web client, the mailbox is created on the mail server and mail folders and messages reside on the server.  • **IMail Web Administration** (server) provides local or remote access to IMail Server administration features via a Web browser. You can administer all email functions, including users, groups, services, shared calendars and contacts, and anti-spam and antivirus settings.   + If WorkgroupShare is implemented in current IMail or ICS version, Microsoft® Outlook contacts are able to transfer and sync with IMail Web Messaging.   **IMail Web Messaging, Web Administration, and Instant Messaging supports**:   + Microsoft® Internet Explorer 5.5 or later+ Mozilla 1.7 or later+ Firefox 1.0.6 or later (for Microsoft Windows)+ Firefox 2.0.0.2 or later (for Macintosh)+ Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 and later+ Microsoft® .NET Framework 2.0+ Safari 2.0.4 for Macintosh, or, the upgraded version of Safari included with Mac OS X version 10.4.8   System Requirements   | **Required Hardware** | **For best results** |  | | --- | --- | --- | | An Intel Pentium® 4, 1 GHz or higher or an equivalent processor | ·      Pentium 4, 3+ GHz  ·      For high mail traffic, use multiple processors |  | | 512 MB RAM minimum | ·     1+ GB of RAM |  | | TCP/IP enabled network interface card (NIC) with a **static** IP address if !supportLineBreakNewLine  endif |  |  | | A broadband or dial-up connection to the Internet |  |  | | For mail-to-pager and IMonitor notifications, a modem and phone line are required |  |  | | **Required Software** | **For best results** | **Where to get it if you don't have it** | | Microsoft® Windows 2000 Server or Microsoft Windows 2003 Server    if !supportLineBreakNewLine | Apply latest service packs  Use NTFS file system (not FAT)  **Do not deploy IMail on a Windows 2000 Domain Controller in an Active Directory environment.** | For service packs: [www.windowsupdate.com](http://www.windowsupdate.com/)    Advice on NTFS vs FAT: <http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windowsnt/4/workstation/reskit/en-us/file_sys.mspx> | | Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 | via Windows Update | <http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=en> | | Windows Script 5.6 (part of Microsoft Internet Explorer 6) |  | <http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx> | | Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) | ·     Version 5.0 or higher | <http://www.microsoft.com/WindowsServer2003/iis/default.mspx> | | Microsoft Data Access Component (MDAC) 2.6 or later |  | <http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/mdac/downloads/default.aspx> |   Optional Enhancements   • IMail AntiVirus Premium (available separately)  IMail AntiVirus Premium is fully integrated with IMail Server and is powered by Symantec ScanEngine Server, a high performance, scalable, reliable solution to protect against viruses. • IMail AntiVirus (available separately) AntiVirus for IMail fully integrates with IMail Server and is powered by state of the art anti-virus technology developed by SOFTWIN BitDefender • IMail Server Plus 2006.21 Provides standard IMail configuration with Premium Antispam filtering.  • IMail Server Premium 2006.21  Provides standard IMail configuration with Premium Antispam filtering and Instant Messaging  Installing/Upgrading/Repairs  Ipswitch IMail uses InstallShield® Wizard to install the IMail components on your computer.

Click the .exe install file.  2. On the installation screen, select the components you want to install, then click **Install**. IMail or ICS installs each selected component. Follow the on-screen instructions.  **Important**:  • If Microsoft .NET is installed, but not configured to work with IIS, run the following command: x:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet\_regiis.exe -i -enable (where x: is the appropriate drive letter).  • If your mail domain is using an external user database, then you must set user permissions for the external database for it to function correctly in IMail. • When you configure a DSN to an SQL data source in the Microsoft Windows ODBC Data Source Administrator, it may default to **Named Pipes** network library. Make sure that you set the connection type to **TCP/IP** in order for the external database to work correctly. • If you are currently using an external user database with an earlier (pre-v7.0) version of IMail, you must add a new set of required columns to the database table in which user information is stored. Please refer to the "External Database Changes" entry in the Release Notes section of this document for details. • If you are upgrading from IMail Server prior to version 8.1, an LDAP database conversion occurs during installation. The conversion can take a lengthy amount of time depending on the number of domains to convert. If the LDAP data is not available after the upgrade, run the LDAP Convert utility to correct the issue. In the command line utility, type: ldaper /CONVERT /Y For more information, see the IMail Administrator Help. • If you select an install directory other than the default install directory, make sure that the IIS IUSR\_<computer name> user has Administrative access to that install directory. For more information, see the [Folder Rights](#FolderRights) section.  Using IIS Virtual Directories  IMail Administrator and IMail Web Messaging (Web client) use Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) virtual directories to identify where the administrator and client Web files are located. By default, the installation program Install the admin files in the IAdmin virtual directory and the client files in the IClient virtual directory.   Changing IIS Virtual Directory names  If you want to change the IMail Administrator virtual directory, you need to change the following registry key entries to the new virtual directory name that you changed in the IIS Console:  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Global\WebRoot HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\Messenger Server\Settings\WebRoot   If you want to change the IMail Web Messaging virtual directory, no registry key change is required.  See the [IIS help](http://127.0.0.1/iishelp/iis/misc/default.asp) for additional information about renaming virtual directories.  Checking the Registry  **Regcheck.exe** is run automatically during a repair or upgrade, and can also be run from the command line.  Regcheck troubleshoots registry conflicts during upgrades and repairs.   + **Basic Command Syntax**: regcheck  | Message | Example | Translation | | --- | --- | --- | | Missing primary domain %Official Host Name% | Missing primary domain imail.ipswitch.com | The hostname defined in the 'HostName' value under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Global*  does not match a key in *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains.* | | Primary Host %Official Host Name% address is %IP Address% | Primary Host imail.ipswitch.com address is 192.168.1.1 | This tells you the Primary Domain defined by the 'HostName' value under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Global*  and its IP defined by the 'Address' value under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%OfficialHostName%.* | | Could not find address for primary host %Official Host Name% | Could not find address for primary host imail.ipswitch.com | The 'Address' value under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%OfficialHostName%* does not exist. | | Could not find Global HostName, host key check failed | Could not find Global HostName, host key check failed | The 'HostName' value under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Global*  does not exist. | | Could not find IMail Global key, host key check failed | Could not find IMail Global key, host key check failed | The Global key under the *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail*  does not exist. | | Could not find IMail Domains key, domain registry check failed | Could not find IMail Domains key, domain registry check failed | The Domains key under the *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail*  does not exist. | | Dup Official %Official Host Name% Official %IP Address% and %IP Address% | Dup Official imail.ipswitch.com Official 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2 | There are multiple Address keys under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains*  that contain the same 'Official' value under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%IP Address%.* | | Domain / official mismatch: official - %Official Host Name% Address - %IP Address% | Domain / official mismatch: official - imail.ipswitch.com Address - 192.168.1.1 | The 'Address' value under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%OfficialHostName%*  is %IP Address%, but other Address keys under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains* contain the same 'Official' value under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%IP Address%.* | | Domain / official mismatch: missing address key in domain %Official Host Name% | Domain / official mismatch: missing address key in domain imail.ipswitch.com | The 'Address' value under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%Official Host Name%*  does not exist. | | Address %IP Address% Official key %Official Host Name% domain does not exist | Address 192.168.1.3 Official key mail3.ipswitch.com domain does not exist | *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%IP Address%* contains an 'Official' value of %Official Host Name% that does not contain a key under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains.* | | Dup Address %IP Address% Domain %Official Host Name% and %Official Host Name% | Dup Address 192.168.1.1 Domain imail.ipswitch.com and mail2.ipswitch.com | The Address value for *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%Official Host Name%*  and *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%Official Host Name%* are the same. | | Dup TopDir Domain %Official Host Name% and domain %Official Host Name% | Dup TopDir Domain imail.ipswitch.com and domain mail2.ipswitch.com | The 'TopDir' value for *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%Official Host Name%*  and *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%Official Host Name%* are the same. | | Domain entry %Official Host Name% has no IP entry | Domain entry mail4.ipswitch.com has no IP entry | The 'Address' value under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%Official Host Name%* references an address that does not contain a key under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains.* | | Domain IP / system IP mismatch - %Official Host Name% Address - %IP Address% | Domain IP / system IP mismatch - mail4.ipswitch.com Address- 10.10.10.1 | The 'Address' value under *HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Domains\%Official Host Name%* references an address that is not bound to the NIC. | | System IP found - %IP Address% | System IP found - 192.168.1.4 | The IP that is bound to the NIC. |   Uninstalling  1.

To remove these, you must delete them manually. • Everything is deleted in the Windows registry under HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\Software\Ipswitch\IMail (but the Ipswitch key is not removed). • Directories and files created by setup.exe are removed if they have not been modified. For example, if you have not added any users (and root never gets mail), the Users directory is removed. If these directories have been modified (i.e. the root or users accounts have received mail),you must remove them manually.  Downgrading  You can downgrade the IMail Server 2006.21 back to a previous version of 2006 or ICS 2.02 or earlier, without uninstalling as follows:  1. Open the Registry Editor and locate the following key:  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{42A05E51-7514-4330-A784-B4C45412F04D}  2. Change the Version value to 2000000 (hex)  3. Launch the installation file and proceed as normal.  4. When asked if you would like to convert your LDAP database, select no.  **Note**: The IAdmin and IClient virtual directories and web files will still be on the computer.  Important: Mailbox sizes are corrupted after downgrading IMail 2006 to an earlier version (IMail 8.x). If you have quotas set up, they will fail. To correct this, delete the .uid and .xml files.  Important: When downgrading IMail Server 2006.21 to a previous IMail Server version, you need to delete the configuration.xml file from the top-level IMail folder.  Starting the Web Admin and the Web Client  After installation, you have the option to launch the IMail Web Admin automatically. If you choose not to launch IMail Web Admin automatically, in your browser address box, type the IP address or domain name of the IMail Web Server followed by the path where you installed IMail Server Web Admin.  For example: http://mail.domain.com/IAdmin, then press ENTER. The Ipswitch Web Admin login page appears.  -OR-  Click **Start** > **Programs** > **Ipswitch IMail Server** > **IMail Server > IMail Server Administration**. The Ipswitch Web Admin login page appears.  To launch the Web Client, in your browser address box, type the IP address or domain name of the IMail Web Server followed by the path where you installed IMail Server Web Client.  For example: http://mail.domain.com/IClient, then press ENTER. The Ipswitch Web Client login page appears.   ---   Changing the Web Client Default Directory (setting a redirect for Web Messaging)  To set a redirect so Web Messaging users do not have to use \IClient in the URL for Web Messaging:  1. Click **Start** > **Programs** > **Administrative Tools** > **Internet Information Services**. The IIS console opens.  2. Right-click IClient (usually located under **Web Site** > **Default Web Site**).  3. Select **Properties**. The **IClient Properties** dialog box opens.  4. In the **Execute Permissions** list, click **Scripts only**.  5. Copy the directory path in the **Local Path** box.  6. Click **OK**.  7. Right-click **Default Web Site**.  8. Select **Properties**. The **Default Web Site Properties** dialog box opens.  9. Click the **Home Directory** tab.  10. Paste the directory path you copied from the IClient dialog box **Local Path** box into the **Default Web Site Properties** dialog box **Local Path** box.  Web Messaging Notes for Upgraders The Web Messaging templates have been redesigned and no longer support the Web template infrastructure implemented in previous versions of Web Messaging (included in IMail 8.2 and earlier). When you upgrade to IMail v9.0/ICS 2006 or later, the previous versions of the Web templates are not functional.  Web Calendaring Notes for Upgraders  There were no updates to the Web Calendaring templates in this release.  The Web Address for IMail Web Calendaring: By default, the IMail Web Calendaring server is assigned a Web address that consists of the domain name of the IMail Server and a Web server port number. The default port number is 8484. For example, if your mail host has a name of host1.ipswitch.com, then the address is: http://host1.ipswitch.com:8484  IMail users can start IMail Web Calendaring by entering the address in the browser’s address field. If you are not running another Web server on the same host, you can set the port number to the normal HTTP (Web) server port of 80. In this case, users do not have to specify the port with the Web address. For example, users enter: http://host1.ipswitch.com.  **Important**: Some firewalls may block the 8484 port, in which case you need to change the port number.  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Notes  The private key file is protected using a password specified in SSL Configuration Utility. This password is required for decoding the key file while loading the SSL server. This password is stored in the registry and automatically retrieved during the loading process of SSL Server. The registry path for IMail is usually SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\imail\ssl. The registry path must be correct; otherwise an error message is generated and the files will not be created.   ---   Release Notes 2006.21  Vulnerabilities  Ipswitch would like to thank TippingPoint ([www.tippingpoint.com](http://www.tippingpoint.com)) and **Zero Day Initiative** ([www.zerodayinitiative.com](http://www.zerodayintiative.com)) for reporting the following issues that have been fixed:   + A heap overflow condition in Imailsec allowed unauthenticated users arbitrary code execution. + Buffer overflow due to unchecked buffer length in subscribe.

Enabling this feature will improve performance when using an external database. This can be enabled by creating and setting two registry keys:  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Global\UseMultiConnect HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Ipswitch\IMail\Global\MaxConnect  The first key, UseMultiConnect should be set to 1 to enable multiple database connections. The second key, MaxConnect should be set to the maximum number of connections allowed; 10 is recommended.  When installing IMail v8.2 or later over any version earlier than 7.1 in which one or more hosts are configured to use an external user database, new columns must be added to the database tables. This is due to additional user-level data which must be stored for use with the new Web Messaging features and for Web Calendaring. These new columns must be added to the user table for each IMail host configured to use an external database.  **Notes**:  If a custom ODBC driver was used with an earlier version of IMail, the driver must be modified to accommodate the new columns. Source code for the basic ODBCUser.dll driver (tailored for SQL Server and Access) may be obtained by download from the IMail Support Center:  ftp://ftp.ipswitch.com/Ipswitch/Product\_Support/IMail/odbcuser.dll  These database column additions must be made before installing IMail v8.2. Also, if a custom ODBC database driver will be used with IMail, it must be created and ready for use. New columns and their types are as follows:  IMail Server 2006.1 New Columns   | Database Column Name | Type | Default Value | | --- | --- | --- | | ENABLEALTWGSID | INTEGER | 0 | | ALTWGSID | VARCHAR | 255 |  ---   IMail Server v7.1 New Columns   | Database Column Name | Type | Default Value | | --- | --- | --- | | NUMNOTIFY | INTEGER | 0 | | LASTNOTIFY | INTEGER | 0 |  ---   IMail Server v7.0 New Columns   | Database Column Name | Type | Default Value | | --- | --- | --- | | NUMTRIES | INTEGER | 0 | | LASTNOTIFY | INTEGER | 0 | | ATTEMPTTIME | INTEGER | 0 | | NUMTIMESSUSP | INTEGER | 0 | | SPNDUSRACCT | INTEGER | 0 | | IWOPTIONS | INTEGER | 0 | | SPELLCHKG | INTEGER | 0 | | ICALENBL | INTEGER | -1 | | SPELLENBL | INTEGER | -1 | | NUMSGSTNS | INTEGER | -1 | | IWDEPTH | INTEGER | -1 | | PRVWSIZE | INTEGER | -1 | | STRTDAY | INTEGER | -1 | | ENTRYGRNL | INTEGER | -1 | | STARTTIME | INTEGER | -1 | | ENDTIME | INTEGER | -1 | | MAXEVNTDISP | INTEGER | -1 | | MAXTSKDISP | INTEGER | -1 | | MAXNOTEDISP | INTEGER | -1 | | MAXDLYRCURCNT | INTEGER | -1 | | MAXWKLYRCURCNT | INTEGER | -1 | | MAXMONRCURCNT | INTEGER | -1 | | MAXYRLYRCURCNT | INTEGER | -1 | | DISPCMPLTDTSKS | INTEGER | -1 | | HOURSCLOCK | INTEGER | -1 | | MAXSRCHRESPPG | INTEGER | -1 | | MAXEVENTTITLELEN | INTEGER | -1 | | MAXTASKTITLELEN | INTEGER | -1 | | CONFIRMONDELETE | INTEGER | -1 | | TIMEZONE | VARCHAR(255) | "" (empty string) | | DEFVIEW | VARCHAR(40) | "" (empty string) | | DEFCALNM | VARCHAR(40) | "" (empty string) |   For all existing user records, these columns should be set to the default values shown in the table above.  Please note that when all domains use the IMail and/or NT user databases, these changes do not apply. Also, when creating a new external database, these columns will be automatically generated as the table is created.   ---   For more information   You can download User Guides and view other information on the Ipswitch Collaboration Suite Support Center at [http://www.ipswitch.com/support/imail/index.asp](http://visit.ipswitch.com/ICSSptCtr)  **Note**: You need Adobe Acrobat Reader to view .PDF files.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
