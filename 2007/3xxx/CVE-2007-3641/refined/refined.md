{
  "CVE-2007-3641": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from miscalculation of the buffer length when processing malformed PAX extension headers in the libarchive library.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow due to improper length calculation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service (crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted PAX or TAR archives with malformed PAX extension headers.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a user or system a specially crafted archive to process"
  },
    "CVE-2007-3644": {
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to an infinite loop when processing PAX extension headers due to an end-of-file condition or malformed headers within PAX or TAR archives.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Infinite loop due to incorrect parsing logic"
        ],
        "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service by making libarchive enter an infinite loop.",
        "Attack vectors": "Crafted PAX or TAR archives with malformed PAX extension headers or premature end-of-file conditions.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a user or system a specially crafted archive to process"
      },
   "CVE-2007-3645": {
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs due to a NULL pointer dereference when processing a TAR header immediately following a PAX extension header where there's an end-of-file condition or a malformed PAX header.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "NULL pointer dereference due to improper header handling"
        ],
        "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (crash) by triggering a NULL pointer dereference.",
        "Attack vectors": "Crafted PAX or TAR archives with malformed PAX extension headers or premature end-of-file conditions within a TAR header following the PAX header.",
          "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a user or system a specially crafted archive to process"
