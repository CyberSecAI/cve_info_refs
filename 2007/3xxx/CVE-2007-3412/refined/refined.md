The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in ClickGallery Server versions 5.1 and earlier: SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**1. SQL Injection:**
*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of the `image_id` parameter in the `edit_image.asp` file before being used in a SQL query.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization, allowing the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote exploitation through the `edit_image.asp` file via the `image_id` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
*   **Root Cause:**  Improper sanitization of the `from` parameter in the `edit_image.asp` file before being returned to the user.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of output encoding allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML and script code.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in the context of the affected site, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or defacement.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote exploitation through the `edit_image.asp` file via the `from` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, often achieved by tricking a user to click a malicious link.

The content provides more specific details than the typical CVE description, detailing the vulnerable parameters (`image_id` and `from`) and the affected file (`edit_image.asp`).
