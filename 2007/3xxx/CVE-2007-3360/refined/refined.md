CVE-2007-3360: BitchX 1.1-final - 'EXEC' Remote Command Execution
```

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Remote Command Execution
*   **Affected Software:** BitchX IRC client (versions 1.1-final and possibly others)
*   **Root Cause:** Unchecked bounds in a hash table within the `hook.c` file. This allows injection of data structures, leading to remote command execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious server can send specially crafted data to a vulnerable BitchX client. When the client connects to the server, the injected data structures cause arbitrary commands to be executed on the client's system.
*   **Exploitability:** Exploit code is available.
*   **Impact:** Remote execution of arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. In the provided example, the `ps -aux` command is executed on the client.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to control a malicious IRC server that the victim connects to.
*   **Slackware's Response:** Slackware removed BitchX from their distribution due to unresolved security issues.
