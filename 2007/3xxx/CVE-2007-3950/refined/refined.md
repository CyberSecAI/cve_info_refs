Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the usage of an incorrect format specifier in lighttpd when logging errors, specifically affecting 32-bit platforms where the size of `off_t` (typically used for file offsets) differs from the size of `int`. This occurs within the modules `mod_webdav`, `mod_fastcgi`, and `mod_scgi`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect format specifier:** The `log_error_write` function in `log.c` used the format specifier `%d` (for `int`) where it should have used `%ld` (for `long int`) when logging `off_t` values.
*   **Type Mismatch:** The use of `%d` instead of `%ld` caused the `strlen` function to attempt to read an address that wasn't valid, resulting in a crash.
*   **Memory corruption:** The incorrect formatting during the logging operation leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability causing the webserver to crash. This effectively makes the server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by interacting with the lighttpd webserver through modules mod\_webdav, mod\_fastcgi, or mod\_scgi, which use the logging mechanism.
*  Specifically, closing the SCGI socket from the backend during an active request triggers the bug.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending specially crafted requests that involve the affected modules or triggering conditions like closing a SCGI connection from the backend.
*   **Target 32-bit Platform:** The vulnerability specifically impacts 32-bit platforms.

**Additional details:**
*   The issue was identified in version 1.4.15 and fixed in version 1.4.16 by correcting the format specifier.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a type mismatch issue when logging error messages, specifically affecting the usage of the `off_t` data type on 32-bit systems in certain lighttpd modules. An attacker can trigger a crash in the lighttpd webserver, causing a DoS.
