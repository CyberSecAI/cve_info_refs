Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discovered in Safari:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The blog post mentions multiple bugs found through fuzzing, including DoS and remote code execution. Specific root causes for each vulnerability are not detailed in this post, but it is implied that there are memory corruption issues and null pointer dereferences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption
- Null pointer dereference
- Multiple DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerabilities
- Multiple Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The browser can crash or become unresponsive.
- Remote Code Execution: Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Fuzzing: Using automated tools to send malformed or unexpected input.
- Importing bookmarks: A specific user comment indicates that importing bookmarks crashed the browser.
- Visiting specific links: Another user comment indicates that visiting specific links crashed the browser.
- Other unspecified methods discovered via fuzzing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted inputs or have the victim interact with the browser through crafted bookmarks or web pages.
- The blog post highlights the lack of security features in OSX as a factor making exploitation reliable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerabilities were found in both the beta version of Safari for Windows and the production version on OSX.
- The author explicitly states that the bugs are present in the production copy of Safari on OSX.
- It is mentioned that the lack of advanced security features in OSX contributes to the exploit's reliability.
- One of the remote code execution bugs is described as "weaponized", implying that it is easily exploitable, unlike the other RCE bug.
- The blog post mentions that 6 bugs were discovered, 4 DoS, and 2 RCE bugs.
- Several comments indicate users experienced crashes while using Safari, further confirming the unstable nature of the browser.
- It appears a variety of different methods were used to cause crashes and that there were multiple vulnerabilities discovered by different people.
