```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by the possibility of creating loops of references to external templates within JWIG, which leads to a denial-of-service condition
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability is related to uncontrolled recursion or looping when external templates are referenced.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can cause a denial of service (service degradation) by exploiting the vulnerability.
  - Attack vectors: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by creating loops of references to external templates, leading to a denial-of-service.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have some level of control over the template references or be able to influence the context in which templates are called
