Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient privilege validation in the `CREATE TABLE LIKE` statement within MySQL. Specifically, when a user attempts to create a new table using the `CREATE TABLE LIKE source_table` command, MySQL fails to properly check if the user has the necessary privileges to access the structure of the `source_table`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Privilege Checks:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks on the source table during a `CREATE TABLE LIKE` operation.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This flaw allows a user without `SELECT` privileges on a table to indirectly access its structure through a newly created table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:**  An attacker could exploit this to bypass normal access control mechanisms and learn the structure (column names, data types, etc.) of tables they are not supposed to view.
*   **Circumvention of Privilege Checks:** The vulnerability allows attackers to get around the intended privilege checks in `SHOW CREATE TABLE` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection**: Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability could potentially be exploited by an attacker with the ability to execute arbitrary SQL commands to a vulnerable MySQL server, but the content provided focuses on the insufficient privilege checks and how to reproduce the vulnerability using normal sql commands

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated MySQL user.
*   **Database Access:** The attacker must have the ability to connect to the database and execute SQL queries.
*   **No `SELECT` privilege on the source table:** The user needs to lack the explicit select privilege on the table they want to copy.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report from bugs.mysql.com provides a detailed scenario demonstrating the vulnerability and includes a fix involving locking the source table during the `CREATE TABLE LIKE` process.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200708-10) and Debian Security Advisory (DSA 1451-1) confirm that the vulnerability was fixed in MySQL versions 5.0.44 and later.
*   The fix was included in MySQL 5.0.44, 5.1.20-beta, and later, according to bug reports.
*   The Slackware Security Advisory (SSA:2007-348-01) also mentions this vulnerability as part of the updates.
*   The fix was achieved by keeping the source table open during the entire operation and placing the copying of the .frm file, the call to ha_create_table(), and writing to binlog into one critical section protected by LOCK_open mutex.
