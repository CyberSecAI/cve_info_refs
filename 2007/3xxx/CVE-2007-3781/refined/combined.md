Description:
CREATE TABLE LIKE does not require any privileges on source table.

Altough documentation does not say explicitly that it should require any privileges on source table this IMO still should be considered as a bug,
as such behavior allows to circumvent privilege checks in SHOW CREATE TABLE/I_S tables.

How to repeat:
# Here is the script for MySQL's test suite which demonstrates problem
create database mysqltest;
use mysqltest;
create table t1 (i int);
# Connect as anonymous user (which has rights on 'test' database)
connect (user1,localhost,,,);
connection user1;
use test;
# As expected error is emitted
--error 1044
show create table mysqltest.t1;
create table t1 like mysqltest.t1;
# Oops... we have circumvented privilege check...
show create table t1;
```

be pushed to the relevant source trees for release in the next
version. You can access the patch from:

  <http://lists.mysql.com/commits/19127>

ChangeSet@1.2379, 2007-02-01 00:05:29+03:00, dlenev@mockturtle.local +14 -0
  Tentative fix for bugs #18950 "create table like does not obtain
  LOCK_open", #23667 "CREATE TABLE LIKE is not isolated from alteration
  by other connections" and [bug #25578](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=25578) "CREATE TABLE LIKE does not
  require any privileges on source table".

  Concurrent execution of CREATE TABLE LIKE statement and DDL statements
  on source table or DML/DDL statements on its target table could result
  in various errors in these statements and wrong order of statements in
  binlog.

  This problems was caused by incomplete protection/table-locking against
  concurrent statements implemented in mysql_create_like_table() routine.

  This fix simply implements such protection in proper way:

  We keep source table open during whole operation and place copying
  of .frm file, call to ha_create_table() and writing to binlog into
  one critical section protected by LOCK_open mutex. While former
  gives us protection against concurrent DDL on source table; the latter
  protects from DDL and DML on target table.

  It also removes some duplicated code from mysql_create_like_table().

  Questions for reviewers are marked by QQ.

# MySQL: Denial of Service and information leakage — GLSA **200708-10**

A Denial of Service vulnerability and a table structure information leakage
vulnerability were found in MySQL.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/mysql** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **5.0.44** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **5.0.44** |

### Background

MySQL is a popular multi-threaded, multi-user SQL server.

### Description

Dormando reported a vulnerability within the handling of password
packets in the connection protocol (CVE-2007-3780). Andrei Elkin also
found that the "CREATE TABLE LIKE" command didn't require SELECT
privileges on the source table (CVE-2007-3781).

### Impact

A remote unauthenticated attacker could use the first vulnerability to
make the server crash. The second vulnerability can be used by
authenticated users to obtain information on tables they are not
normally able to access.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-5.0.44"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : mysql-dfsg-5.0
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-3781 CVE-2007-5969 CVE-2007-6304

Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL
database server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-3781

    It was discovered that privilege validation for the source table
    of CREATE TABLE LIKE statements was insufficiently enforced, which
    might lead to information disclosure. This is only exploitable by
    authenticated users.

CVE-2007-5969

    It was discovered that symbolic links were handled insecurely during
    the creation of tables with DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY
    statements, which might lead to denial of service by overwriting
    data. This is only exploitable by authenticated users.

CVE-2007-6304

    It was discovered that queries to data in a FEDERATED table can
    lead to a crash of the local database server, if the remote server
    returns information with less columns than expected, resulting in
    denial of service.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.51-1.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch4.

The the old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain mysql-dfsg-5.0.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
