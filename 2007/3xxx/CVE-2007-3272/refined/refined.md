{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a local file inclusion (LFI) in the language parameter of the MiniBB forum registration form.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the language parameter during user registration.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem into the application, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information (e.g., configuration files, source code, password files) or even remote code execution depending on the server configuration and the included file content.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to the registration page (index.php) of the MiniBB forum, manipulating the language parameter to include the path of the desired local file using directory traversal techniques (e.g., ../../../). The crafted POST data includes multipart form data including manipulated language parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server running the vulnerable MiniBB application. No prior authentication is needed as the vulnerability is present during the registration process. The attacker must also be able to identify the vulnerable MiniBB version (2.0.5)."
