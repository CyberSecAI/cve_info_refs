Package        : mysql-dfsg, mysql-dfsg-5.0, mysql-dfsg-4.1
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2583, CVE-2007-2691, CVE-2007-2692
                 CVE-2007-3780, CVE-2007-3782, CVE-2007-5925
Debian Bug     : 426353, 424778, 424778, 451235

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the MySQL database packages
with implications ranging from unauthorized database modifications to
remotely triggered server crashes.

CVE-2007-2583

	The in_decimal::set function in item_cmpfunc.cc in MySQL
	before 5.0.40 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
	denial of service (crash) via a crafted IF clause that results
	in a divide-by-zero error and a NULL pointer dereference.
	(Affects source version 5.0.32)

CVE-2007-2691

	MySQL does not require the DROP privilege for RENAME TABLE
	statements, which allows remote authenticated users to rename
	arbitrary tables. (All supported versions affected.)

CVE-2007-2692

	The mysql_change_db function does not restore THD::db_access
	privileges when returning from SQL SECURITY INVOKER stored
	routines, which allows remote authenticated users to gain
	privileges.  (Affects source version 5.0.32)

CVE-2007-3780

	MySQL could be made to overflow a signed char during
	authentication. Remote attackers could use specially crafted
	authentication requests to cause a denial of
	service. (Upstream source versions 4.1.11a and 5.0.32
	affected.)

CVE-2007-3782

	Phil Anderton discovered that MySQL did not properly verify
	access privileges when accessing external tables. As a result,
	authenticated users could exploit this to obtain UPDATE
	privileges to external tables.  (Affects source version
	5.0.32)

CVE-2007-5925

	The convert_search_mode_to_innobase function in ha_innodb.cc
	in the InnoDB engine in MySQL 5.1.23-BK and earlier allows
	remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service
	(database crash) via a certain CONTAINS operation on an
	indexed column, which triggers an assertion error.  (Affects
	source version 5.0.32)

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch3 of the mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.0.24-10sarge3 of mysql-dfsg and version
4.1.11a-4sarge8 of mysql-dfsg-4.1

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.

Upgrade instructions

Description:
A user only has privileges to update a given column of a table t. By using a view, he is able to update any column of t, although the view is defined with SQL SECURITY INVOKER.

How to repeat:
As root:

GRANT UPDATE (col1) ON t TO 'readonlyuser'@'localhost';
CREATE SQL SECURITY INVOKER VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

As 'readonlyuser':

UPDATE t SET col2='xxx' WHERE (some condition)
ERROR 1143 (42000): UPDATE command denied to user 'readonlyuser'@'localhost' for column 'col2' in table 't'

UPDATE v SET col2='xxx' WHERE (some condition)
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Rows matched: 1  Changed: 0  Warnings: 0
```

Thank you for a problem report. Please, connect as readonlyuser and send the results of:

SHOW GRANTS;

And, as root:

SELECT * from mysql.user where user='readonlyuser'\G

  database.

  If a user has a right to update anything in the current database then the
  access was granted and further checks of access rights for underlying tables
  wasn't done correctly. The check is done before a view is opened and thus no
  check of access rights for underlying tables can be carried out.
  This allows a user to update through a view a table from another database for
  which he hasn't enough rights.

  Now the mysql_update() and the mysql_test_update() functions are forces
  re-checking of the access rights after a view is opened.
