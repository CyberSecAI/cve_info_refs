```
- Root cause of vulnerability: MySQL did not properly verify access privileges when accessing external tables through views.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper access control leading to privilege escalation. Specifically, when a user had UPDATE privileges on a column of a table, they could use a view to gain UPDATE privileges to any column in that table, bypassing the column-level access control.
- Impact of exploitation: Authenticated users could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized UPDATE privileges on external tables, potentially leading to data modification they shouldn't have access to.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited by creating a view and then using that view to update data.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An authenticated database user with some update privileges is required.
