Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3597:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a session fixation issue in the backend administration interface of Zen Cart 1.3.7.
- The application uses a "permissive" session management system, which allows the web browser to specify any session ID, instead of relying on server-generated IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Session Fixation:** The core issue is that an attacker can force a user's session ID to a specific value. The application does not properly validate or regenerate session IDs, making it susceptible to session fixation attacks.
- **Insecure Session Management:** The application does not use secure session management practices, such as regenerating the session ID upon login or accepting only server generated session identifiers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can set a session ID, then wait for a legitimate administrator to log in, and take over their session using the pre-set ID.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By hijacking an administrator's session, an attacker can gain administrative privileges, allowing them to view and modify user records, perform transactions, and potentially compromise the entire system.
- **Complete Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability is rated as having complete impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack can be mounted remotely by manipulating cookies associated with the administrator interface of Zen Cart.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the cookie variable in the user's browser, such as by injecting a specific session ID.
- The attacker does not require local access, only the ability to send manipulated requests to the web application.
- The attack requires a legitimate administrator to log in after the session ID has been fixed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered on 20.06.2007, and a patch was reportedly made available on 02.07.2007, though the provided content doesn't specify the nature of the patch.
- The advisory references two resources which explain session fixation in general:
    - http://www.acrossecurity.com/papers/session\_fixation.pdf
    - http://www.webappsec.org/projects/threat/classes/session\_fixation.shtml

**Mitigation:**
The advisory suggests two workarounds:
- Regenerate the session identifier (SID) on each request. This ensures that a fixed SID becomes invalid when the attacker tries to use it.
- Accept only server-generated SIDs, rejecting any user-provided session IDs.
