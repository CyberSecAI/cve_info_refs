Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3128:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the WSPortal site management system. This occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to:
- Obtain sensitive data from the database.
- Modify the database contents.
- Send anonymous emails to other recipients.
- Acquire administrator privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: The attack can be carried out remotely via HTTP requests.
- Specifically, crafted URL parameters, such as the 'page' parameter in the example, can be manipulated to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WSPortal application.
- The attacker must also know the structure of the database to formulate successful SQL injection queries.
- PHP magic_quotes_gpc must be set to 'Off'.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that the vendor was notified multiple times but did not respond, and there is no official fix available.
*   A workaround is suggested, which involves setting `magic_quotes_gpc = On` in the php.ini configuration.
*   The provided example demonstrates a simple SQL injection attack to extract username and password from the `users` table.
*   The vulnerability is specific to WSPortal version 1.0.
*   The CVSS score is 6.8 with a High risk.
*   The exploit is functional but requires 'High' access complexity and is not authenticated.
