Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3342:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a failure in Movable Type's XSS filter to properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically within blog comments. The filter can be bypassed using malformed HTML input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Movable Type's XSS filter is not robust enough to handle certain types of malformed HTML input.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Theft:** Attackers can potentially steal cookies, which could lead to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Web Page Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of the web pages, potentially injecting malicious content or disrupting the functionality of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Comments:** Attackers can post crafted comments containing malicious HTML or JavaScript through the Movable Type blogging platform.
*   **Malformed HTML:** The vulnerability is triggered by specific patterns of malformed HTML within the user input:
    *   **NULL Byte in Number Entity Reference:** Inserting a null byte within a numerical character reference (e.g., `<A href="javascript&#[0x00]8;alert();">link</A>`).
    *  **Unfinished Tag:** Leaving an HTML tag unfinished at the end of the comment (e.g., `<P><BR style="xss:expression(alert())"`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Comment Posting Ability:** Attackers need the ability to post comments on a vulnerable Movable Type blog, which is typically allowed for blog readers by default.
*   **Knowledge of Exploitation Techniques:** Attackers need to be aware of the specific techniques to evade Movable Type's XSS filter, particularly the use of null bytes and unfinished HTML tags.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is more likely to be triggered in Internet Explorer based on the analysis.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Movable Type version 3.34.
