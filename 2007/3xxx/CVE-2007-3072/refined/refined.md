{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input validation in the handling of 'resource://' URLs, specifically allowing directory traversal using backslashes and escaped forward slashes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Directory traversal vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access local files on the user's system by manipulating the 'resource://' URL, which could lead to information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulating the 'resource://' URL to include backslashes and/or escaped forward slashes to traverse directories."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft or modify the 'resource://' URL, typically by controlling input to the application that handles resource URLs."
  },
  "additional_details": "The initial fix only addressed backslashes and failed to handle escaped forward slashes (e.g., %2F), requiring a subsequent fix. The vulnerability was initially found on Windows but later discovered to be present on other platforms like macOS and Linux with escaped forward slashes. The vulnerability was identified by both internal researchers and external security researchers."
