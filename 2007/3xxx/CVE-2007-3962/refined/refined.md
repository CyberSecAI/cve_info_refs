Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-3962:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by boundary errors in the `fsplib` code used by gFTP when handling overly long directory or file names. This is a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow in `fsplib` when processing directory or file names.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's system.
-  Denial of Service (CVE-2007-3961 is mentioned alongside this) is also possible.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to entice a user to download a file (presumably via FTP) with a specially crafted, overly long directory or file name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker.
- The attacker needs to control the name of the file or directory served via FTP.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves updating the `fsplib` code to version 0.9, which includes security fixes and checks for overly long directory/file names, and the affected package `gftp` needed to be updated to at least `2.0.18-r6` to include these fixes.
- The content also links this to a related CVE, CVE-2007-3961, which also results from the vulnerable `fsplib` code, potentially leading to a denial of service.
