Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3650:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the improper handling of errors and inputs within the myBloggie application, specifically in `calendar.php`, `common.php`, and `login.php`. These scripts generate PHP warnings and errors that expose the server's file system path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core vulnerability is a **Path Disclosure** issue. This stems from flaws in the product's scripts, leading to warnings or fatal errors that reveal the server-side script's true path. Specifically:
    *   **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to validate inputs to `mktime`, `date`, `preg_replace` and `htmlspecialchars` functions properly. This results in the generation of error messages that reveal server file paths.
    *   **PHP Error Handling:**  PHP error messages are not properly suppressed or handled, which allows the full path of the web application's directory structure to be output in error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Confidentiality Impact:**  The primary impact is the exposure of sensitive information. Attackers can discover the full server path of the myBloggie installation, which could be a crucial piece of information for planning more complex attacks. This can allow a malicious user to gather information about the server infrastructure and potentially target specific files and folders.
    *  **Integrity Impact:** None
    *  **Availability Impact:** None

**Attack Vectors:**
   *   The attack vector is through HTTP requests, targeting the application's scripts:
        *   `index.php` with specific crafted `month_no` and `year` parameters (triggering `calendar.php` error).
        *   `common.php` by accessing the script directly to trigger the preg_replace error.
        *   `login.php` by passing an array to the `mode` parameter (triggering the `htmlspecialchars` error)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   *   The attacker needs network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable myBloggie application.
   *   No authentication is required. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests without any login requirements.
    *   The attacker should be able to craft URLs with specific parameters to trigger the errors in the vulnerable scripts.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory specifies that the issue is present in myBloggie version 2.1.6.
*   The provided information indicates the vendor was notified but did not respond.
*   A workaround is provided - disabling PHP error messages by changing the display\_errors setting in the php.ini file.
*   The advisory provides specific examples of the requests and responses that demonstrate the path disclosure vulnerability.
*   The issue is described as a low complexity and medium severity risk.
*   The report is uncorroborated.
*  The issue can be triggered if PHP version is less than 5.0.0 and running on Windows Hosting for the `calendar.php` vulnerability.
