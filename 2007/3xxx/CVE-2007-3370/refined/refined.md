Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-3370

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure inclusion of files in Sun Board 1.00.00 alpha. Specifically, the application uses user-supplied input to construct file paths in `require` or `require_once` statements, without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The core vulnerability is that the application includes remote files, meaning an attacker can force the application to execute code from a location controlled by them.
-  Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize the user-supplied parameters `sunPath` and `dir` before using them in file inclusion statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve remote code execution by including a malicious PHP file hosted on a server they control. This can lead to complete compromise of the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Data Breaches/System compromise:** With the ability to execute arbitrary code, an attacker could access sensitive data, modify the database, or install backdoors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET requests:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts.
 - The `sunPath` parameter in `include.php` and the `dir` parameter in `/skin/board/default/doctype.php` are used to specify the path of the file to include.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Control of a web server:** The attacker must have a web server where they can host the malicious PHP file to be included.
- **Understanding of the vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters (`sunPath`, `dir`), and vulnerable files (`include.php`, `/skin/board/default/doctype.php`) to target the application.
