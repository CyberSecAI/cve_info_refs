How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Portcullis Security Advisory

Vulnerable System:

Visionsoft Audit

Vulnerability Title:

The VSAOD server has input validation flaws which can result in an unauthenticated \
heap overflow.

Vulnerability discovery and development:

Portcullis Security Testing Services discovered this vulnerability during an \
application assessment.  Further research was then carried out post assessment.

Credit for Discovery:

Tim Brown - Portcullis Computer Security Ltd.

Affected systems:

All known versions of Audit, the vulnerability was discovered for version 12.4.0.0.

Details:

It is possible to set the log file name on the remote VSAOD server using the \
following unauthenticated exchange:

client> LOG.<filename>
server> Logfile set to: <filename>

When the file name passed is of sufficient length, the remote VSAOD server will \
terminate.  As the server writes the file to its file prior to crashing, the server \
will terminate every time it is restarted until the ini file has been fixed.

Impact:

An attacker could cause a Denial of Service or execute arbitrary code.  Since the \
VSAOD server typically runs as SYSTEM, an attacker who successfully executes \
arbitrary code will fully compromise the system.

Exploit:

Exploit code is not required.

Portcullis Security Advisory 06-042

Vulnerable System:

Visionsoft Audit

Vulnerability Title:

The VSAOD server uses a weak algorithm to obscure passwords on the wire and within \
configuration files.

Vulnerability Discovery and Development:

Portcullis Security Testing Services discovered this vulnerability during an \
application assessment.  Further research was then carried out post assessment.

Credit For Discovery:

Tim Brown and Mark Lowe - Portcullis Computer Security Ltd.

Affected systems:

All known versions of Visionsoft Audit, this vulnerability was discovered for version \
12.4.0.0.

Details:

Passwords used to authenticate with the remote VSAOD server prior to the execution of \
the requested executable are obscured on the wire and in configuration files using an \
XOR based algorithm.

Impact:

An attacker who compromised a system running a VSAOD server could unobscure the \
password identified through eavesdropping the network traffic or from the \
configuration file.  Typically this will be a domain account with privileged access \
to the systems on the network.  The attacker potentially will be able to authenticate \
with these systems using other servers.  Note: The configuration file typically has \
read permissions for both Users and Power Users.

Exploit:

Exploit code is not required.

Portcullis Security Advisory 06-044

Vulnerable System:

Visionsoft Audit.

Vulnerability Title:

The VSAOD server allows remote execution via replay attacks.

Vulnerability Discovery and Development:

Portcullis Security Testing Services discovered this vulnerability during an \
application assessment. Further research was then carried out post assessment.

Credit for Discovery:

Tim Brown - Portcullis Computer Security Ltd.

Affected systems:

All known versions of Audit, this vulnerability was discovered for version 12.4.0.0.

Details:

In order for the Audit client to schedule an audit it connects to the remote VSAOD \
server and initiates the following exchange:

server> Visionsoft Audit on Demand Service
server> Version: 12.4.0.0
server>
client> DETAILS
client> <windows domain>
client> <user name>
client> <obscured password>
client> OK
client> PROCESS
client> <path to executable>
server> <status message|OK|FAIL message>

The VSAOD server will then switch to the supplied Windows domain account and execute \
the requested executable.  The supplied Windows domain account does not require \
special privileges, although obviously using a privileged account will allow the \
executable more access to the remote server.  The username and password can be \
obtained in a number of ways (some of which are vulnerabilities in their own right) \
including eavesdropping a legitimate session.  The requested executable can be either \
local to the remote server or available via a Microsoft Windows Network share.

Impact:

An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server, by passing normal Windows \
security mechanisms.

Exploit:

Exploit code is not required.

Portcullis Security Advisory 06-057

Vulnerable System:

eVisit Analyst.

Vulnerability Title:

The multiple CGI scripts allow SQL injection.

Vulnerability discovery and development:

Tim Brown of Portcullis Computer Security Ltd.  The vendor has been notified and the \
vulnerability fixed.

Affected systems:

All known versions of eVisit Analyst.

Details:

By modifying the id parameter which is passed during a request to the idsp1.pl, ip.pl \
and einsite_director.pl CGI scripts, it is possible to cause error messages to be \
returned which indicates the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability.  The same \
error messages also discloses the web root path.

Impact:

Portcullis believe that the script concerned can not be exploited due to the way in \
which it operates; however, this can not be confirmed with a full inspection of the \
source code.

Portcullis Security Advisory 06-058

Vulnerable System:

ImgSvr.

Vulnerability Title:

The ImgSvr is vulnerable to a stack overflow.

Vulnerability discovery and development:

Portcullis Security Testing Services.  Further research was then carried out by Tim Brown and
Neil Kettle.

Credit for Discovery:

Tim Brown and Neil Kettle of Portcullis Computer Security Ltd.

Affected systems:

All known versions of ImgSvr.

Details:

Following the Bugtraq posting "imgsvr dos exploit by n00b" which described a
remote Denial of Service of the Windows version of ImgSvr, research was carried out which
indicated that the Linux version was also vulnerable to the same attack
although, significantly more input was required.

Through further research, it was then identified that the same remote Denial of
Service could also be caused by passing a large value to the template parameter as
follows:

GET /?template=<large value> HTTP/1.0

In both cases this led to ImgSvr failing within the internal ADA function
system__file_io__open.  Due to the way the Linux implementation of the GNU ADA
compiler works to protect against stack overflows, a secondary stack of $ebp,
$eip and $esp is maintained above the primary stack.  When our request causes
system__file_io__open to fail, an exception is caught by the exception handler
which uses the values of the secondary stack in an attempt to handle the
exception in a graceful manner.  However, because we have smashed through into
the $ebp and $eip values on the secondary stack, we can influence further code
execution.

Impact:

An attacker could cause a Denial of Service or execute arbitrary code.
In addition, it is believed that variants of this vulnerability may exist in
other products.  ImgSvr uses AWS, a generic web server implemented in ADA
which is likely to have been used in other products.  In addition, the flaw
in the secondary stack implementation can be attributed to the GNU ADA compiler
and is not unique to ImgSvr.

Exploit:

The proof of concept exploit code is available.

Portcullis Security Advisory 06-060

Vulnerable System:

SurgeMail.

Vulnerability Title:

SurgeMail is prone to a format string vulnerability.

Vulnerability discovery and development:

Portcullis Security Testing Services discovered this vulnerability.
Further research was then carried out.

Credit For Discovery:

Nico Leidecker - Portcullis Computer Security Ltd.

Affected systems:

Version 3.7b8 Linux and maybe previous versions and on other platforms.

Details:

SurgeMail offers the ability to charge the recipients a fee for receiving
emails from certain addresses. As soon as such an email comes in, a
notification email containing the amount payable is composed and sent to the
user requesting payment.  A user with the privileges allowing them to change
these amounts is then able to exploit a format string vulnerability, caused by
the abdiction of an explicit format string while using the amount value as
parameter in such a function. Furthermore, the amount value can consist of
arbitrary characters.

Portcullis Security Advisory 06-061

Vulnerable System:

SurgeFTP

Vulnerability Title:

The mirror mechanism allows Denial of Service.

Vulnerability discovery and development:

Portcullis Security Testing Services discovered this vulnerability.
Further research was then carried out.

Credit for Discovery:

Nico Leidecker - Portcullis Computer Security Ltd.

Affected systems:

Version 2.3a1 Linux and is likely to affect other platforms.

Details:

SurgeFTP provides a mirror functionality but fails to detect malformated
command responses.  This concerns the PASV command and its response from the
mirrored server. SurgeFTP fails to parse a response to PASV properly so that
it will crash if the response was malformated.

Impact:

It may be possible for an attacker to shut down the service. By default,
SurgeFTP respawns after a couple of seconds. But then, immediately reconnects
to the mirrored server. As long as the attacker keeps sending malformated
PASV responses to the server, it will keep shutting down immediately after
restarting.

Exploit:

The proof of concept exploit code is available.

Vendor Status:

Vendor notified. The vulnerability has been fixed.

Portcullis Security Advisory 06-062

Vulnerable System:

SurgeFTP

Vulnerability Title:

SurgeFTP is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting(XSS).

Vulnerability Discovery And Development:

Portcullis Security Testing services discovered this vulnerability.
Further research was then carried out.

Credit For Discovery:

Nico Leidecker - Portcullis Computer Security Ltd.

Affected systems:

Version 2.3a1 Linux and probably other platforms.

Details:

SurgeFTP provides a web interface for managing mirrored servers. The state of
every last mirroring process is displayed in the overview screen. If SurgeFTP
receives a server response where the first characters are not the numeric
status code, an error message is printed which also includes the received
message from the mirrored server. SurgeFTP fails to sanitise HTML and script
code from that message.

Impact:

An attacker can gain root access on the server. In order to achieve that, he
will have the ability to execute script code that creates an FTP user who can
access the real root directory and acts without dropping privileges. In one
scenario, for the next step, the attacker accesses the vulnerable host via FTP
and uploads a modified crontab file with the intention of executing a command
which binds a shell to a port.

Exploit:

The proof of concept exploit code is available.

Vendor Status:

Vendor notified. The vulnerability has been fixed.

Portcullis Security Advisory 06-063

Vulnerable System:

centericq

Vulnerability Title:

Centericq is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflows.

Vulnerability Discovery And Development:

Portcullis Security Testing Services discovered this vulnerability.
Further research was then carried out..

Credit for Discovery:

Nico Leidecker - Portcullis Computer Security Ltd.

Affected systems:

Version 4.21 on FreeBSD and the official sources were tested as vulnerable.
Previous versions and those versions running on various Linux distributions may be
affected.

Details:

Centericq provides modules to several messaging and chat protocols.  The
modules for Yahoo, LiveJournal, Jabber and IRC are vulnerable to multiple
buffer overflows mainly, when the user receives a notification message for
certain events.  The following list identifies the events which have to be
undertaken in order to result in a possible buffer overflow.

IRC Hook
    - a user in the victims contact list changes his nickname. The sum of the
      length of his old and his new nickname has to be greater than 100.
    - a user joins or leaves a channel and the length of nickname and real
      name are greater than 512.
    - the victim obtains the IRC client information from another user. The
      information length must be greater than 512 bytes.
    - in the event message, when a user gets kicked from a channel and the
      length of his username and the name of the op user are greater than 512.
    - a third user or the victim gets opped or deopped by an op whereas length
      of username and op name are greater than 512.

Untested buffer overflows in the following modules:

Jabber Hook

    - the victim obtains the Jabber client information from another user. The
      information length must be greater than 512 bytes.

LiveJournal Hook

    - in the notification message, when the attacker adds or removes the victim
      to or from his friend list.

Yahoo Hook

    - in the notification message, when a user invites the victim to a
      conference.
    - if the attacker declines a conference invitation
    - a user joins or leaves a conference
    - a user gets informed, when he received a new email.
      when the total length of sender and subject are greater than 1024 a
      buffer overflow follows.

As an example:
One of the modules is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) module. The centericq user
is notified for every change of nickname for any user in his contact list and
logs it to a file. However, only 100 bytes are allocated for the log message
which includes both the old and new username. Furthermore, centericq fails to
check the sizes of the usernames and therefore suffers from a buffer overflow
if the sum of the length of old and new username is greater than 40 (format
string covers the remaining 60 bytes).  In order to get into the victims contact
list, the attacker simply sends a message to the user. He has not joined any
channel by doing that. In the next step, the attacker changes his nickname to
another name that may include arbitrary code to execute within the context of
the running of centericq.  Official IRC Servers may not support usernames that
are 20 bytes or longer. Although, the attacker could lead the victim to a server
controlled by him to exploit these vulnerabilities.

Impact:

The attacker could cause a Denial of Service or execute arbitrary code with
the users privileges.

Exploit:

The proof of concept exploit code is available.
