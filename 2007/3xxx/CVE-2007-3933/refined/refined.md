Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-3933

**Vulnerability Description:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `insertorder.cfm` file of QuickEStore 8.2.

**Root Cause:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `CFID` and `CFTOKEN` parameters within the `insertorder.cfm` page, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises from a lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database including the administrator password.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining the administrator password, an attacker gains full access to the application and can perform administrative functions including data manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to `insertorder.cfm`, manipulating the `CFID` and `CFTOKEN` parameters to inject SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker must possess a basic understanding of SQL in order to craft the injection queries.
- **Knowledge of the web application:** The attacker must know the path to the vulnerable `insertorder.cfm` page and the structure of the parameters.

**Technical Details from Exploit DB:**
- **Vulnerable URL:** `http://www.xxx.com/insertorder.cfm`
- **Vulnerable Parameters:** `CFID` and `CFTOKEN`
- **Example Exploit:**
    -   `http://www.xxx.com/insertorder.cfm?CFID=123&CFTOKEN=1 union select 1,2,3,password,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 from params"having 1=1`  (This particular example attempts to retrieve the admin password from the 'params' table.)
- **Admin Panel Location:** `http://www.xxx.com/admin/`
