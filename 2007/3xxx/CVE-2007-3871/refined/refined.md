Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the design choice of using sequential serial numbers as identifiers for stamps in SOAP requests, instead of random IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Identifiers:** The use of monotonically increasing serial numbers for stamp IDs makes them easily guessable.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The SOAP request to verify if a stamp has been printed is unauthenticated.
*   **IP Address Spoofing:** The SOAP request can be sent from a different IP address than the one used to download the PDF stamp.
*   **Security through obscurity:** The verification mechanism that a stamp has not been printed is done via Javascript and SOAP request which can be easily faked by an attacker

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can send SOAP requests for stamps faster than legitimate users, marking the stamps as "printed" before the users can actually print them.
*   **Customer Disruption:** This leads to customers being unable to use the stamps they paid for, resulting in a service disruption and angry customers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker sends crafted SOAP requests to the server via HTTP.
*   **Remote:** The attack can be carried out remotely from any location with network access to the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Stampit Web server.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the SOAP request and how the serial numbers for stamps are generated.
*   **Minimal Resources:** As few as 10 HTTP requests per second can disrupt the service.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in the Stampit Web application, used for online stamp purchases from Deutsche Post IT Solutions and GFT Technologies AG.
*   The service was also used in the UK ("SmartStamp") and Switzerland ("WebStamp").
*   The SOAP requests are used by a Javascript present in the stamp's PDF before printing to check if the stamp is valid.
*   The advisory mentions that a starting point for stamp IDs can easily be found via binary search, as the SOAP server replies which stamps it has already seen, and one does not need to buy a stamp in order to exploit this vulnerability.
*   A temporary workaround would be to restrict the SOAP requests to the IP address from which the PDF was downloaded.
