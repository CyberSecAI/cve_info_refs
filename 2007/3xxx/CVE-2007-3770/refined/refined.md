Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2007-3770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `terminal_helper_execute()` function within the `terminal-helper.c` file of Xfce Terminal. This function fails to properly escape shell meta-characters in URIs before processing them when a user clicks "Open Link". This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The core issue is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input (the URI). Specifically, the application fails to escape shell metacharacters in the URI string that are later passed to a shell.
- Command Injection:  Due to the lack of proper escaping, an attacker can insert shell commands within the URI which will be executed by the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Command Execution: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the user's system with the privileges of the user running the Xfce Terminal.
- Information Disclosure: By injecting commands that retrieve environment variables or files, an attacker could also steal sensitive information.
- System Compromise:  Depending on the user's permissions, a successful exploit could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URIs: An attacker must trick the victim into clicking on a specially crafted URI. This could be achieved through various means such as:
    - Phishing emails
    - Malicious websites
    - Instant messages
    - Social Engineering

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote Position: An attacker does not need local access to the user's machine.
- Ability to Generate Malicious URIs: The attacker must be able to generate a malicious URI with embedded shell commands.
- Social Engineering: The attacker needs to persuade a user to click the malicious link.

**Technical Details:**

- Xfce Terminal uses `/bin/sh -c` along with `gdk_spawn_on_screen` to open links. This is where the unescaped URIs are passed for execution.
- Example URIs were provided to demonstrate the exploit:
   - `http://foo.bar/$(xterm)/` (remote command execution)
   - `<http://google.com/search?q=$(ls)&sourceid=b0rk>` (information stealing)
   - `<http://google.com/search?q=$HOME>` (environment examination)

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the upstream Xfce developers in November 2006 but wasn't fixed until July 2007.
- Patches were made available in various distributions such as Gentoo, Debian, and Ubuntu.
- The provided documents show the fix was deployed in xfce4-terminal version 0.2.6_p25931 in Gentoo and 0.2.5.6rc1-2etch1 for Debian stable.
- Ubuntu also released corrected package versions: 0.2.6-0ubuntu3.1 (7.04), 0.2.5.4-0ubuntu2.1 (6.10), and 0.2.5+r21674-0ubuntu2.1 (6.06).
