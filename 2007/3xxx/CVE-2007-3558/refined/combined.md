Coppermine 1.4.11 - Security release.

The development team is releasing a security update for Coppermine in order to counter a recently discovered mySQL vulnerability that can lead to disclosure of sensitive information. It is important that all users update to this latest version as soon as possible.

To correct the security issue manually, you can apply a fix to include/functions.inc.php. Please note that applying the manual fix will keep you secure, but it is not a substitute for updating your gallery fully, as there are several other non-security related fixes that went into cpg1.4.11 as well.

To manually fix the vulnerability, edit include/functions.inc.php (using a plain-text editor), findCode Select Expand `$aid_str = implode(",",array_keys($alb_pw));`and replace withCode Select Expand`foreach($alb_pw as $aid => $value) {
            $aid_str .= (int)$aid . ",";
          }

          $aid_str = substr($aid_str, 0, -1);`

The following issues have been addressed in this release:

* 2007-06-28 Fixed a vulnerability where SQL injection was possible with array indices of album password cookie {Abbas}
* 2007-03-30 Renamed default cookie name to version-independant name to avoid confusion for beginners {GauGau}

All old versions/archives were packed this way:
Archive name: [cpg1.4.8.zip](//cpg1.4.8.zip) -> Folder name inside: cpg148
Archive name: [cpg1.4.9.zip](//cpg1.4.9.zip) -> Folder name inside: cpg149
Archive name: [cpg1.4.10.zip](//cpg1.4.10.zip) -> Folder name inside: cpg1410

The new one is packed as:
Archive name: [cpg1.4.11.zip](//cpg1.4.11.zip) -> Folder name inside: cpg1.4.11

I accustomed to old folder name inside.

This was a misprint in GauGau's post?
Or there were also an "error" in 1.4.11 archive and it was updated?

It wasn't a typo on GauGau's part. It was the code at the time that he posted the message. This was discussed in a dev-only thread and the latter one was the correct version, and is also the one in the archive.

The archive contains the incorrect version since it was released prior to the fix being agreed upon by the dev team. If you have multiple password protected albums in your gallery then you need to fix the code in your copy by making the additional code change in TranzNDance's edit, ie.

Code Select Expand`$aid_str = (int)$aid . ",";`
to
Code Select Expand`$aid_str .= (int)$aid . ",";`

Oh, sorry for the confusion. I did my upgrade through svn so I had the correct version and figured that was in the archive.

No - once a package is released, the files within the archived don't get changed, even if they contain a bug. I'm currently packaging a new version, please stand by. Locking this thread now.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
