  "CVE-2007-3089": {
    "description": "Ronen Zilberman and Michal Zalewski discovered that a timing race allows the injection of content into about:blank frames.",
    "technical_details": [
      "A timing race condition exists in how Mozilla Firefox and related browsers handle about:blank iframes.",
      "When Javascript code instructs MSIE6/7 to navigate away from a page that meets same-domain origin policy to an unrelated third-party site, there is a window of opportunity for concurrently executed Javascript to perform actions with the permissions for the old page but the content of the new page.",
        "Specifically, when a window is opened from a script, the content of the new window's iframes can be spoofed within a short timeframe while the window is loading due to the frame's location being 'about:blank' during this time.",
      "This is not easily exploitable if the victim is navigating from one page to another. The attacker needs a page where he can modify it's content, then redirect the user.",
    
      "The check implemented means that about:blank frames can be overwritten freely; and unfortunately, \*all\* frames, even with Internet SRC= specified, will be vulnerable to a race condition while the document loads"
    ],
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Race condition",
        "Insufficient enforcement of same-origin policy"
    ],
     "impact": [
        "Cookie stealing / setting",
        "Page hijacking",
        "Memory corruption",
        "Keyboard snooping",
         "Content spoofing",
           "Non-consensual download or execution of files"

    "attack_vector": "By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page",

      "Ability to inject malicious Javascript code",
