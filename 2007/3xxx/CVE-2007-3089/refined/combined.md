Hello,
Will keep it brief. A couple of browser bugs, fresh from the oven, hand
crafted with love:
1) Title : MSIE page update race condition (CRITICAL)
Impact : cookie stealing / setting, page hijacking, memory corruption
Demo : http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ierace/
...aka the bait & switch vulnerability.
When Javascript code instructs MSIE6/7 to navigate away from a page
that meets same-domain origin policy (and hence can be scriptually
accessed and modified by the attacker) to an unrelated third-party
site, there is a window of opportunity for concurrently executed
Javascript to perform actions with the permissions for the old page,
but actual content for the newly loaded page, for example:
- Read or set victim.document.cookie,
- Arbitrarily alter document DOM, including changing form submission
URLs, injecting code,
- Read or write DOM structures that were not fully initialized,
prompting memory corruption and browser crash.
This is tested on MSIE6 and MSIE7, fully patched.
2) Title : Firefox Cross-site IFRAME hijacking (MAJOR)
Impact : keyboard snooping, content spoofing, etc
Demo : http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ifsnatch/
Bugzilla : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=382686 [May 30]
Javascript can be used to inject malicious code, including key-snooping
event handlers, on pages that rely on IFRAMEs to display contents or
store state data / communicate with the server.
This is related to a less severe variant independently reported by
Ronen Zilberman two weeks earlier (bug 381300).
3) Title : Firefox file prompt delay bypass (MEDIUM)
Impact : non-consentual download or execution of files
Demo : http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ffclick2/
Bugzilla : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=376473 [Apr 04]
A sequence of blur/focus operations can be used to bypass delay timers
implemented on certain Firefox confirmation dialogs, possibly enabling
the attacker to download or run files without user's knowledge or
consent.
3) Title : MSIE6 URL bar spoofing (MEDIUM)
Impact : mimicking an arbitrary site, possibly including SSL data
Demo : http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ietrap2/
MSIE6 vulnerability, similar but unrelated to my earlier onUnload
entrapment flaw, allows sites to spoof URL bar data.
MSIE7 is not affected because of certain high-level changes in the
browser.

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-3089

    Ronen Zilberman and Michal Zalewski discovered that a timing race
    allows the injection of content into about:blank frames.

CVE-2007-3656

    Michal Zalewski discovered that same-origin policies for wyciwyg://
    documents are insufficiently enforced.

CVE-2007-3734

    Bernd Mielke, Boris Zbarsky, David Baron, Daniel Veditz, Jesse Ruderman,
    Lukas Loehrer, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren, Olli Pettay, Paul
    Nickerson and Vladimir Sukhoy discovered crashes in the layout engine,
    which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-3735

    Asaf Romano, Jesse Ruderman and Igor Bukanov discovered crashes in the
    javascript engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2007-3736

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that the addEventListener() and setTimeout()
    functions allow cross-site scripting.

CVE-2007-3737

    "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that a programming error in event handling
    allows privilege escalation.

CVE-2007-3738

    "shutdown" and "moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that the XPCNativeWrapper allows
    the execution of arbitrary code.

The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include xulrunner.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version
1.8.0.13~pre070720-0etch1. A build for the mips architecture is not yet
available, it will be provided later.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in version
1.8.1.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xulrunner packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-20

## Frame spoofing while window is loading

Announced
July 17, 2007
Reporter
Ronen Zilberman and Michal Zalewski
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.5
* SeaMonkey 1.1.3

### Description

Ronen Zilberman and Michal Zalewski both reported that it was possible to exploit a timing issue to inject content into about:blank frames in a page.
When opening a window from a script, it is possible to spoof the content of the
newly opened window's frames within a short time frame, while the window is
loading.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=382686#c0)• 18 years ago |
|  | |

Firefox seems to allow third parties to replace IFRAME data of unrelated webpages by enabling non-same-domain sites to perform:
foo = open("","target\_name");
foo.frames['bar'].document.open();
foo.frames['bar'].document.write(...);
foo.frames['bar'].document.close();
Where "target\_name" is established by being opener of the targeted window, or setting window name before the user navigated away from the attack site, or knowing name assigned by the attacked site (if any).
Now, although newly written IFRAME data will inherit its location and permission from the writing page (and thus won't be able to directly interact with page elements or read window.top.document.cookie), it will be able to pull a couple of nasty tricks, say:
1) Call window.focus() and use onkeydown handler to intercept user's keystrokes on that site.
2) Display offensive, misleading or dangerous contents on trusted sites (spoofed login prompts, etc).
3) Track user behavior, including precise timing of arrival and departure, based on presence of named IFRAMEs.
Visible IFRAMEs are often used to render nested contents (forum or blog posts, photos, advertisements, etc) on various pages; and hidden IFRAMEs are commonly employed for user tracking or pre-XMLHttpRequest browser-server communications. As such, a good number of sites is affected one way or another.
In general, it sounds like a good idea to restrict document.write and other types of interaction with all types of frames based on creator's domain.

That bug is marked fixed1.8.1 - why does this testcase still "work" on branch 1.8 builds?

Jonas - good catch, but as Gavin pointed out, [bug 343168](/show_bug.cgi?id=343168 "VERIFIED FIXED - frame spoofing using document.open()") does not resolve this testcase. My initial description was vague, but this is a related, yet distinctive problem.
The problem you fixed there is that document.write() could be used to overwrite frames that originate from Internet-based SRC= pointing to non-same-domain site. This is fixed and throws a security exception.
Unfortunately, the check implemented means that about:blank frames can be overwritten freely; and unfortunately, \*all\* frames, even with Internet SRC= specified, will be vulnerable to a race condition while the document loads (see a modified version of [bug 343168](/show_bug.cgi?id=343168 "VERIFIED FIXED - frame spoofing using document.open()") testcase here):
<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/ifsnatch/modified.html>
You might want to rename this bug to include 'about:blank' in its title and reopen it. The only sane fix I see is to enforce frame policy based on frame parent's origin, too (will significantly limit exposure).

Blake, can we special-case about:blank if the containing frame element is from another domain?

The race condition is [bug 381300](/show_bug.cgi?id=381300 "RESOLVED FIXED - Frame spoofing is possible within a short time frame while the window is loading."), "Frame spoofing is possible within a short time frame while the window is loading". That bug also mentions the about:blank issue; I think the two issues are connected.

Yup, [bug 381300](/show_bug.cgi?id=381300 "RESOLVED FIXED - Frame spoofing is possible within a short time frame while the window is loading.") is far closer (you might want to check both testcases on trunk to confirm whether the about:blank fix implemented there would be sufficient).
Certainly the risk of 381300 is understated; spoofing is not the only attack possible (see cnn.com example).

Jonas, yeah, we could probably do that. We might need to deal with compat issues, though.
This bug only exists on the 1.8 branch, right? I believe that Boris implemented basically what Michal describes in the last paragraph of [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=382686#c4 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - [mz2] iframes from other sites can be changed while pointing at about:blank") in [bug 332182](/show_bug.cgi?id=332182 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Consider making about:blank use the parent principal").

Right. Because we have to check that caller can access |this| as well, and anyone can access about:blank on branch. Perhaps for about:blank documents on branch, we should skip the "caller can access |this|" part, or replace it with "caller is this document itself". That \_should\_ be ok regression-wise.
And yes, there should be no problem with about:blank on trunk. Flags: blocking1.9?Flags: blocking1.9-Flags: blocking1.8.1.5?Flags: blocking1.8.0.13?

The underlying bug is very much the same. The reported attack scenario differs from this entry in two aspects: the initial report considered only a more benign opportunity (page element spoofing vs snooping on user input), and did not account for the possibility that persistent about:blank frames that do not require a race condition to occur (which is important when considering a proper fix; but that point is moot if you plan to backport a more comprehensive fix from trunk).
Otherwise, same old. That's all I wanted to say there.

Marking blocking so we remember to verify that a fix for [bug 381300](/show_bug.cgi?id=381300 "RESOLVED FIXED - Frame spoofing is possible within a short time frame while the window is loading.") really does fix this testcase as well.Flags: blocking1.8.1.5? → blocking1.8.1.5+

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3
When opening a window from a script, it is possible to spoof the content of the newly opened window's frames within a short time frame, while the window is loading.
Because the exact time is non-constant and unknown, multiple attempt are carried out. The failed ones are silently discarded using a try catch block.
This is similar to [Bug 343168](/show_bug.cgi?id=343168 "VERIFIED FIXED - frame spoofing using document.open()").
Both the 'frames[x].document.open()' method (described in above bug) and a normal 'frames[x].document' method are shown to reliably produce the exploit.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
See attached test case.

It seems that the problem is this:
The frame's location is "about:blank" while it is being loaded, and it is during this time that it can be spoofed (after the parent document has been loaded, but before the framed document has been loaded).

I wonder whether we could at least port part of that (e.g. the default principal for subframes)... Not sure how easy that would be.

The trunk fix was in [bug 332182](/show_bug.cgi?id=332182 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Consider making about:blank use the parent principal"). Looking at it now, it might not be impossible to merge to branch, if we're sure it doesn't break the web (which seems likely). Some of the code is sure to not apply, and we'd need to add interfaces instead of changing them, but it might be doable in general.... Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to do it in the near future. :(

I think it's a critical vulnerability, do I? It's very dangerous if someone using this exploit to steal accounts..
I really appreciate if you can fix this since next branch build..

It is gaining in publicity.
NIST's Vulnerability DB lists the CVSS Severity at a 10.0(High) <http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2007-3089>
All Fx users at my work got a message from our corp security team last week telling us to uninstall Fx immediately.

Attached patch

[Backport of fix for bug 325816 and bug 332182 to 1.8 branch](attachment.cgi?id=269025&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=269025&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=381300&attachment=269025)

I've confirmed that this patch fixes the "exploit testcase" in this bug. I have NOT had a chance to do any other testing yet. In particular, I have not run it on the tests attached to [bug 332182](/show_bug.cgi?id=332182 "RESOLVED FIXED - [FIX]Consider making about:blank use the parent principal"). It would be great if someone would, with all the various new-window pref settings (at the very least, with the settings to force all new windows into windows, tabs, and same rendering area).
Note that the tests can be run with jssh; I think we have some documentation on mozilla.org for that.
I'll try to get this also ported to the 1.8.0 branch.

I should also note that if run under jssh the tests will do the different pref values automatically... So that's really the way to go, imo.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

The Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution (sarge) are no longer
supported with security updates. You're strongly encouraged to upgrade to
stable as soon as possible.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version
1.0.10~pre070720-0etch1. A build for the mips architecture is not yet available,
it will be provided later.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in version
1.1.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the

### Problem description

This update brings Mozilla Firefox to security update version 2.0.0.5

Following security problems were fixed:

* MFSA 2007-18: Crashes with evidence of memory corruption The usual collection of stability fixes for crashes that look suspicious but haven't been proven to be exploitable. 25 were in the browser engine, reported by Mozilla developers and community members Bernd Mielke, Boris Zbarsky, David Baron, Daniel Veditz, Jesse Ruderman, Lukas Loehrer, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren, Olli Pettay, Paul Nickerson,and Vladimir Sukhoy (CVE-2007-3734) 7 were in the JavaScript engine reported by Asaf Romano, Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov (CVE-2007-3735)
* MFSA 2007-19 / CVE-2007-3736: XSS using addEventListener and setTimeout moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that scripts could be injected into another site's context by exploiting a timing issue using addEventLstener or setTimeout.
* MFSA 2007-20 / CVE-2007-3089: frame spoofing Ronen Zilberman and Michal Zalewski both reported that it was possible to exploit a timing issue to inject content into about:blank frames in a page.
* MFSA 2007-21 / CVE-2007-3737: Privilege escallation using an event handler attached to an element not in the document Reported by moz\_bug\_r\_a4.
* MFSA 2007-22 / CVE-2007-3285: File type confusion due to %00 in name Ronald van den Heetkamp reported that a filename URL containing %00 (encoded null) can cause Firefox to interpret the file extension differently than the underlying Windows operating system potentially leading to unsafe actions such as running a program.

Firefox and Thunderbird are among those which can be launched, and both support a "-chrome" option that could be used to run malware. This problem does not affect Linux.
* MFSA 2007-24 / CVE-2007-3656: unauthorized access to wyciwyg:// documents Michal Zalewski reported that it was possible to bypass the same-origin checks and read from cached (wyciwyg) documents
* MFSA 2007-25 / CVE-2007-3738: XPCNativeWrapper pollution shutdown and moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported two separate ways to modify an XPCNativeWrapper such that subsequent access by the browser would result in executing user-supplied code.

## Mozilla Firefox allows cross-domain iframe access via JavaScript

#### Vulnerability Note VU#143297

Original Release Date: 2007-06-08 | Last Revised: 2008-03-14

---

### Overview

Mozilla Firefox allows cross-domain access to an iframe. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to interact with a web site in a different domain. The attacker could read content and cookies, capture keystrokes, and modify content.

### Description

| An [iframe](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp) is an HTML element which allows an HTML document to be embedded inside a master HTML document.  The [Mozilla same origin policy](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/same-origin.html) states:*The same origin policy prevents document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from a different origin. The policy dates from Netscape Navigator 2.0.Mozilla considers two pages to have the same origin if the protocol, port (if given), and host are the same for both pages.*Firefox does not properly enforce the same origin policy to web pages that use iframes. From Mozilla Bugzilla Bug ID [382686](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=382686):*The problem you fixed there is that document.write() could be used to overwrite frames that originate from Internet-based SRC= pointing to non-same-domain site. This is fixed and throws a security exception.Unfortunately, the check implemented means that about:blank frames can be overwritten freely; and unfortunately, \*all\* frames, even with Internet SRC= specified, will be vulnerable to a race condition while the document loads.*Note that some websites that allow users to supply content may allow iframes to be included. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to obtain sensitive data from a user, modify the appearance of a webpage or track keystrokes. Depending on the nature of the web site the user was visiting, this data may include passwords, credit card numbers, and any arbitrary information provided by the user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Mozilla has addressed this issue with Firefox 2.0.0.5. Please see Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory [2007-20](http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2007/mfsa2007-20.html) for details. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds for users**     + Disable JavaScript (see [Securing Your Web Browser](http://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/securing_browser/)). + Use the [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/722) Firefox Add-on to whitelist what sites can run JavaScript. + Type in URLs directly in the web browser's address bar, or use bookmarks to navigate to websites. + See the [Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities](http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/cross_site_scripting.pdf) document for general information.  **Workarounds for administrators**    + Do not allow user submitted content to include JavaScript. + Do not allow users to submit content to a shared resource that includes iframes. A shared resource may include the comments section of a blog or a web forum. + Monitor the content submitted by third parties for malicious JavaScript or iframes. |

# Mozilla products: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200708-09**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox,
Thunderbird, SeaMonkey and XULRunner, some of which may allow user-assisted
arbitrary remote code execution.

| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.8.1.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.8.1.6** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser from the Mozilla Project,
and Mozilla Thunderbird an email client. The SeaMonkey project is a
community effort to deliver production-quality releases of code derived
from the application formerly known as the 'Mozilla Application Suite'.
XULRunner is a Mozilla runtime package that can be used to bootstrap
XUL+XPCOM applications like Firefox and Thunderbird.

### Description

Mozilla developers fixed several bugs, including an issue with
modifying XPCNativeWrappers (CVE-2007-3738), a problem with event
handlers executing elements outside of the document (CVE-2007-3737),
and a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2007-3736). They
also fixed a problem with promiscuous IFRAME access (CVE-2007-3089) and
an XULRunner URL spoofing issue with the wyciwyg:// URI and HTTP 302
redirects (CVE-2007-3656). Denials of Service involving corrupted
memory were fixed in the browser engine (CVE-2007-3734) and the
JavaScript engine (CVE-2007-3735). Finally, another XSS vulnerability
caused by a regression in the CVE-2007-3089 patch was fixed
(CVE-2007-3844).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to
the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service. It is also
possible for an attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks, which
could result in the exposure of sensitive information such as login
credentials.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.6"
```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.6"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-2.0.0.6"
```

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-2.0.0.6"
```

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.1.4"
```

All SeaMonkey binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-bin-1.1.4"
```
