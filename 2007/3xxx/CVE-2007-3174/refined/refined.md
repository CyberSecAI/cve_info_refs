The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in W2B Online Banking, including SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**SQL Injection:**
*   **Root cause:** Input passed to the "draft" parameter in "mailer.w2b" and the "listDocPay" parameter in "DocPay.w2b" is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input sanitization leading to SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Allows manipulation of SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Remote SQL injection via HTTP requests to the vulnerable scripts.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:** Remote attacker can send crafted HTTP requests with malicious SQL code in the parameters.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
*   **Root cause:** Input passed to the "adtype" parameter in "auth.w2b" is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient input sanitization leading to XSS vulnerability.
