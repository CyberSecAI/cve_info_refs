Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the insufficient access control in the administration panel of MyCMS. Specifically, the code checks for an 'admin' cookie but does not properly authenticate the user. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication and access admin functionality by simply setting a cookie named "admin." This lack of proper authentication allows an attacker to modify the `settings.inc` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authentication in the administrative section. The code only checks for the presence of an 'admin' cookie, without verifying its validity.
*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):**  The ability to edit the `settings.inc` file, which is included in other pages, allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code, leading to RCE.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The attacker can inject PHP code into the `settings.inc` file, which is included by other application files. The injected code is executed server-side which can be used to achieve remote command execution.
*   **Full System Compromise:**  With RCE, an attacker can potentially gain full control over the web server and potentially the underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is primarily through crafting HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The exploit script shows how to send a GET request to retrieve the contents of `settings.php` and a POST request to upload the modified file.
*  **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to set a cookie with the name "admin" to access the vulnerable admin section.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the target server.
*   **Basic HTTP Understanding:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and cookies to craft the exploit.
*   **No prior authentication:** No valid credentials or existing account is needed to launch this attack, simply setting an admin cookie is enough to bypass the authentication.

The provided exploit script automates the following:
1.  Checks if the `piggy_marty.php` backdoor shell already exists.
2. Retrieves the contents of the `settings.inc` via the `settings.php` page.
3. Modifies the `settings.inc` content to inject php code that creates `piggy_marty.php` backdoor shell.
4.  Posts the modified content back to the `settings.php` page.
5. Executes the injected code by sending a request to any page that includes settings.inc (e.g. `index.php`).
6. Executes the command using the created backdoor shell.
