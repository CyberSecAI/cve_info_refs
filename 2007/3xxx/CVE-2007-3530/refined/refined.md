```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `id` parameter of `videos.php`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection in videos.php?id parameter",
    "Path disclosure",
        "Default admin credentials"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data extraction, modification, or deletion. The attacker could also gain access to the application's configuration file, revealing sensitive information such as database credentials. Furthermore, arbitrary code execution on the server is possible through a shell upload.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP GET request to `videos.php` with a crafted `id` parameter",
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server and the ability to send HTTP requests. No authentication is required to exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability"
