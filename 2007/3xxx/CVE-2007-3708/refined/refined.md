Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3708:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input by the `xss_clean` function within CodeIgniter 1.5.3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
  - Stealing user session cookies.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the web application.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through:
    1.  `String.fromCharCode` usage.
    2.  Malformed nested tag manipulations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker
- Medium attack complexity. No authentication required.
- Needs to inject malicious code into the application that is then displayed to other users.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information confirms that CodeIgniter 1.5.3 is vulnerable to XSS due to inadequate input sanitization in the `xss_clean` function.
- The vulnerability is triggered by using `String.fromCharCode` and malformed nested HTML tag manipulations.
- The `xss_clean` function attempts to sanitize data to prevent XSS but fails in this case.
- The advisory suggests using HTML Purifier as a more secure alternative to `xss_clean`.
- This CVE is part of a group of vulnerabilities found in CodeIgniter 1.5.3.
