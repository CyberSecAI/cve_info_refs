{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Portable Executable Viewer (peviewer.spl) component of Altap Salamander. The `strcat()` function is used to concatenate the PDB debug filename, read from the debug signature of a PE file, into a 1000-byte stack buffer without proper bounds checking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Use of unsafe `strcat()` function"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code. It can also be used to cause a crash by overwriting the saved SEH (Structured Exception Handler).",
    "attack_vectors": "The user needs to be convinced to view the PE information of a specially crafted PE file (DLL/EXE) using the Portable Executable Viewer.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PE file with an overly long PDB debug filename. The user must then open this file within Altap Salamander and choose to view the PE information using the 'Portable Executable Viewer'."
  },
    "affected_versions": [
        "Altap Salamander 2.5 with Portable Executable Viewer 2.02",
        "Servant Salamander 2.0 with Portable Executable Viewer 1.00"
    ],
  "poc_available": true,
  "patch_info": "Update to Altap Salamander version 2.51 when it is available."
