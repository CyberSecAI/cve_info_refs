Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3936:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The exploit-db.com content explicitly mentions "CVE: [2007-3937](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-3937) [2007-3936](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-3936)" indicating the content relates to CVE-2007-3936.
   - The Secunia content does not directly reference the CVE ID, but it discusses vulnerability research, which is relevant to the nature of the exploit-db entry.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is located in `filebrowser.asp` within the A-shop software.
   - The core issue is insufficient input validation within the `delfiles` parameter, allowing an attacker to manipulate this parameter to delete arbitrary files on the server, both inside and outside the designated directories.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to delete files outside the intended directory, without proper authorization checks or path sanitization.
   - **Potential SQL Injection:** The content also mentions "Also possible sql injections in other areas", although no further details are provided. This suggests that other vulnerabilities might exist in the A-shop software, but this content mainly focuses on the arbitrary file deletion.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - **Data Loss:** An attacker can delete critical files, potentially leading to website/application malfunction or data loss.
    - **Denial of Service:** Deletion of essential system files could lead to a denial-of-service condition.
    - **Information Disclosure (Indirect):** By deleting files, an attacker could effectively remove publicly available information, or potentially cause the site to reveal information through error messages or other means.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted HTTP request to the `filebrowser.asp` page, manipulating the `delfiles` parameter.
   - **Direct URL Access:** The proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability via a direct URL crafted with a `delfiles` parameter, `http://site.com/admin/filebrowser.asp?folder=products&delfiles=[del any file on server]`.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
   - **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path/Parameter:** The attacker must know the path to the vulnerable file (`filebrowser.asp`) and the vulnerable parameter (`delfiles`).
   - **No Authentication Required (Likely):** Based on the provided information and the nature of the vulnerability, it is likely the attacker doesn't need authentication to exploit this flaw, though this isn't explicitly stated in the exploit-db entry.

**Summary of Vulnerability (Based on provided content):**

The vulnerability in A-shop 0.70 allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `delfiles` parameter in `filebrowser.asp`. This is due to inadequate input validation. This can lead to data loss and a denial of service. The attack vector is a crafted HTTP request.

The secunia.com content focuses on the research aspect, highlighting the expertise of the team that discovers vulnerabilities like this one, but does not provide specific information on CVE-2007-3936.
