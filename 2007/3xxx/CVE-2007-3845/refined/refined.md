{
  "CVE-2007-3845": {
    "description": "Jesper Johansson discovered that missing sanitising of double-quotes and spaces in URIs passed to external programs may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary arguments to the helper program if the user is tricked into opening a malformed web page.",
    "Root cause": "Missing sanitization of double-quotes and spaces in URIs passed to external programs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Lack of proper URI encoding"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary argument injection to helper programs, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if the helper program is vulnerable.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious web pages with crafted URIs",
      "Malicious emails with crafted URIs"
    ],
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malformed web page or email. No other specific capabilities or positions are mentioned, so it is assumed that an external attacker can potentially exploit this."
