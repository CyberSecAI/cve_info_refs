Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-3899:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way Microsoft Word handles specially crafted Word files containing a malformed string, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability within Microsoft Word when processing malformed strings in Word files.
- This corruption can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the logged-on user.
- **System Compromise:**  If a user with administrative rights is affected, an attacker could gain complete control of the system.
- **Malicious Actions:** Attackers could install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Word file as an email attachment and trick the user into opening it.
- **Web-based:** An attacker can host a malicious Word file on a website and convince users to visit the site (e.g., by tricking them into clicking a link). Compromised websites or those hosting user-generated content could also be used to deliver the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious Word file with a specific malformed string.
- Ability to deliver the malicious file through email or host it on a website.
- Requires user interaction, i.e., user needs to open the malicious file.

**Affected Software:**
- Microsoft Word 2000 Service Pack 3
- Microsoft Word 2002 Service Pack 3
- Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac

**Mitigations:**
- The vulnerability cannot be exploited on the 2007 Microsoft Office system.
- Microsoft Office 2003 is not vulnerable to remote code execution from this issue; it may, however, exit unexpectedly.
- Users with limited rights accounts are less impacted than users with administrative rights.
- The Office Document Open Confirmation Tool for Office 2000 can help by prompting users before opening documents.
- Exercise caution by not opening files from untrusted or unexpected sources.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The vulnerability was privately reported to Microsoft.
- The provided document contains information about available updates, detection tools (MBSA, SMS), and deployment guidance, including command-line switches.
- The document also provides steps for file verification to confirm the update has been applied.
- The vulnerability was actively being exploited at the time of the security bulletin release.
- The update modifies how Microsoft Word handles specially crafted files to prevent memory corruption and arbitrary code execution. The update may not eliminate the possibility of unexpected exits, but it does address the vulnerability.
- Microsoft acknowledges the reporter of this vulnerability, Liu Kun-Hao.
