Papoo Content Management System Multiple Cross Site Scriptings Jun 12 2007
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
\* Product
Papoo Content Management System
\* Vulnerable Versions
Papoo Light 3.6
\* Vendor Status
The Vendor was notified and the issue fixed.
A patch is available at: http://www.papoo.de/index/menuid/204/reporeid/215
\* Details
The Papoo Content Management System is prone to multiple Cross Site Scripting
vulnerabilities. The application fails to sanitize user input from certain
characters in three cases:
1) The argument list of GET requests is shown in the page source and may
contain script code.
2) Visitor comments will appear in a message list in the internal administra-
tion interface. The Title can contain script code that will be executed
in the administrator's browser.
3) Internally sent messages between CMS users are shown unfiltered in the
message overview. (This requires a minimal set of privileges)
\* Impact
An attacker might be able to gain administrator privileges.
\* Exploit
No exploit required.
