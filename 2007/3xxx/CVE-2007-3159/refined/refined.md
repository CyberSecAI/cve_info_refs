- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MiniWeb HTTP server does not properly validate the `Content-Length` value in the POST header, allowing an attacker to control the allocation size of the `pucPayload` buffer.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow or underflow when processing the `Content-Length` header can lead to a small or negative value passed to `malloc`, which results in a heap overflow and a subsequent crash when writing the null terminator.

-  **Impact of exploitation:** This can lead to a denial of service due to a crash when the server attempts to write to an invalid memory address.

- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request with a negative value for the `Content-Length` header to the vulnerable server.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server, meaning they can be located anywhere on the network where the server is reachable.
