Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-3916:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `skkdic-expr.c` file in SKK Tools creates temporary files insecurely. It uses the process ID ($PID) to generate temporary file names in the form `$TMPDIR/skkdic$PID.{pag,dir,db}`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The vulnerability stems from the predictable naming of temporary files based on process IDs and the use of `$TMPDIR`. This allows for an attacker to predict the temporary file paths.
*   **Symlink Vulnerability:** The vulnerability allows a local attacker to create symbolic links in the directory where the temporary files are written, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** When SKK Tools writes to the temporary file, the target file pointed to by the symlink will be overwritten with the contents of the SKK temporary file. This overwrite can cause data loss, system compromise, or other malicious effects, depending on the target file.
*  **Potential for Privilege Escalation**:  If a user running a vulnerable application is tricked into running the application, and a local attacker had set up the proper symbolic link, a local attacker can overwrite files with the privileges of the user running the SKK application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the same system where the vulnerable SKK Tools application is running.
*   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker needs to create symbolic links within the directory where SKK Tools writes temporary files before the vulnerable application is run.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker must have a local user account on the system.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to create symbolic links in the directory where the vulnerable application creates temporary files, usually under `/tmp` or a directory specified by the $TMPDIR variable.
*  **Timing:** The attacker needs to create the symbolic link before the vulnerable application is run, and the application needs to be run by the target user to be exploited.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2-r1 of the `app-i18n/skktools` package.
* The vulnerability is categorized as "normal" severity and "exploitable" locally.
