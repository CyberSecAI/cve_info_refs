How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-3038](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3038).

#### Mitigating Factors for Windows Vista Firewall Blocking Rule Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2007-3038

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factor may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability is restricted to only allow attacker to gain system information about the affected system. Valid user credentials would be required to access additional services or local resources.
* In Windows Vista, if the network profile is set to âPublicâ, the system is not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Windows Vista Firewall Blocking Rule Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2007-3038

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable Teredo**

  You can help protect against this vulnerability by disabling the Teredo transport mechanism. This prevents Teredo from being used as a transport or mechanism to traverse the NAT. To do this, run the following command as an administrator:

  **Netsh int ter set st disable**
* **Disable Teredo by modifying the registry.**

  Teredo can also be disabled by modifying the Windows registry. Create the following registry value to disable Teredo as a transport mechanism.

  Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe

  1. Start, click Run, type âregedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.
  2. Navigate to the following registry key: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\tcpip6\Parameters\
  3. Right click on the **DisabledComponents** key and select Modify.
  4. Set the value to **0x8** to disable Teredo.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you disable Teredo, depending on network configuration, applications that use the Teredo interface will not function or be accessible.
* **Block inbound and outbound Teredo UDP traffic using a Windows** **Vista** **Firewall setting.**

  A custom firewall rule can be created that blocks all Teredo related traffic from communicating with the affected system. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Control Panel** , click **Classic View.**
  2. Click **Administrative Tools** and then Double-click **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security** .
  3. Select **Inbound Rules.**
  4. Select **CoreNetworking - Teredo (UDP-In).**
  5. Right click, select **Properties.**
  6. Select â**Block the connections** â.
  7. Select **Outbound Rules.**
  8. Select **Core Networking - Teredo (UDP-Out).**
  9. Right click, select **Properties.**
  10. Select â**Block the connections** â.

  **Impact of Workaround:** If you block Teredo network traffic using the custom Windows Firewall rule, applications that use the Teredo interface will not function properly or be accessible.
* **Block Teredo UDP outbound traffic on perimeter firewalls.**

  Blocking all outbound UDP traffic destined to port 3544 at the network perimeter will disallow affected Vista systems from communicating with external attempts to exploit the vulnerability.

  **Impact of Workaround:** Depending on network configuration, applications that use the Teredo interface will not function or be accessible outside of the network perimeter.

#### FAQ for Windows Vista Firewall Blocking Rule Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2007-3038

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain information about the vulnerable system and be able to identify itâs existence on the network.

**What causes the vulnerability**

On Windows Vista, network traffic is handled incorrectly through the Teredo interface which causes some firewall rules to by bypassed.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass some of the firewall rules of an affected system.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could remotely activate the Teredo interface under certain configuration scenarios or would have to convince a user to click a link containing a Teredo network address on a Web site, in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message. Clicking the link would cause Teredo to enter an active state and subsequently cause the affected host to initiate communications with the attacker. This would then allow the attacker to know the targetâs Teredo network address which could then be used to send communications to the host that are not blocked by the local Windows Vista firewall. Additionally, as Teredo facilitates network tunneling once a connection is established with an attacker, it would also be possible for the communications to potentially bypass network perimeter firewalls.

**What is Teredo?**

**Teredo** is an IPv6 transition technology that provides address assignment and host-to-host automatic tunneling for unicast IPv6 traffic when IPv6/IPv4 hosts are located behind one or multiple IPv4 network address translators (NATs). To traverse IPv4 NATs, IPv6 packets are sent as IPv4-based User Datagram Protocol (UDP) messages. See the [TechNet](https://www.microsoft.com/technet/network/ipv6/teredo.mspx) Web site for more information regarding the Teredo service.

**Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?**

Yes, this vulnerability could be exploited over the internet once a user has clicked on specially crafted link containing an IPv6 address causing the Teredo interface to be activated.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Any Windows Vista system where the network profile is not set to âPublicâ could be at risk from this vulnerability. Windows Vista systems that use Remote Assistance or Meeting Space may be at more risk because these applications automatically place Teredo in an active state.

**What does the update do?**

The update modifies the Windows Vista firewall and core network components to ensure that the default behavior is to block unsolicited traffic over the Teredo interface.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

For more information on the support lifecycle policy, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Windows hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer will apply the LDR version of this update. Otherwise, the installer will apply the GDR version of the update. The LDR version of a file has a higher version number than the GDR version of a file. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with /quiet, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951). For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Removing the Update**

To remove this update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** , and then click **Search** .
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion** .
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search** .
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties** .

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

  **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

## Microsoft Windows Vista Teredo IPv6 interface firewall bypass vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#101321

Original Release Date: 2007-07-11 | Last Revised: 2007-07-11

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows Vista firewall may allow an attacker to send unfiltered IPv6 traffic to a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is an IP standard that is designed to replace the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). The [Microsoft Teredo service](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/network/ipv6/teredo.mspx) is used by Microsoft Windows Vista, XP, and Server 2003 to allow clients with only IPv4 connectivity to obtain and use publicly routable IPv6 addresses.  The Teredo service must be manually enabled by an administrator in Windows XP and Server 2003. The Teredo service is enabled by default in Windows Vista, but is not activated until an application requests an IPv6 address.The Windows firewall does not properly apply stateful packet inspection rules to incoming Teredo traffic.Note that the Teredo service may create a tunnel through perimeter firewalls, bypassing access control lists and content inspection filtering. See RFC 4380 [section 7.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4380#section-7.1) for more details. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unautheticated attacker may be able to send unsolicited and unfiltered IPv6 traffic to a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Microsoft has released an update to address this issue. Users are encourgaed to review Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-038](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-038.mspx) and take appropriate action. |
| --- |

| **Disable Teredo**Disabling the Teredo service will mitigate this vulnerability. See Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-038](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms07-038.mspx) for information on how to disable Teredo. |

## Aktuelles

### [Anstehendes Support-Ende (âEnd of lifeâ) von Windows 10](/blog/2024-10-14-windows-10-end-of-life)

Wir weisen darauf hin, dass Windows 10 ab dem 14. Oktober 2025 keine kostenlosen Sicherheitsupdates mehr erhÃ¤lt und ohne weitere MaÃnahmen nicht mehr im Uninetz betrieben werden darf. Wir zeigen mÃ¶gliche Optionen fÃ¼r Windows-10-Rechner auf. FÃ¼r neue Hardware oder kostenpflichtige Sicherheitsupdates kÃ¶nnen Kosten auf die Betreiber:innen zukommen.

### [Windows-Feature âRecallâ](/blog/2024-06-19-recall)

Aus aktuellem Anlass weist die Stabsstelle Informationssicherheit auf Probleme mit dem neuen Windows-Feature âRecallâ hin und rÃ¤t von der Verwendung ab.

### [Umgang mit vermeintlichen Warnungen des Virenscanners im Browser](/blog/2024-05-13-malicious-browser-popups)

Immer wieder erhalten wir Anfragen von Nutzer:innen, bei denen der Rechner den Fund von Malware meldet. Nicht in allen FÃ¤llen sind dies echte Warnungen unserer Endpoint Protection LÃ¶sung. Die andere ErklÃ¤rung ist, dass es sich um Push-Nachrichten aus dem Browser handeln kann, mit der die Person vor dem Rechner dazu verleitet werden soll, Malware zu installieren. Wir zeigen, wie sich falsche von echten Meldungen unterscheiden lassen und beschreiben am Beispiel von Google Chrome, wie Push-Nachrichten deaktiviert werden kÃ¶nnen.
