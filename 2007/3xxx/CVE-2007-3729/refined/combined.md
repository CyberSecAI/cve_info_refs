How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# VMS security vulnerability (POP server)

When a pop client requests access to the VMS POP server (Alpha VMS 8.3,
TCPIP Services 5.6) and provides incorrect username/password, this event
is not logged in the audit server. A simple message is sent to OPCOM.
This message does not contain any clue on the origin of the request.

So overnight, it becomes possible to run brute force attempts on
usernames via POP since no intrusion detection/evasion is made, and
short of many messages in operator.log, there is nothing in AnA/AUDIT
and no information on the IP address of the client that made those attempts.

(I got such an attack with thousands of attempts).

The whole intrusion detection scheme needs to apply to ALL services
which grant access to VMS via user/password combination and all such
application should comply to whateer calling standards to ensure that
all attempts with invalid credentials are properly logged, including IP
address and the username that was attempted.

attacks is the ability to sense a breakin attempt and deny access from
the breakin source even when it gets the password correct.

Did the attempt seem to target VMS or was it a script kiddie hacking at
a Windoze box or Unix box (accounts like administrator or root being
tried)

Works okay in IUPOP3 server <V2.0-4/NETLIB/(DECC) and TCPware V5.7-2.

Still broken in:

"HP TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS Industry Standard 64 Version V5.6 - ECO 1
on an HP rx2620 (1.60GHz/3.0MB) running OpenVMS V8.3"

Both IUPOP3 and TCPware POP3 log intrusions for each failed access and
then put you in "INTRUDER" state and initiate break-in evasion after
the appropriate number of failures. TCPIP (UCX) just logs the failures
to OPCOM.

There are a bunch of logical names that control TCPIP's POP3. None of
them seem to enable breakin evasion, though.

Plain vanilla POP3 isn't very secure since the usernames and passwords are
transmitted in plain text. There is an alternate APOP authorization method
that uses shared secrets instead. I haven't tried setting this up. It can
also be run over an SSL connection, where everything is encrypted. I haven't
tried setting this up either. (All my users are either on the LAN or
coming in over encrypted VPN connections, no WAN access to POP, and they
are all company employees with privileged VMS accounts anyway, so it
doesn't worry me very much.) Both of these alternate access methods can
be configured by logical names to be used in addition to or in place of
the standard plain-text access on port 110.

If you're letting the outside world get at port 110, then I would either
disable it or firewall it or use one of the alternatives (APOP or SSL)
instead.

Brute force. And VMS is even worse:

$ telnet/port=110 chain
%TELNET-I-TRYING, Trying ... 10.0.0.11
%TELNET-I-SESSION, Session 01, host chain, port 110
+OK TCPIP POP server V5.6-9, OpenVMS V8.3 Alpha at [chain.vaxination.ca](http://chain.vaxination.ca),

USER canada
-ERR No such user "canada"
USER system
+OK Password required for "system"
PASS chocolate
-ERR password supplied for "system" is incorrect.
%TELNET-S-REMCLOSED, Remote connection closed
-TELNET-I-SESSION, Session 01, host chain, port 110

So by checking whether the USER command returns an -ERR or +OK, you can
narrow down which usernames are valid, and then proceed to guess their
passwords by brute force.

Good job IUPOP3 does intrusion detection, and is easily available &
installable - I'd often wondered whether I ought to ditch it in favour
of the latest ucx/tcpip offering, but hadn't got around to it.

You make a convincing case for IUPOP3. It's source code, too, so if it
allows checking of user names in isolation, that would be easily fixable.

I some time ago also switched from IUPOP3 to TCPIP services, because it
serves the SSL port, and our domain requests that for outside connections.
I know one could tunnel SSL POP (using e.g. STUNNEL, which I do for IMAP
in my aging TCPIP 5.3), but this has the ugly effect of being one
connection at a time (and others get connection timeout and have to retry).

Although TCPIP services POP implementation seems to be based on IUPOP3,
is there a newer IUPOP3 implementation serving the SSL port ?

He is using TELNET from the source end. The destination is POP.
If he disables TELNET he can't get out of his box. :-) Somehow, I
don't think that will solve a problem with incoming POP connections.

Yes, but that behavior is up to the system manager. Messages
generated by the POP server can be either FRIENDLY or SECURE. For
example, if you don't want a potential attacker to be able to tell
whether or not a particular username exists, you can do:

$ DEFINE /SYSTEM /EXECUTIVE\_MODE TCPIP$POP\_SECURITY SECURE

Of course, you'll also want to make appropriate settings around other
ways to scan for valid usernames, such as SMTP, FINGER, FTP, and other
services you have enabled. Otherwise, the attacker who wants to know
whether user JONES exists will just try sending mail and see whether
it bounces.

For the POP server, the source of all access attempts (whether
successful or not) is captured in the file:

SYS$SYSDEVICE:[TCPIP$POP]TCPIP$POP\_RUN.LOG

If the target username exists, the login failure count is also
incremented so that the user will be notified of the failures upon the
next valid login.

Whoops, you're right. I forgot that we have TCPIP$POP\_LOG\_LEVEL
defined to THREAD on our systems, which adds to the detail recorded in
the logfile. For normal operation, especially if you have hundreds of
clients, each configured to check its mailbox every 5 minutes, you may
not want to capture that much information. I agree that logging the
client address should probably be the default, at least in cases where
there has been an invalid access attempt.

From Stephen Hoffman, Hoffman Labs:

JF Mezei has posted details of a security vulnerability in
the OpenVMS TCP/IP Services POP3 implementation (current
versions) into the comp.os.vms newsgroup, reportedly after
contacting HP with the initial report of the
vulnerability. Mr Mezei indicates a local OpenVMS Alpha
system was targeted by a POP3 dictionary attack.

Remote IP-based POP3-based dictionary attacks appear
feasible against passwords using this vulnerability, and
no breakin evasion processing is performed.

I've posted a quick review of the newsgroup report and
some suggestions at the HoffmanLabs site:

<http://64.223.189.234/node/395>

The original report is available here:

<http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.vms/msg/8a42e91fe1e9cd36>

It is unclear if other components of TCP/IP Services are
similarly afflicted.

Telnet in this instance is just being used to setup a connection to the POP
server port and then to pass the same commands that a pop client would send.
Telnet is often used in this manner. The telnet connection could come from
anywhere and the only way to stop telnet connections to the POP server port
would basically be to stop anyone connecting to that port eg not to run the POP
server.

> Brute force. And VMS is even worse:

The problem is that an application that accepts a username/password and
attempts to validate using $HASH\_PASSWORD and $GETUAI \*must\* also make
explicit calls to $SCAN\_INTRUSION, otherwise it provides a back door
around the intrusion detection mechanism. I have seen this on many
applications, including POP servers and web scripts to change your
password. With the benefit of hindsight, it might have been a better
idea to provide a $VERIFY\_PASSWORD service which combines the three
functions above, because it is so easy for a developer to overlook it.

Another place to check is if the UCX SMTP server supports SASL (this is
the "my-server-requires-authentication" checkbox in the POP client).
SASL allows the client to pass a username/password in the ESMTP dialog
so that you can allow authenticated clients to relay through your server
irrespective of what IP address they are coming from . Even PMDF
overlooked putting this through $SCAN\_INTRUSION when it first came out
(it was fixed pretty quickly). Only slightly more difficult to script
an attack on this one.

To check if your SMTP server supports SASL, telnet to port 25 and issue
an EHLO command. Look for the AUTH extension. It is harder to test
using telnet because the username/password pair need to be BASE64 encoded.

APOP works well in TCP/IP Services and setup is trivial. The username
is still passed in the clear, but the password is not. Setup can be
summarized as:

1. Create a POP\_SECRET.DAT file with your passphrase in your VMSmail
directory (secure it so that only the owner has access).
2. If necessary, tell your client that you're going to use APOP.

Full details for the server side can be found in the following section
of the TCP/IP Services User's Manual:

<http://h71000.www7.hp.com/doc/732FINAL/6525/6525pro_016.html#heading_5.12.1>

In the case of Thunderbird, you don't have to do anything extra --
when you connect, it asks for your password: simply provide your
passphrase.

You would still be able to use this thread's described attack vector
to identify user accounts, but it removes the ability to sniff
passwords on the wire, as only an MD5 hash of the passphrase is sent.

There is a POP3 with TLS support (TLS is supported by most POP3 clients), just

Was it you I helped with that UWSS that looked up SYSUAF? (and who now feels

[1] I saw your code and the SSL\_Read calls but I can't find any mention in
there, or the (minimalist) OpenSSL docs, about how to handle TCP/IP
Out-Of-Band character processing. I believe the SSLv3 specification
explicitly states that the OOB data is to be packaged up as a normal SSL
record (albeit wrappering a single byte) but it doesn't say much sbout how
the receiving end gets told about it. Flag? Record Type? Any ideas?

Is there a SSL\_Select somewhere?

Is there a MSG\_OOB flag on the read somewhere? (How do you do a MSG\_PEEK in
SSL for that matter?)

[2] Assuming that OpenSSL somehow surfaces the interface for OOB
transmission, can anyone see any reason why STUNNEL doesn't support it?
(unless it's "inlined")

[3] If OpenSSL is now a System Integrated Product (SIP) why is C the only
supported interface? It looks about as "Integrated" as a buttock boil!

I'm not a guru in the SSL programming. In the POP3 i have not used
the OOB processing.

I think that you can use "BIO object" to perform your specific
handling of the network I/O.

Sorry, I dunno.

I think that and prog. lang. can use the SSL API.

PS. If only IPSec was here and Network Layer Security was a reality on VMS
:-( Go and buy Multinet TODAY! Time and time again VMS engineering has
proven that they couldn't give two shits about UCX (apart from spending more
than the entire devlopment budget to rename it to TCP/IP Services) either
that or they are simply incapable of providing an industrial strength
version of the LP before everyone else has switch to CDs and iPods.)

But what the fuck do you care you "bread and circuses" system management
types? All you want is a new lexical function called f$bell\_volume(9) and
you're in raptures; throw in a couple of never-ending threads on
global-warming, noah's-ark and the gulf war and you're all nursing a semi!

Why HP refuses to take this useless bunch of twats serously is an absolute
mystery!
