Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3780:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MySQL server is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to an overflow in a signed character during authentication.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Signed char overflow. Specifically, the client tells the server the length of the ciphertext password. If that length is large enough to overflow a signed char, the number would jump to a very large number after being cast to unsigned int.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted authentication request that causes the MySQL server to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malformed password packet during the connection protocol. The attacker sends a password length byte greater than ordinal 127.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.

The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was addressed by casting the `*passwd` char to `uchar`. Patches were committed and pushed into versions 4.1.24, 5.0.44, and 5.1.20-beta.
