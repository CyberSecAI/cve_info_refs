{
  "CVE-2007-3639": {
    "Description": "Insufficient input sanitizing allowed for remote attackers to redirect visitors to external websites.",
    "Root cause": "The `wp_get_referer()` function in `wp-includes/functions.php` uses the `$_REQUEST` variable to retrieve the referrer URL. This allows an attacker to control the redirection URL by setting the `_wp_http_referer` parameter.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unvalidated input",
      "Open redirection"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can redirect victims to an arbitrary third-party website, which may be used for phishing attacks or malware distribution.",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "HTTP GET request with a crafted `_wp_http_referer` parameter",
       "HTTP POST request with a crafted `_wp_http_referer` parameter",
       "Cookie with a crafted `_wp_http_referer` value"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
       "Ability to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site",
       "Social engineering skills to trick users into visiting the malicious link."
    ]
