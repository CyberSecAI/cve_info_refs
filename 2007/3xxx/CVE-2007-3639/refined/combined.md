Coblentz](https://cxsecurity.com/author/Nick%2BS.%2BCoblentz/1/)**  Risk: **Medium** Local: **No** Remote: ****Yes**** CVE: **[CVE-2007-3639](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2007-3639/ "Click to see CVE-2007-3639")** CWE: **[CWE-Other](https://cxsecurity.com/cwe/CWE-Other "CWE-Other")**  CVSS Base Score: **4/10** Impact Subscore: **4.9/10** Exploitability Subscore: **4.9/10** Exploit range: **Remote** Attack complexity: **High** Authentication: **No required** Confidentiality impact: **Partial** Integrity impact: **Partial** Availability impact: **None** | | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

The vulnerability found could allow an attacker to redirect victims to
an arbitrary 3rd party site. This site could be a phishing site or
contain malware allowing the attacker to steal account credentials or
compromise hosts. This vulnerability can be found in Wordpress 2.2,
however it is likely that it exists in previous versions as well.
Additional vulnerabilities may exist in the following areas due to the
use of the problematic code:
wp-includes/pluggable.php (lines 282 to 292)
wp-includes/functions.php, wp\_nonce\_ays function (lines 1287 to 1313)
Description:
The wp-pass.php page can be used to redirect users to arbitrary third
party sites. An attacker may use this vulnerability to redirect users to
a phishing or malware site.
Relevant Code:
wp-pass.php (line 10)
wp\_redirect(wp\_get\_referer());
wp-includes/functions.php (line 1040 to 1045)
function wp\_get\_referer() {
foreach ( array($\_REQUEST['\_wp\_http\_referer'],
$\_SERVER['HTTP\_REFERER']) as $ref )
if ( !empty($ref) )
return $ref;
return false;
}
Exploit:
http://<WordpressSiteAddressHere>/wp-pass.php?\_wp\_http\_referer=http://ww
w.EvilPhishingOrMalwareSite.com
Since the function uses the $\_REQUEST variable, this attack could also
be executed using a cookie or post parameter named "\_wp\_http\_referer"
If this were a real attack, A link would be sent to users in an E-mail,
IM, or other delivery message to trick users into visiting the link.
Versions Affected:
This vulnerability is likely present in several previous versions of
Wordpress, however it was tested and verified in version 2.2.1
Vendor Response:
The Wordpress team is currently working on addressing this issue and
others in the 2.2.2 release of its blogging software.
Disclosure Timeline:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : wordpress
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-3639 CVE-2007-4153 CVE-2007-4154 CVE-2007-0540

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in wordpress,
a weblog manager. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-3639

    Insufficient input sanitising allowed for remote attackers to
    redirect visitors to external websites.

CVE-2007-4153

    Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities allowed remote
    authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2007-4154

    SQL injection vulnerability allowed allowed remote authenticated
    administrators to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2007-0540

    WordPress allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (bandwidth or thread consumption) via pingback service calls with
    a source URI that corresponds to a file with a binary content type,
    which is downloaded even though it cannot contain usable pingback data.

[no CVE name yet]

    Insufficient input sanitising caused an attacker with a normal user
    account to access the administrative interface.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.10-1etch2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
