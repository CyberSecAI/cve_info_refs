How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: dar: blowfish encryption weakened by frequent IV collisions
Date: Sun, 20 May 2007 18:03:11 -0600
```
Package: dar
Version: 2.3.2-1
Severity: important
Tags: security

I was looking through the crypto code in dar 2.3.2, and I found what I
think is a weakness in the Blowfish encryption code that results in
frequent initialization vector collisions.

Here is some background information from the dar(1) man page:

   -#, --crypto-block <size>

       to be able to randomly access data in an archive, it is not
       encrypted globally but block by block. You can define the
       encryption block size thanks to this argument which default to
       10240 bytes. Note that syntax used for -s option is also available
       here. Note also that crypto-block is stored as a 32 bits integer
       thus value larger than 4GB will cause an error. Note last, that the
       block size given here must be provided when reading this resulting
       archive (through the -* or -# options). If it is not the correct
       one, the archive will not be possible to decrypt, it is thus safe
       to keep the default value (and not use at all the -# option).

The offending code is in dar-2.3.2/src/libdar/crypto.cpp (lines 178-194):

178: void blowfish::make_ivec(const infinint & ref, unsigned char ivec[8])
179: {
180:     infinint upper = ref >> 32;
181:     U_32 high = 0, low = 0;
182:
183:     high = upper % (U_32)(0xFFFF); // for bytes (high weight)
184:     low = ref % (U_32)(0xFFFF); // for bytes (lowest weight)
185:
186:     ivec[0] = low % 8;
187:     ivec[1] = (low >> 8) % 8;
188:     ivec[2] = (low >> 16) % 8;
189:     ivec[3] = (low >> 24) % 8;
190:     ivec[4] = high % 8;
191:     ivec[5] = (high >> 8) % 8;
192:     ivec[6] = (high >> 16) % 8;
193:     ivec[7] = (high >> 24) % 8;
194: }

Things to note:
- ivec is 8 x 8 = 64 bits
- block_num is assumed to be 64 bits
- Each byte of ivec is being assigned a value modulo 8 (i.e. 3 bits wide),
  rather than a value modulo 256.
- The variables "high" and "low" are each assigned modulo 2**16-1 instead
  of modulo 2**32 (or even modulo 2**16, which would be equivalent to
  taking the lowest 4 bits of "upper" and "ref", respectively).

As far as I can tell, make_ivec is intended to serialize the 64-bit dar
block number ("ref") in a platform-independent way.  If it did that, it
would still be violating the NIST SP 800-38A requirement that "for the CBC
and CFB modes, the IV for any particular execution of the encryption
process must be unpredictable".  However, make_ivec actually *discards*
most of the bits of the block number, resulting in guaranteed IV collisions
at least every 8 'dar blocks' and a maximum effective IV length of slightly
less than 12 bits.

Using the default block size of 10240 bytes (as recommended by the dar
manual page), this translates into an IV collision every 81920 bytes, and
an IV space of less than 4096 possible values.

The result is a severely weakened implementation of Blowfish-CBC.

What make_ivec should probably do is (as recommended by NIST SP 800-38A,
Appendix C) to generate the initialization vectors encrypt the 64-bit block
number using blowfish and the same key that is used to encrypt the data
blocks.

tags 425335 + patch
thanks

Hello again!

I have attached a set of patches that improve the security of dar's
blowfish encryption, which is currently vulnerable to watermarking attacks.

The new code adds support for a new "blowfish2" cipher mode (which it also
makes the default), and emits a warning when a user creates an archive
using the legacy "blowfish" mode.

The original "blowfish" mode has the following weaknesses:
1. The password is used directly as keying material.
2. The 10240-byte sectors are individually encrypted using initialization
   vectors that are both predictable and frequently repeating.  This gives
   an attacker a lot of information.

The new "blowfish2" mode addresses these weaknesses by doing the following:
1. It derives the key from the password using the algorithm specified in
   PKCS#5[1].
2. It uses the ESSIV algorithm to generate initialization vectors[2] that
   will be unpredictable to anyone who doesn't have the archive password.

The patch also makes the following miscellaneous changes:
- Adds support for bitwise operators & | ^ &= |= ^= to the "infinint"
  type.
- Clarifies the code that implements the legacy make_ivec algorithm.
- Adds a small self-test when running in blowfish2 mode.

Separate patch files that apply against dar 2.3.2, 2.3.3, and today's CVS
are included.

Cheers,
- Dwayne

Footnotes:

[1] Specifically, using the password-based key derivation function (PBKDF2)
as described in RSA PKCS#5 v2.0.  The attached code uses an empty salt,
2000 iterations, and HMAC-SHA1 as the underlying pseudorandom function.
Note that although we're using HMAC-SHA1, it's only used for generating the
Blowfish key; The new code still does not provide any strong integrity
guarantees.

[2] ESSIV is also used in the LUKS harddisk encryption software.  It was
designed by Clemens Fruhwirth to provide security against a watermarking
attack.
