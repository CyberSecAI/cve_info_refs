Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `cat_id` parameter of the `directory.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, enabling attackers to manipulate database queries.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information, including email addresses and passwords of users who have posted URLs within the directory.
    *   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Although the exploit notes that admin information doesn't seem to be stored directly in the database, the vulnerability could be a stepping stone for further attacks if the attacker can access configuration files or other sensitive system data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request targeting the `directory.php` script, specifically manipulating the `cat_id` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
    *   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:**  The attacker must be able to craft a malicious SQL injection payload.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit example is:

```
http://www.site.com/directory.php?ax=list&sub=1&cat_id=-1/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,4,concat(0x2D2D3E,email,0x3a,password),6,7,8,9,10,0x223E3C212D2D,12,13/**/from/**/links/*
```

This exploit utilizes a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the `email` and `password` fields from the `links` table. The `concat()` function is used to combine the retrieved data. The SQL injection is possible due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `cat_id` parameter.
