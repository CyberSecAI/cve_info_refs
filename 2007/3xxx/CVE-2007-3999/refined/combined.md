How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

nfs-utils-lib security update (RHSA-2007-0913)

Original Release Date: October 4, 2007

Last Revised: December 19, 2008

Number: ASA-2007-396

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The nfs-utils-lib package contains support libraries that are needed
by the
commands and daemons of the nfs-utils package.

A stack buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the RPC
library used by nfs-utils-lib. A remote unauthenticated attacker who can
access an application linked against nfs-utils-lib could exploit this
vulnerability and cause the application to crash. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name [CVE-2007-3999](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3999) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0913.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with nfs-utils-lib installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | Customers should upgrade to IALX 2.0 SP2. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.x, 4.0 | Low | customers running MSS 3.x should upgrade to MSS 3.1 SP4 or later. Customers running MSS 4.0 should install MSS 4.0 SP1. |
| Avaya AES | AES 3.1.3 | Low | Customers should upgrade to AES 3.1.4 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable versions of
nfs-utils-lib, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as the updgrade can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or

often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

kadmind uninitialized pointer
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C
See DETAILS for the expanded CVSSv2 metrics for this vulnerability.
SUMMARY
=======
This advisory concerns two vulnerabilities. CVE-2007-3999 is much
easier to exploit than CVE-2007-4000.
[CVE-2007-3999]
The MIT krb5 Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) is vulnerable to
a stack buffer overflow in the RPCSEC\_GSS authentication flavor of the
RPC library. Third-party applications using the RPC library provided
with MIT krb5 may also be affected.
We have received a proof-of-concept exploit that does not appear to
execute malicious code, and we believe that this exploit is not
publicly circulated.
This is a bug in the RPC library in MIT krb5. It is not a bug in the
Kerberos protocol.
[CVE-2007-4000]
The MIT krb5 Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) can write data
through an uninitialized pointer. We know of no working exploit code
for this vulnerability, and do not believe that any exploit code for
this vulnerability is circulating.
This is a bug in the kadmind in MIT krb5. It is not a bug in the
Kerberos protocol.
IMPACT
======
[CVE-2007-3999] An unauthenticated remote user may be able to cause a
host running kadmind to execute arbitrary code.
[CVE-2007-4000] An authenticated user with "modify policy" privilege
may be able to cause a host running kadmind to execute arbitrary code.
Successful exploitation of either vulnerability can compromise the
Kerberos key database and host security on the KDC host. (kadmind
typically runs as root.) Unsuccessful exploitation attempts will
likely result in kadmind crashing.
Third-party applications calling the RPC library provided with MIT
krb5 may be vulnerable to CVE-2007-3999.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
[CVE-2007-3999]
\* kadmind in MIT releases krb5-1.4 through krb5-1.6.2
\* third-party RPC server programs linked against the RPC library
included in MIT releases krb5-1.4 through krb5-1.6.2
\* MIT releases prior to krb5-1.4 did not contain the vulnerable code
[CVE-2007-4000]
\* kadmind in MIT releases krb5-1.5 through krb5-1.6.2
\* MIT releases prior to krb5-1.5 did not contain the vulnerable code
FIXES
=====
\* The patch for CVE-2007-3999 has been revised; the patch originally
released for svc\_auth\_gss.c allowed a 32-byte overflow. Depending
on the compilation environment and machine architecture, this may or
may not be a significant continued vulnerability. The new patch
below correctly checks the buffer length.
\* The upcoming krb5-1.6.3 release, as well as the upcoming krb5-1.5.5
maintenance release, will contain fixes for this vulnerability.
Prior to that release you may apply the following patch. Note that
releases prior to krb5-1.5 will not need the svr\_policy.c patch.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============
Thanks to Kevin Coffman (UMich), Will Fiveash (Sun), and Nico Williams
(Sun) for discovering the bug in the initial CVE-2007-3999 patch and
for help with developing the revised patch for CVE-2007-3999.
CVE-2007-3999 was discovered by Tenable Network Security and reported
to MIT Kerberos Team by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) of the
TippingPoint division of 3Com.
CVE-2007-4000 was discovered by Garrett Wollman of MIT CSAIL.
DETAILS
=======
[CVE-2007-3999]
The implementation of the RPCSEC\_GSS authentication flavor copies
untrusted data having an inadequately-validated length into a buffer
on the stack. In the function svcauth\_gss\_validate() in
src/lib/rpc/svc\_auth\_gss.c, which authenticates the incoming RPC
message, a memcpy() invocation copies a number of bytes into the
128-byte stack buffer "rpchdr". The length provided to this memcpy()
invocation comes from the RPC header and may be maliciously chosen.
The invocation of xdr\_callmsg(), which provides the decoded rpc\_msg
structure used by svcauth\_gss\_validate(), ensures that the provided
length does not exceed MAX\_AUTH\_BYTES, which is 400, but destination
buffer is smaller than this size, and can be trivially overflowed.
The vulnerable code executes prior to the completion of authentication
of the RPC message, and therefore requires no authentication to
exploit.
Exploitation of stack buffer overflows is trivial on many platforms.
[CVE-2007-4000]
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C
CVSSv2 Base Score: 7.1
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: High
Authentication: Single
Confidentiality Impact: Complete
Integrity Impact: Complete
Availability Impact: Complete
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 5.6
Exploitability: Proof-of-Concept
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
The function kadm5\_modify\_policy\_internal() in
src/lib/kadm5/srv/svr\_policy.c, does not check return values from
krb5\_db\_get\_policy() correctly. When the policy does not exist,
krb5\_db\_get\_policy() returns zero but sets the count retrieved records
to zero without initializing the output pointer. Subsequent code in
kadm5\_modify\_policy\_internal() can attempt to write data through this
pointer, causing memory corruption.
This vulnerability was not present in MIT releases prior to krb5-1.5.
In the krb5-1.5 release, changes related to the implementation of the
Database Abstraction Layer introduced this vulnerability.

## MIT Kerberos 5 kadmind buffer overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#883632

Original Release Date: 2007-09-04 | Last Revised: 2007-11-15

---

### Overview

An unspecified vulnerability in MIT Kerberos kadmind server may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| Kerberos is a network authentication system that uses a trusted third party to authenticate clients and servers to each other. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. MIT Kerberos code is used in network applications from a variety of different vendors and is included in many UNIX and Linux distributions. The kadmind daemon is the administration server that runs on the master Kerberos server.  From the kadmind manual page:*This command starts the KADM5 administration server. The administration server runs on the master Kerberos server, which stores the KDC principal database and the KADM5 policy database. Kadmind accepts remote requests to administer the information--exclude in these databases. Remote requests are sent, for example, by kadmin(8) and the kpasswd(1) command, both of which are clients of kadmind.*Per [MITKRB5-SA-2007-006](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2007-006.txt) there is a stack buffer overflow in the RPCSEC\_GSS authentication in the RPC library that is included in krb5-1.4 through krb5-1.6.2. Any programs that link against the RPC library may also be affected. Note that per MITKRB5-SA-2007-006, versions of kerberos prior to krb5-1.5 are not affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**The Kerberos team has released an update to address this issue. Please see [MITKRB5-SA-2007-006](http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2007-006.txt) for more information on obtaining fixed software. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Restricng network access to the Kerberos server may partially mitigate this vulnerability. kadmind listens on 749/tcp by default. |

# RPCSEC\_GSS library: Buffer overflow — GLSA **200710-01**

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in librpcsecgss.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/librpcsecgss** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.16** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.16** |

### Background

librpcsecgss is an implementation of RPCSEC\_GSS for secure RPC
communications.

### Description

A stack based buffer overflow has been discovered in the
svcauth\_gss\_validate() function in file lib/rpc/svc\_auth\_gss.c when
processing an overly long string in a RPC message.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted RPC request to an
application relying on this library, e.g NFSv4 or Kerberos
(GLSA-200709-01), resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All librpcsecgss users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/librpcsecgss-0.16"
```

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Advisory Details

September 12th, 2007
## Multiple Kerberos Implementations Authentication Context Stack Overflow Vulnerability

### ZDI-07-052ZDI-CAN-208

| CVE ID | [CVE-2007-3999](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-3999) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE |  |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | MIT |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Kerberos |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['5503']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of MIT Kerberos. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists in the svcauth\_gss\_validate() function. By sending a large authentication context over RPC, a stack based buffer overflow occurs, resulting in a situation allowing for remote code execution.  The vulnerable line of the function is:  memcpy((caddr\_t)buf, oa->oa\_base, oa->oa\_length);  If 128 < oa->oa\_length < 400, the exploitable situation occurs. Over 400 bytes is caught during a separate check for MAX\_AUTH\_SIZE earlier in the RPC packet decoding process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | MIT has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/MITKRB5-SA-2007-006.txt> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2007-07-20 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2007-09-12 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

# MIT Kerberos 5: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200709-01**

Two vulnerabilities have been found in MIT Kerberos 5, which could allow a
remote unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/mit-krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.3-r1** |

### Background

MIT Kerberos 5 is a suite of applications that implement the Kerberos
network protocol. kadmind is the MIT Kerberos 5 administration daemon.

### Description

A stack buffer overflow (CVE-2007-3999) has been reported in
svcauth\_gss\_validate() of the RPC library of kadmind. Another
vulnerability (CVE-2007-4000) has been found in
kadm5\_modify\_policy\_internal(), which does not check the return values
of krb5\_db\_get\_policy() correctly.

### Impact

The RPC related vulnerability can be exploited by a remote
unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges
on the host running kadmind. The second vulnerability requires the
remote attacker to be authenticated and to have "modify policy"
privileges. It could then also allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MIT Kerberos 5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.5.3-r1"
```

See DETAILS for the expanded CVSSv2 metrics for this vulnerability.
SUMMARY
=======
This advisory concerns two vulnerabilities. CVE-2007-3999 is much
easier to exploit than CVE-2007-4000.
[CVE-2007-3999]
The MIT krb5 Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) is vulnerable to
a stack buffer overflow in the RPCSEC\_GSS authentication flavor of the
RPC library. Third-party applications using the RPC library provided
with MIT krb5 may also be affected.
We have received a proof-of-concept exploit that does not appear to
execute malicious code, and we believe that this exploit is not
publicly circulated.
This is a bug in the RPC library in MIT krb5. It is not a bug in the
Kerberos protocol.
[CVE-2007-4000]
The MIT krb5 Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) can write data
through an uninitialized pointer. We know of no working exploit code
for this vulnerability, and do not believe that any exploit code for
this vulnerability is circulating.
This is a bug in the kadmind in MIT krb5. It is not a bug in the
Kerberos protocol.
IMPACT
======
[CVE-2007-3999] An unauthenticated remote user may be able to cause a
host running kadmind to execute arbitrary code.
[CVE-2007-4000] An authenticated user with "modify policy" privilege
may be able to cause a host running kadmind to execute arbitrary code.
Successful exploitation of either vulnerability can compromise the
Kerberos key database and host security on the KDC host. (kadmind
typically runs as root.) Unsuccessful exploitation attempts will
likely result in kadmind crashing.
Third-party applications calling the RPC library provided with MIT
krb5 may be vulnerable to CVE-2007-3999.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
[CVE-2007-3999]

CVE-2007-3999 was discovered by Tenable Network Security and reported
to MIT Kerberos Team by the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) of the
TippingPoint division of 3Com.
CVE-2007-4000 was discovered by Garrett Wollman of MIT CSAIL.
DETAILS
=======
[CVE-2007-3999]
The implementation of the RPCSEC\_GSS authentication flavor copies
untrusted data having an inadequately-validated length into a buffer
on the stack. In the function svcauth\_gss\_validate() in
src/lib/rpc/svc\_auth\_gss.c, which authenticates the incoming RPC
message, a memcpy() invocation copies a number of bytes into the
128-byte stack buffer "rpchdr". The length provided to this memcpy()
invocation comes from the RPC header and may be maliciously chosen.
The invocation of xdr\_callmsg(), which provides the decoded rpc\_msg
structure used by svcauth\_gss\_validate(), ensures that the provided
length does not exceed MAX\_AUTH\_BYTES, which is 400, but destination
buffer is smaller than this size, and can be trivially overflowed.
The vulnerable code executes prior to the completion of authentication
of the RPC message, and therefore requires no authentication to
exploit.
Exploitation of stack buffer overflows is trivial on many platforms.

Exploitability: Proof-of-Concept
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
The function kadm5\_modify\_policy\_internal() in
src/lib/kadm5/srv/svr\_policy.c, does not check return values from
krb5\_db\_get\_policy() correctly. When the policy does not exist,
krb5\_db\_get\_policy() returns zero but sets the count retrieved records
to zero without initializing the output pointer. Subsequent code in
kadm5\_modify\_policy\_internal() can attempt to write data through this
pointer, causing memory corruption.
This vulnerability was not present in MIT releases prior to krb5-1.5.
In the krb5-1.5 release, changes related to the implementation of the
Database Abstraction Layer introduced this vulnerability.

Will be public on 04 September 2007, at 14:00 US/Eastern time.  This issue has not been triaged as it may well affect recent RHEL distributions with a different severity (flaw type is likely caught by fortify_source)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=250973#c3)  Mark J. Cox    2007-08-06 09:24:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 160738](attachment.cgi?id=160738&action=diff "proposed patch from MIT") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=160738&action=edit "proposed patch from MIT") proposed patch from MIT   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=250973#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2007-08-28 06:13:55 UTC  ``` Update from MIT Kerberos team:  We have discovered that the server-side code in nfs-utils is also vulnerable to [CVE-2007-3999](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-3999).  If you are distributing nfs-utils or some derivative, you may care about this.  According to Kevin Coffman of the University of Michigan, nfs-utils is probably not vulnerable because it does not actually execute any server-side RPC code.  We are working to confirm this assertion, but note that third-party server applications that link with the RPC library in nfs-utils may be vulnerable to [CVE-2007-3999](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-3999).    ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=250973#c9)  Mark J.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# MIT Kerberos 5: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200709-01**

Two vulnerabilities have been found in MIT Kerberos 5, which could allow a
remote unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-crypt/mit-krb5** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.3-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.3-r1** |

### Background

MIT Kerberos 5 is a suite of applications that implement the Kerberos
network protocol. kadmind is the MIT Kerberos 5 administration daemon.

### Description

A stack buffer overflow (CVE-2007-3999) has been reported in
svcauth\_gss\_validate() of the RPC library of kadmind. Another
vulnerability (CVE-2007-4000) has been found in
kadm5\_modify\_policy\_internal(), which does not check the return values
of krb5\_db\_get\_policy() correctly.

### Impact

The RPC related vulnerability can be exploited by a remote
unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges
on the host running kadmind. The second vulnerability requires the
remote attacker to be authenticated and to have "modify policy"
privileges. It could then also allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MIT Kerberos 5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/mit-krb5-1.5.3-r1"
```

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0913)

## Topic

An updated nfs-utils-lib package to correct a security flaw is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having important security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The nfs-utils-lib package contains support libraries that are needed by the
commands and daemons of the nfs-utils package.

Tenable Network Security discovered a stack buffer overflow flaw in the RPC
library used by nfs-utils-lib. A remote unauthenticated attacker who can
access an application linked against nfs-utils-lib could trigger this flaw
and cause the application to crash. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 it is not
possible to exploit this flaw to run arbitrary code as the overflow is
blocked by FORTIFY\_SOURCE. (CVE-2007-3999)

Users of nfs-utils-lib are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
which contains a backported patch that resolves this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : librpcsecgss
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-3999

It was discovered that a buffer overflow of the library for secure RPC
communication over the rpcsec_gss protocol allows the execution of
arbitrary code.

The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain librpcsecgss.

For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.14-2etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your librpcsecgss packages.
