Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-3449:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `newsid` parameter of the `member.php` script within the 6ALBlog application. This vulnerability arises from improper sanitization of user input before using it in a database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection which allows attackers to manipulate database queries by injecting malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this to extract sensitive data from the database, such as usernames, password hashes, and potentially other confidential information by using `UNION SELECT` to access data from different tables.
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The advisory also mentions a remote file inclusion vulnerability, which can be exploited after gaining admin access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `member.php` file, manipulating the `newsid` parameter.
- **Dork:** The advisory mentions `inurl:"member.php?page=comments` as a dork which can be used to identify vulnerable installations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote; no specific system access is required.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs the capability to send and manipulate HTTP GET requests.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must identify the `newsid` parameter as the vulnerable entry point.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory provides example exploit URLs demonstrating how to extract user and password hashes.
- The advisory also indicates the presence of a remote file inclusion vulnerability that can be used after gaining admin access through the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The Exploit-DB entry links CVE-2007-3449 with CVE-2007-3450 and CVE-2007-3451 which suggests they are related vulnerabilities in the same application.
