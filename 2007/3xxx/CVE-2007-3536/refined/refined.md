```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the AMX Corp. VNC ActiveX control (AmxVnc.dll 1.0.13.0). This occurs when excessively long strings are passed to the `Host`, `Password`, or `LogFile` properties of the ActiveX control.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow. The ActiveX control does not properly validate the length of the input strings.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by crafting a malicious HTML page that exploits the vulnerability.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered by a remote user visiting a specially crafted HTML page containing the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to visit a malicious website under their control. The attacker can then deliver the crafted exploit. The attacker also needs to be able to bypass any security measures preventing execution of the ActiveX control.
