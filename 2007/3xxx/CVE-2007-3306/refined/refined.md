{
  "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize the `config['include_dir']` parameter passed to `run_billing.php`, leading to a remote file inclusion vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Remote File Inclusion (RFI)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a malicious remote file into the application, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL to the vulnerable `run_billing.php` script with a modified `config['include_dir']` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server and have a malicious script hosted on a server accessible to the vulnerable application."
