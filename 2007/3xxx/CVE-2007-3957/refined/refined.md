Root cause of vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Xserver 0.1 Alpha due to insufficient bounds checking when handling POST requests.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation when processing data from a POST request. The server fails to limit the amount of data copied into a buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

Impact of exploitation: The vulnerability allows for a remote denial of service (DoS). By sending a specially crafted POST request with a large amount of data, an attacker can overwrite memory on the stack, leading to a crash of the server.

Attack vectors: The attack vector is remote. An attacker can send a malicious POST request to the vulnerable server over the network.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required. The attacker only needs to know the IP address or domain name of the vulnerable server.
