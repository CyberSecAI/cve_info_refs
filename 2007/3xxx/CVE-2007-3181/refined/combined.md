Debian Bug(s)  : 362001 432753 444976 441405 460048 463596

Multiple security problems have been discovered in the Firebird database,
which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.

This Debian security advisory is a bit unusual. While it's normally
our strict policy to backport security bugfixes to older releases, this
turned out to be infeasible for Firebird 1.5 due to large infrastructural
changes necessary to fix these issues. As a consequence security support
for Firebird 1.5 is hereby discontinued, leaving two options to
administrators running a Firebird database:

I.  Administrators running Firebird in a completely internal setup with
    trusted users could leave it unchanged.

II. Everyone else should upgrade to the firebird2.0 packages available at
    <http://www.backports.org/backports.org/pool/main/f/firebird2.0/>

    Version 2.0.3.12981.ds1-6~bpo40+1 fixes all known issues.

    Please refer to the general backports.org documentation to add the
    packages to your package management configuration:
    <http://www.backports.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=instructions>

    These packages are backported to run with Debian stable. Since
    firebird2.0 is not a drop-in replacement for firebird2 (which
    is the source package name for the Firebird 1.5 packages)
    these updates are not released through security.debian.org.
    Potential future security problems affecting Debian stable will be
    released through backports.org as well.

    Arrangements have been made to ensure that Firebird in the upcoming
    Debian 5.0 release will be supportable with regular backported
    security bugfixes again.

For a more detailed descriptions of the security problems, please refer
to the entries in the Debian Bug Tracking System referenced above and
the following URLs:

# Firebird: Buffer overflow â€” GLSA **200707-01**

A vulnerability has been discovered in Firebird, allowing for the execution
of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-db/firebird** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.1** |

### Background

Firebird is an open source relational database that runs on Linux,
Windows, and various UNIX systems.

### Description

Cody Pierce from TippingPoint DVLabs has discovered a buffer overflow
when processing "connect" requests with an overly large "p\_cnct\_count"
value.

### Impact

An unauthenticated remote attacker could send a specially crafted
request to a vulnerable server, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firebird.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Firebird users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/firebird-2.0.1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-12 18:42:11 UTC  ``` Cody Pierce has reported a vulnerability in Firebird, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.  The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the handling of "connect" requests (0x1) with a large "p_cnct_count" value. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow by sending a specially crafted connect request to a vulnerable server (default port 3050/TCP).  The vulnerability is reported in Firebird 2. Other versions may also be affected.  SOLUTION: Update to version 2.0.1. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-12 18:44:32 UTC  ``` setting status and cc'ing maintainers. I see that there is a 2.0.1 in the tree, is it ok for going stable? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  William L. Thomson Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-12 19:11:07 UTC  ``` I have not switched to 2.0.1 on my production systems yet. Mainly due to a character set issue. Another user helped out with that, and I committed the changes last night. Really just needs testing.  That and I need to modify the pkg_config or etc stuff to deal with backing up and restoring the security.gdb -> security2.gdb. Which the meta has to be updated modified first. A sql script is provided. I just need to modify that to call it before it backs up and restores. Or in that process.  Beyond that, testing, baring any bugs should be good to go for stabilization. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-13 19:06:56 UTC  ``` William, I'm not sure wether that was a yes or no :)  Are these changes essential for successful user upgrades or should we just go ahead and test the current version? The issue looks pretty serious. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  William L. Thomson Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-13 19:17:04 UTC  ``` If you want a clear yes or no, it would likely be no for now. One way around that is to get rid of pkg_config, and leave backing/restoring/migrating the security.fdb -> security2.fdb entirely to the user.  So it's kinda up to personal preference as to what is essential for a user. However upstream pushes everyone toward 2.0.x anyway. I myself have no problems with going ahead, testing and stabilizing 2.0.x.  I believe their could be a problem with the user created log file symlink or etc. That is also done in pkg_config, in past ebuilds. In 2.0.1 I moved that to src_install so firebird can start upon install out of the box. Just need to remove that from 2.0.1's pkg_config.  Other than those two things, which depending on the person can be moot or major. We should be good to go for stabilizing and testing.  So with that, let's go ahead and look to test and stabilize per the security issue. I will address what ever I need to during that process. If and when those issues or others surface.  Began with a NO, ending with a YES. Confused yet :) ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-13 19:20:47 UTC  ``` YES. Please make sure that there proper upgrade instructions/warnings :)  Arches please test and mark firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r3 stable.   ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2007-06-13 21:14:23 UTC  ``` dev-db/firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r3  USE="doc examples -debug -xinetd" 1. emerges on x86, I am not shure if this is a problem: >>> Install firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r3 into /var/tmp/portage/dev-db/firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r3/image/ category dev-db install: omitting directory `examples/api' bzip2: Can't open input file /var/tmp/portage/dev-db/firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r3/image/usr/share/doc/firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r3/examples/api: No such file or directory. ...  2. passes collision test 3. dev-db/flamerobin-0.7.6 emerges with it 4. seems to work   Portage 2.1.2.7 (default-linux/x86/2007.0/desktop, gcc-4.1.2, glibc-2.5-r3, 2.6.20.14 i686) ================================================================= System uname: 2.6.20.14 i686 Genuine Intel(R) CPU T2300 @ 1.66GHz Gentoo Base System release 1.12.9 Timestamp of tree: Wed, 13 Jun 2007 19:30:01 +0000 dev-java/java-config: 1.3.7, 2.0.32 dev-lang/python:     2.3.5-r3, 2.4.4-r4 dev-python/pycrypto: 2.0.1-r5 sys-apps/sandbox:    1.2.17 sys-devel/autoconf:  2.13, 2.61 sys-devel/automake:  1.4_p6, 1.5, 1.6.3, 1.7.9-r1, 1.8.5-r3, 1.9.6-r2, 1.10 sys-devel/binutils:  2.16.1-r3 sys-devel/gcc-config: 1.3.16 sys-devel/libtool:   1.5.22 virtual/os-headers:  2.6.17-r2 ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="x86" AUTOCLEAN="yes" CBUILD="i686-pc-linux-gnu" CFLAGS="-O2 -march=prescott -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer" CHOST="i686-pc-linux-gnu" CONFIG_PROTECT="/etc /usr/kde/3.5/env /usr/kde/3.5/share/config /usr/kde/3.5/shutdown /usr/share/X11/xkb /usr/share/config" CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK="/etc/env.d /etc/env.d/java/ /etc/gconf /etc/php/apache2-php5/ext-active/ /etc/php/cgi-php5/ext-active/ /etc/php/cli-php5/ext-active/ /etc/revdep-rebuild /etc/terminfo /etc/texmf/web2c" CXXFLAGS="-O2 -march=prescott -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer" DISTDIR="/usr/portage/distfiles" EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS="--nospinner" FEATURES="collision-protect distlocks metadata-transfer parallel-fetch sandbox sfperms strict test userfetch userpriv usersandbox" GENTOO_MIRRORS="<http://mirror.switch.ch/mirror/gentoo/> <http://gentoo.inode.at/>" LINGUAS="en de en_GB de_CH" MAKEOPTS="-j3" PKGDIR="/usr/portage/packages" PORTAGE_RSYNC_OPTS="--recursive --links --safe-links --perms --times --compress --force --whole-file --delete --delete-after --stats --timeout=180 --exclude=/distfiles --exclude=/local --exclude=/packages --filter=H_**/files/digest-*" PORTAGE_TMPDIR="/var/tmp" PORTDIR="/usr/portage" SYNC="rsync://rsync.gentoo.org/gentoo-portage" USE="X a52 aac acl acpi alsa apache2 asf avahi berkdb bitmap-fonts cairo cdr cdrom cli cracklib crypt cups dbus divx dri dts dvd dvdr dvdread eds emboss encode evo fam ffmpeg firefox flac fortran gdbm gif gnome gpm gstreamer gtk hal iconv ipv6 isdnlog java jpeg kde kdeenablefinal kerberos ldap libg++ mad midi mikmod mmx mono mp3 mpeg mudflap ncurses nls nptl nptlonly ogg opengl openmp oss pam pcre pdf perl png pppd python qt3 qt3support qt4 quicktime readline reflection rtsp ruby samba sdl session smp spell spl sse sse2 sse3 ssl svg tcpd test tetex theora threads tiff truetype truetype-fonts type1-fonts unicode vcd vorbis wifi win32codecs wxwindows x264 x86 xine xml xorg xprint xv xvid zlib" ELIBC="glibc" INPUT_DEVICES="keyboard mouse" KERNEL="linux" LINGUAS="en de en_GB de_CH" USERLAND="GNU" VIDEO_CARDS="i810 fbdev vesa" Unset:  CTARGET, INSTALL_MASK, LANG, LC_ALL, LDFLAGS, PORTAGE_COMPRESS, PORTAGE_COMPRESS_FLAGS, PORTAGE_RSYNC_EXTRA_OPTS, PORTDIR_OVERLAY ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  William L.

I do have one other change I need to make to pkg_config, wrt to security.fdb -> security2.fdb. Will try to address that tomorrow/today. It's getting a bit late now. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  William L. Thomson Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-14 04:45:02 UTC  ``` There is some minor QT stuff that needs addressing before we stabilize. That will cause stable packages to break. Not sure if those QT packages will need to go stable. If we have a fix in ~arch that's good enough for now, and QT can be stabilized on it's own time frame. Up to you all there. Added bug as a dependency of this one. It will cause qt to fail when firebird use flag is set on 64bit systems. But that can also be address with a use flag mask or etc in lieu of a rush qt stabilization. ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Ferris McCormick (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-14 12:59:12 UTC  ``` No for sparc:  After adding the required libedit package, the firebird build fails with a bus error, thus. ========================================== make[3]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/dev-db/firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r4/work/Firebird-2.0.1.12855-0/gen' make -f ../gen/Makefile.refDatabases empty_db make[3]: Entering directory `/var/tmp/portage/dev-db/firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r4/work/Firebird-2.0.1.12855-0/gen' make -f ../gen/Makefile.embed.util ../gen/firebird/bin/create_db make[4]: Entering directory `/var/tmp/portage/dev-db/firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r4/work/Firebird-2.0.1.12855-0/gen' make[4]: `../gen/firebird/bin/create_db' is up to date. make[4]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/dev-db/firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r4/work/Firebird-2.0.1.12855-0/gen' rm -f empty.fdb ../gen/firebird/bin/create_db empty.fdb make[3]: *** [empty.fdb] Bus error make[3]: *** Deleting file `empty.fdb' make[3]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/dev-db/firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r4/work/Firebird-2.0.1.12855-0/gen' make[2]: *** [empty_db] Error 2 make[2]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/dev-db/firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r4/work/Firebird-2.0.1.12855-0/gen' make[1]: *** [../gen/firebird/security2.fdb] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/portage/dev-db/firebird-2.0.1.12855.0-r4/work/Firebird-2.0.1.12855-0/gen' make: *** [firebird] Error 2 =================================== On sparc, this means create_db tried to use a misaligned pointer.

Thomson Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-21 05:42:54 UTC  ``` Ok I have dropped firebird 1.5.x down to -sparc. So we should be good to go now to stabilize firebird on amd64 and x86.  There are still some Debian patches I would like to introduce. And some other refinements. I would likely consider all that enhancements. But we will find out as we stabilize. I am sure if there are problems users or testers will let us know. I will respond to any bugs that come up after stabilization ASAP.  Still need to make a change in pkg_config wrt to backing up/restoring security.fdb -> security2.fdb.  Rest of pkg_config should be fine. Although I am pretty sure no one is using that.

Not really a compiling error, but one that is happening during the building/compiling of Firebird. Never seen that before. Let me see if I can replicate on my production amd64 firebird server. I had planned up upgrading that tomorrow. Not sure if I can squeeze it in today. ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Christoph Mende (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-23 19:48:54 UTC  ``` that was inside a chroot, it compiles fine outside of it - both systems differ pretty much though ```  [Comment 21](#c21)  William L. Thomson Jr. (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-06-23 19:56:37 UTC  ``` Yeah that was failure to make a network request to the engine.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
