How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Feature Truncation for Nameserver
    fixes rt.cpan.org #33547 and #42744

    TAKE CARE:
    this feature may cause unexpected behavior for your nameservers
    and can be turned off by setting Truncate to 0 during the creation
    of the nameserver.
    my $ns = Net::DNS::Nameserver->new(
		Truncate => 0,

    );

    Net::DNS::Packet::truncate is a new method that is called from
    within Net::DNS::Nameserver that truncates a packet according to
    the rules of RFC2181 section 9.

    Acknowledgement Aaron Crane for an elegant test and for
    inspiration for a direction.

Feature: Added Net::DNS::Domain
    Net::DNS::Domain is an attempt to introduce a consistent model
    for representation of RFC 1035 s.

    The class and its test script t/02-domain.t are included to be
    exposed to various architectures.

    The class and its methods may be subject to change, both in terms of
    naming and functionality.

    One liner added to not continue UDP processing when that happens.

Feature KX RR

    Added support for the KX RR, RFC2230
    The implementation is trivial since the KX inherits almost all of
    its functionality by inheritance from the MX RR.

Fix NSAP RR string representation

    RFC1706 specifies the masterfile format to have a leading "0x" and
    optional dot. This was not how the RR was represented with the
    rdatastr method (and hence string and print).

Fix AAAA dynamic update

    Dynamic update of AAAA caused FORMERR on the prerequisite caused
    by AAAA creating rdata even when an address was never specified.
    This fix may cause difference in behavior for people who expect
    a NULL address ("::") when creating a AAAA without an address
    specified.

Feature HIP RR

    Added support for the HIP RR, RFC5205
    perldoc Net::DNS::RR::HIP for more information.

Feature DHCID RR
    Added rudimentary support for the DHCID RR.

Fix rt.cpan.org #50883

   Improved error reporting during client disconnect from the nameserver

NOTE rt.cpan.org # 40249

   Release 0.62 introduced a feature to parse data inside a packet only
   when needed. This can cause the following to happen:

   Exception: corrupt or incomplete data at
                     /usr/lib/perl5/Net/DNS/RR.pm line 510.
   caught at -e line 1

   This may happen when you have undefined your packet data before all the
   sections have been fully parsed. Such as in:

   $packet = Net::DNS::Packet->new(\$data);
   undef($data);

   The workaround is to force parsing by calling the methods that
   parse the data. e.g.

   $packet = Net::DNS::Packet->new(\$data);
   $packet->answer; $packet->additional; $packet->authority;
   undef ($data)

Fix rt.cpan.org # 41076 and # 41071

  Net::DNS::RR->new_from_hash function would not normalize the content
  of the data so that a method getting a string representation would
  get inconsistent results depending on whether a RR was created from

  Buggy setting of "Recursion too deep, aborted" corrected.

Feature (rt.cpan.org #39284)

  The ReplyHandler now also receives a variable with an anonymous hash with the connection details. Variables
  supplied to the Reply handler are:  $qname, $qclass, $qtype, $peerhost, $query, $conn
  The hash referenced by $conn contains the following buckets: sockhost, sockport,  peerhost, and peerport.

Feature t/08-online.t and t/10-recurse.t

  In particular environments a query for a.t. will resolve and or
  middleboxes will replace DNS packet content for queries to the root.
  A bunch of test is skipped when this (broken) environment is
  detected.

Feature/Bug rt.cpan.org #22019

  The initial fix for rt 22019 was to strip a trailing dot from all
  attributes that were provided as argument for the
  Net::DNS::RR::new_from_hash function.  We have introduced
  Net::DNS::stripdot, a function that will strip the dots of domain
  names, taking into account possible escapes (e.g. labels like
  foo\\\..).  As a side effect the new_from_string method will now
  convert possible spaces that are not trapped by some of the
  new_from_string functions and convert them to \032 escapes.

  For information: The internal storage of domain names is using
  presentation format without trailing dots.

Bug
  @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK moved to a BEGIN block so that Net::DNS::SEC
  can make use of exported functions

Feature/Bug

  The Notify handler introduced in 0.63 did not set the OPCODE on the
  reply appropriately. This has been solved generically by allowing the
  "Headermask" that is returned as 4th element by the reply or notify
  handler in the nameserver also allows for the opcode to be set.
  e.g. as in return ("NXDOMAIN",[],[],[],{ opcode => "NS_NOTIFY_OP" }
  );

*** 0.63, 8 Feb 2008

This version contains a Security Fix.

Feature NotifyHandler in Nameserver

  The NotifyHandler is a new attribute to the nameserver used in the
  same way as the ReplyHandler except that it is executed when the
  opcode is NS_NOTIFY (RFC1996). It takes the same arguments as the
  reply handler (i.e. $qname, $qclass, $qtype, $peerhost, and $query).
  Corrections made in the documentation.

  parsing routines are now enclosed in eval blocks to trap exception
  and avoid premature termination of user program.

Bug: mbox-dname and txt-dname were not allowed to be empty in the RP RR.
   Fix by Peter Koch

*** 0.62, 28 December 2007

Features: Move of some functionality out of the Packet to the Question
   and RR classes; parsing of elements in the packet is now performed
   by calling the appropriate subclasses.

   New methods were introduced:
   * Net::DNS::Packet->parse()
   * Net::DNS::RR->parse()
   * Net::DNS::Question->parse()

   The Packet class now defers parsing of authority/additional until
   their content is really needed. This should cause a bit of
   performance improvement.

   Dick Franks is acknowledged for this Good Work (TM).

   Added 20081216 see NOTE above under  rt.cpan.org # 40249

Feature: the Net::DNS::Packet's answersize() method will from now on
    ignore its arguments and just return the size of the packet.

Feature: The Net::DNS::RR->new() method used to call
    Net::DNS::RR->new_from_data() whenever called with the appropriate
    combination of arguments. That (undocumented) behavior has been deprecated.
    Use Net::DNS::RR->new_from_data() directly if you depended on that.

Feature: Net::DNS::Packets unique_push now ignores the TTL in
    comparison of uniqueness, this is closer to the intent of
    RFC2181, but not yet fully compliant.

Feature check_soa test of NCACHE TTL
    Dick Franks supplied an improved version of check_soa script which
    performs a direct test of NCACHE TTL by looking up non-existent name and
    reporting value if it exceeds 86400. Test is skipped unless minimumTTL is
    above same threshold.  Recent BIND implementations impose a ceiling on
    NCACHE TTLs internally, so a large minimumTTL value is unlikely to have
    damaging consequences at many sites.

Feature Support for IPSECKEY RR
    Rudimentary IPSECKEY RR support added.

Fix rt.cpan.org  #25342
    HINFO would only accept its data fields within quotes. That has now
    been fixed to adhere to  by inheriting parsing functions

Fix rt.cpan.org #24631 / Feature IP address prefix notation
    Dick Franks supplied a cleaned up version of Question.pm.

    Revised code deals with incomplete IPv6 address bug and accepts RFC4291
    address prefix notation. IPv4/prefix also supported for completeness.

    This involved a minor change to the API for reverse IP lookup.  Changing
    qtype to PTR is now performed for A and AAAA only.  This allows queries
    for NS and SOA records at interior nodes to be specified using the address
    prefix.  Type ANY queries now also produce the expected result.

    Cleaned up TYPE/CLASS reversal code, exploiting fact that the intersection
    of the sets of class and type names contains only one member (ANY).

    Minor cleanup of remaining code.

Fix rt.cpan.org #22019

Fix Recursion and EDNS OPT record

    The Recursive resolver process would add an OPT-RR with each recursion
    which causes FORMERRs with a number of authoritative servers.

Feature SSHFP warn instead of die

    We do not die if a not implemented fingerprint type value is read
    from the wire, instead we 'warn' and return undef.

Feature NSEC3PARAM hook

    A hook to load NSEC3PARAM when available has been added.
    WARNING: Both NSEC3 and NSEC3PARAM are configured with their
    experimental type codes.

Feature rt r24525

    Net::DNS::Resolver depended on Net::IP (2268 Kb) which depends on
    heavy module Math::BigInt (1780 Kb). Valery Studennikov suggested to
    ship Net::DNS::Resolver::Base with its own copies of ip_is_ipv[4|6] and
    supplied a patch with those functions stripped from Net::IP.

    Note that the package still depends on Net::IP because
    Net::DNS::Nameserver and a few tests depend on it.

*** 0.59 September 18, 2006

Fix rt.cpan.org 20836, 20857, 20994, and 21402

    These tickets all revolved around proper reverse mapping of IPv6
    addresses.

    Acknowledgments to Dick Franks who has provided elegant solutions and
    cleaned a bit of code.

    Note that directly calling Question->new() without arguments will
    cause the qclass,qtype to be IN, A instead of ANY, ANY.

    Net::DNS::Resolver's search() method would always gracefully
    interpret a qname in the form of an IPv4 address. It would go out
    and do a PTR query in the reverse address tree. This behavior has
    also been applied to IPv6 addresses in their many shapes and
    forms.

    This change did two things, 1) root zone not implicitly added to
    search list when looking up short name, 2) default domain appended
    to short name if DEFNAMES and not DNSRCH.

Fix rt.cpan.org 18113

   Minor error due to unapplied part of patch fixed.

Feature Implemented SPF (typecode 99).

   The class completely inherits from Net::DNS::RR::TXT (the easiest
   RR to implement ever).

Feature added rrsort() function.
   Feature was requested by Eric Hall in rt.cpan.org 13392

   This was a little tricky as I think that the sort functions are in
   fact RR specific class attributes that should be accessed through
   class methods. This is difficult to implement. I do think I found a
   fairly clean manner. It does require a global variable in Net::DNS
   to store the functions and some trickery when the sorting functions
   are defined.

   See Net::DNS and Net::DNS::RR documentation for details.

   Defaults sorting functions are currently implemented in
      SRV: default sort: low priority to high priority and for
           same preference highest weight first.
	   weight: sort all RRs based on weight, highest first
	   priority: see default sort

      MX:  default sort: lowest preference first.
           preference: see default sort

    NAPTR: default sort: lowest to highest order, for same order lowest
           preference first

   TCP fallback after V6 socket failure

   Reworked Net::DNS::Base::Nameserver::send_tcp() to fallback to IPv4 when
   possible. (change applied to SVN Revision 538).

Feature Cleanup duplicated code

   axfr_send() and send_tcp() contained some duplicated code. I merged
   this in one "helper" method _create_tcp_socket()

Fix AXFR persistent sockets colliding with query sockets.

   I think that using the same persistent sockets for AXFR and
   'ordinary' queries could lead to race conditions. Better safe than
   sorry. For axfrs we create a different set of persistent sockets.

   Note that this prevents performing a SOA query first and then using
   the same socket for the zone transfer itself(in Net::DNS these are
   different code paths). This behavior of SOA and transfer on the
   same socket-- seems to be suggested by 1035 section 4.2.2:

     "In particular, the server should allow the SOA and AXFR request
     sequence (which begins a refresh operation) to be made on a
     single connection."

   Obviously, on the client side this behavior is not mandatory.

Fix rt.cpan.org 17596

    The fixes and features above also fixed the timeout problem reported by

Profiling

    It turned out that each time we were calling

  Using Net-DNS 0.53 on Win XP, it is unable to retrieve the
  nameservers when the IP address of the interface is assigned by

      limits its audience.  Since many daemon programs are already
      driven by a top level select loop, it seems useful to provide an
      API for the user to integrate Net::DNS::Nameserver processing to
      their own select loop.

   He also supplied example code for which he is hereby acknowledged.
   The patch was not used because simultaneously Robert Martin-LegÃ¨ne
   supplied a patch to Nameservers.pm that allowed the same async
   functionality through the use of loop_once method. Robert M-L's
   code also carefully manages the TCP sockets, so that they can
   deal with AXFRs.

   Robert S. has been so kind to review Robert M-L's code and is hereby
   kindly acknowledged.

   NB. Since the code may be subject to change the documentation of the
   loop_once method has been commented out.

    Fixed a problem with persistent TCP sockets which was introduced
    because of using the address family as an index to the array of
    persistent sockets.

    Used AF_UNSPEC for the array index for the TCP socket; just to choose
    a number. The key to the persistent sockets is the remote nameserver:port
    combination.

    The escaped characters test failed on some system because the

Fix rt.cpan.org 13239:

    When queries are refused the resolver would not take the next

    I was also made aware that the "use byte" pragma is incompatible
    with pre 5.06 perl.

    BEGIN {
          eval { require bytes; }
    }

    It should be noted that for perl versions < 5.006 I had to disable
    the escaped character test. Don't expect domain names with labels
    that contain anything else than host names to work for versions
    earlier than perl 5.6.0.

No changes with respect to 0.49_03.

*** 0.49_03  June 1, 2005  (Version 0.50 release candidate 3)

Fix:
      Concatenation of scalars caused modification of data because of
      Perl's habit to treat scalars as utf characters instead of bytes.
      Inserted use bytes pragma throughout the code base. DNS is done
      in octets.

Feature:
      Added "ignqrid" as an attribute to the Resolver.

      use as:
      ok (my $res=Net::DNS::Resolver->new(nameservers => ['127.0.0.1'],
				    port => 5354,
				    recurse => 0,
				    igntc => 1,
				    ignqrid => 1,
				    ),

      When the attribute is set to a non-zero value replies with the
      qr bit clear and replies with non-matching query ids are
      happily accepted. This opens the possibility to accept spoofed
      answers. YOU CAN BURN YOURSELF WITH THIS FEATURE.

      It is set to 0 per default and remains, except for this changes file
      an undocumented feature.

*** 0.49_02  May 28, 2005  (Version 0.50 release candidate 2)

Fix: Smoking Gun tests for non-cygwin Win32.
      Makefile.PL failed to produce a proper Makefile under win32.
      (e.g. www,nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/210570)
      I worked around that by moving the library into the base
      directory of the distribution as the "subdir" section
      seemed to be all funny.

Fix: rt.cpan.org#11931 (the off-topic part)

      Sidney Markowitz spotted an awkward condition that rarely happens but is
      significant enough to be dealt with.

      In the send_udp method there are two loops: one over the nameservers
      and one that waits for the sockets to come forward with data.

      That second loop will sometimes timeout and then be entered with a
      repeated query to the same nameserver. It occasionally happens that the
      old packet arrives on the socket. That packet is discarded but the
      loop does not return to the loop to wait for the remainder of the
      timeout period for an answer on the second query, that may still arrive.
      This has now been fixed.

      Thanks to Sidney for the assessment of the problem and the fix.

*** 0.49_01    (Version 0.50 release candidate 1)

Fix: Makefile.PL: Minor tweak to recognize Mac OS X 10.4 not so relevant
    since netdnslib is distributed with the code.

Feature: Calling the Net::DNS::Resolver::dnssec method with a non-zero
    argument will set the udppacketsize to 2048. The method will
    also carp a warning if you pass a non-zero argument when
    Net::DNS::SEC is not installed.

Feature: IPv6 transport support

     IPv6 transport has been added to the resolver and to the
     nameserver code.

     To use IPv6 please make sure that you have IO::Socket::INET6 version
     2.01 or later installed.

     If IPv6 transport is available Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse will make
     use of it (picking randomly between IPv4 and IPv6 transport) use
     the force_v4() method to only force IPv4.

Feature: Binary characters in labels

     RFC 1035 3.1:

       Domain names in messages are expressed in terms of a sequence of
       labels.  Each label is represented as a one octet length field
       followed by that number of octets.  Since every domain name ends
       with the null label of the root, a domain name is terminated by a
       length byte of zero.  The high order two bits of every length octet
       must be zero, and the remaining six bits of the length field limit
       the label to 63 octets or less.

     Unfortunately dname attributes are stored strings throughout
     Net::DNS.  (With hindsight dnames should have had their own class
     in which one could have preserved the wire format.).

     To be able to represent all octets that are allowed in domain
     names I took the approach to use the "presentation format" for
     the attributes. This presentation format is defined in RFC 1035
     5.1.

     I added code to parse presentation format domain names that has
     escaped data such as \ddd and \X (where X is not a number) to
     wireformat and vice verse. In the conversion from wire format to
     presentation format the characters that have special meaning in a
     zone file are escaped (so that they can be cut-n-pasted without
     pain).

     These are " (0x22), $ (0x24), (0x28), ) (0x29), . (0x2e) , ;
     (0x3b), @ (ox40) and \ (0x5c). The number between brackets
     representing the ascii code in hex.

     Note that wherever a name occurs as a string in Net::DNS it is
     now in presentation format.

     For those that dealt with 'hostnames' (subset of all possible
     domain names) this will be a completely transparent change.

     Details:

     I added netdnslib which contains Net::DNS's own dn_expand. Its
     implemented in C and the source is a hodgepodge of Berkeley based
     code and snippets from ISC's bind9 distribution. The behavior, in
     terms of which chars are escaped, is similar to bind9.

     There are some functions added to DNS.pm that do conversion from
     presentation and wire format and back. They should only be used
     internally (although they live in EXPORT_OK.)

     For esoteric test cases see t/11-escapedchars.t.

Fix: rt.cpan.org #11931

     Incorrect searchlist duplication removal in Net::DNS::Resolver::Win32
     Patch courtesy Risto Kankkunen.

Problem: rt.cpan.org #11931

     Win32.pm used the DNSRegisteredAdapters registry key to determine which
     local forwarders to send queries to. This is arguably the wrong key as it
     is used to identify the server which to send dynamic updates to.

     A real fix for determining the set of nameservers to query has not been

      No redundant lookups on SERVFAIL response
     and #6149
      Does not search multiple DNS servers

      Net::DNS::Resolver will now use the other nameservers in the
      list if the RCODE of the answer is not NOERROR (0) or NXDOMAIN
      (3). When send() exhausted the last nameserver from the it will
      return the answer that was received from the last nameserver
      that responded with an RCODE.

      The errorstring will be set to "RCODE: "

Fix: rt.cpan.org #8803
      TXT records don't work with semicolons

      Since we are expecting "zonefile" presentation at input
      a comment will need to be escaped ( \; ).

      It could be argued that this is a to strict interpretation of
      1035 section 5.1.

      While working on this I discovered there are more problems with
      TXT RRs. Eg; 0100 is a perfectly legal character string that
      should be represented as "\000" in a zonefile. Net::DNS does
      pass character strings with "non-ASCII" chars from the wire
      to the char_str_lst array but the print functions do not
      properly escape them when printing.

      Properly dealing with zonefile presentation format and binary
      data is still to be done.

	Net::DNS::Packet->data makes incorrect assumptions

      Implemented the "pop" method for the question.

Net::DNS is now stored in a subversion repository, replacing cvs.
As such the submodule version numbers have taken another big jump.
Luckily those numbers don't matter as long as they work.

Fixed a bug with Unknown RR types that broke zone signing [Olaf].

Added callback support to Net::DNS::Resolver::Recurse.  The
demo/trace_dns.pl script demonstrates this.

Added a note regarding answers with an empty answer section to the

No changes from 0.44_02.

** 0.44_02 January 3, 2004

The XS detection code was broken.  We actually use the XS bits now.

Major cleanups/optimizations of the various RR subclasses.  This release
of Net::DNS is over twice as fast at parsing dns packets as 0.44.

** NOTICE **

$rr->rdatastr no longer returns '; no data' if the RR record has no
data.  This happens in $rr->string now.

Net::DNS::Packet::safe_push() no longer exists.  The method is now only
available from Net::DNS::Update objects.

** 0.44_01 January 3, 2004

Net::DNS::RR objects were not playing nice with Storable, this caused
the axfr demo script to fail.  Thanks to Joe Dial for the report.

** NOTICE **
This may cause RR objects that are already serialize to not deserialize
correctly.

Reply handlers in Net::DNS::Nameserver are now passed the query object.

Fixed a nasty bug in Nameserver.pm related to the qr bit.  As Olaf
explained:

  Replies are sent if the query has its "qr" bit set. The "qr" bit is an
  indication that the packet is sent as a response to a query. Since
  there are more implementations that suffer from this bug one can cause
  all kinds of nasty ping-pong loops by spoofing the initial packet or
  have an infinite query loop by spoofing a query from the localhost:53
  address.

Various Win32/Cygwin cleanups from Sidney Markowitz.

*** 0.44 December 12, 2003

	The Wrath of CPAN Release.

CPAN.pm doesn't understand the nature of revision numbers.  1.10 is

All the internal version numbers in Net::DNS have been bumped to
2.100 in order to fix this.

No actual code changes in this release.

*** 0.43 December 11, 2003

Added warning of deprecation of Net::DNS::Packet::safe_push.  This will

of Net::DNS::Packet.

** 0.42_02 December 11, 2003

Fixed a long standing bug with zone transfers in the "many-answers" format.
CPAN #1903.

Added the '--online-tests' flag to Makefile.PL.  This activates the online
tests without asking the user interactively.  "--no-online-tests" turns
the tests off.

Cleaned up Makefile.PL a little.  The "--pm" flag is now deprecated, use
"--no-xs" instead.

Added support for unknown RR types (rfc3597). Note for developers: the
typesbyname, typesbyval, classesbyname and classesbyval hashes should
not be used directly, use the same named wrapper functions
instead. [Olaf Kolkman]

Added two hashes for administrative use; they store which types are
qtypes and metatypes (rfc2929). [Olaf Kolkman]

Added version to all the modules in the distribution.

** 0.39_01 August 12 2003

Added a META.yaml.  The crystal ball says an upgrade to Module::Install may
be coming soon.

Changed how the versions of the various submodules were set.  The CPAN
indexer cannot execute "$VERSION = $Net::DNS::VERSION".  The single line
with the $VERSION assignment is pulled out of the file and eval'ed; at
that time, Net::DNS is not loaded.  The submodules now pull their version
numbers out of CVS.

Fixed a bug on Win32 where some machines separated lists with commas,
not whitespace.  Thanks to Jim White for pointing it out.

** 0.38_02 July 29 2003

Reworked the POD for Net::DNS::Resolver.

When parsing resolver configuration files, IPv6 addresses are now skipped,
as Net::DNS does not yet have IPv6 support.

** 0.38_01 Jun 22 2003

Broke Net::DNS::Resolver into separate classes.  UNIX and Win32
classes are currently implemented.  Many of the globals in
Net::DNS::Resolver no longer exist.  They were never documented
so you never used them.... right?

Options to Net::DNS::Resolver->new() are now supported, including
using your own configuration file.  See the Net::DNS::Resolver man
page for details.

Tweaked Net::DNS::RR::TXT to fail more gracefully when the quotes
in the data section are not balanced.

Add more tests (of course).

Moved next_id() from Resolver.pm to Header.pm (which is where it is
used).

Net::DNS::Select now uses $^O directly, this means that the second
argument to Net::DNS::Select::new() (the OS) is now ignored.

*** 0.38 Jun 5 2003

Various buglets fixed in the new Makefile.PL.

Use Dynaloader instead of XSLoader.  Turns out that XSLoader is only
in more recent perls.

Added deprecation warning to Net::DNS::Resolver::axfr_old().

HP-UX fixes [cpan #2710], I don't have the name of the reporter/patcher.

*** 0.37 May 28 2003

Renamed the test C file to compile.c, test.c was confusing the 'make test'
target.

*** 0.36 May 28 2003

Removed Rob Brown's RPM stuff.  Something odd happened in the 0.35 tarball
and at the moment I don't have the time to investigate.

*** 0.35 May 26 2003

POD fixes, added tests for POD.

*** 0.34_03 May 22 2003

Reworked Makefile.PL to try and detect if you have a working C compiler.

Added '--pm' and '--xs' command line options to Makefile.PL

Fixed linking problem on linux.

Tie::DNSHash removed from the package, see Tie::DNS from CPAN for a more
complete implementation of a DNS hash.

*** 0.34_02 May 21 2003

Net::DNS::Packet::dn_expand is now implemented using the function of the
same name from libresolv.  This method of decompressing names is around
twice as fast as the perl implementation.

Applied Jan Dubois's patch to fix nameserver lookup on Windows 2000/95/98/ME.

Applied patch from Dan Sully (daniel@electricrain.com) allowing multiple
questions to be part of a DNS packet.

*** 0.33 8 Jan 2003

Fixed 00-load.t to skip the Net::DNS::SEC modules.  The test suite
should now pass if you have Net::DNS::SEC installed.

Fixed the regular expression in RR.pm to comply with the RFCs, turns
out we were _too_ paranoid.  [Olaf]

*** 0.32 5 Jan 2003

Various cleanups for perl 5.004.  Thanks to nathan@anderson-net.com

# USN-483-1: libnet-dns-perl vulnerabilities

13 July 2007

libnet-dns-perl vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Peter Johannes Holzer discovered that the Net::DNS Perl module had

predictable sequence numbers. This could allow remote attackers to

carry out DNS spoofing, leading to possible machine-in-the-middle attacks.

([CVE-2007-3377](/security/CVE-2007-3377))

Steffen Ullrich discovered that the Net::DNS Perl module did not correctly

detect recursive compressed responses. A remote attacker could send a

specially crafted packet, causing applications using Net::DNS to crash or

monopolize CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-3409](/security/CVE-2007-3409))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* libnet-dns-perl
  -
  0.57-1ubuntu1

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* libnet-dns-perl
  -
  0.53-2ubuntu1

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to

effect the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Net::DNS: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200708-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Net::DNS Perl module,
allowing for a Denial of Service and a cache poisoning attack.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-perl/Net-DNS** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.60** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.60** |

### Background

Net::DNS is a Perl implementation of a DNS resolver.

### Description

hjp discovered an error when handling DNS query IDs which make them
partially predictable. Steffen Ullrich discovered an error in the
dn\_expand() function which could lead to an endless loop.

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted DNS request to the
server which could result in a Denial of Service with an infinite
recursion, or perform a cache poisoning attack.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Net::DNS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-perl/Net-DNS-0.60"
```

Package        : libnet-dns-perl
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-3377 CVE-2007-3409 CVE-2007-6341
Debian Bug     : 457445

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in libnet-dns-perl.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

It was discovered that libnet-dns-perl generates very weak transaction
IDs when sending queries (CVE-2007-3377).  This update switches
transaction ID generation to the Perl random generator, making
prediction attacks more difficult.

Compression loops in domain names resulted in an infinite loop in the
domain name expander written in Perl (CVE-2007-3409).  The Debian
package uses an expander written in C by default, but this vulnerability
has been addressed nevertheless.

Decoding malformed A records could lead to a crash (via an uncaught
Perl exception) of certain applications using libnet-dns-perl
(CVE-2007-6341).

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.59-1etch1.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.48-1sarge1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libnet-dns-perl package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
