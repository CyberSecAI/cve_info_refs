- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the vulnerability lies within the `page.php` script where user-supplied input via the `id` parameter is not properly handled before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `page.php` script. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries. The vulnerability is present in Fa Name version 1.0.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Obtaining sensitive data from the database
    - Modification of database contents
    - Acquiring administrator privileges
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, targeting the `page.php` script via HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request with a malicious SQL payload through the `id` parameter to the `page.php` script. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, and the attack complexity is considered medium. The server must have PHP `magic_quotes_gpc` set to off (which is not the default), allowing the injection to be successful.
