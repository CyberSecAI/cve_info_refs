Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3509:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Symantec Backup Exec for Windows Servers.
- The vulnerability lies in how one of the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interfaces handles requests using the `ncacn_ip_tcp` protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow.
- Improper handling of RPC requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: A remote attacker can cause the affected service to crash.
- Potential arbitrary code execution:  Symantec reports the possibility of an attacker executing arbitrary code on the affected system, though this is mentioned as a potential impact, not a certainty.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker can connect to the affected service.
- Attacker sends a specially crafted packet to exploit the RPC interface vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to connect to the vulnerable service over the network.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft and send malicious packets.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable service listens on port 6106/tcp.
- The vulnerability is present in Symantec Backup Exec for Windows Servers.
- A patch from the vendor is available.
- Workarounds include blocking access to the vulnerable software from outside the network perimeter and using host-based firewalls.
