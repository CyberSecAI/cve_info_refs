Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to SQL injection in the `CategoryID` parameter of the `process.php` file within the Easybe 1-2-3 Music Store application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (specifically the `CategoryID` parameter) before using it in SQL queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. Specifically, the provided exploit demonstrates how to retrieve admin login credentials (`login` and `passwd`) from the `user` table via error messages.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with a specially crafted `CategoryID` parameter within a GET request to the vulnerable `process.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the server. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of application**: The attacker needs to know the specific parameters and files that are vulnerable, in this case, `process.php` and the `CategoryID` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit uses `UNION ALL SELECT` to inject a query that retrieves the desired information.
- The exploit also uses `concat` function to format the output in the error message with a red color font tag to make it easily visible within the error message.
- The content also mentions that the admin login page can be found at `/process.php?pname=ShowPageProcess-Start&page=admin/index`.
