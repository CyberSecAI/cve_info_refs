      "cve_id": "CVE-2007-3633",
      "description": "The Chilkat Zip ActiveX component (ChilkatZip2.dll v. 12.4.2.0) contains multiple insecure methods. The `SaveLastError()` method allows overwriting arbitrary files. The `WriteExe()` method is also vulnerable but no specific details on this vulnerability were provided in this source.",
      "root_cause": "The `SaveLastError()` method in the ActiveX control allows writing to arbitrary file paths specified by the user. There is no proper validation or sanitization of user supplied input, leading to arbitrary file overwrite.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure method `SaveLastError()` allows arbitrary file overwrite",
         "Likely insecure method `WriteExe()`"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary file overwrite. In the provided exploit, the `system.ini` file is overwritten, which can prevent the system from restarting.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attack via a webpage embedding the vulnerable ActiveX control."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to embed the ActiveX control in a website and convince a user to visit the malicious page. No user interaction beyond page viewing is necessary to trigger the vulnerability."
