Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the "Word 6-2000 Filter.xnt" DLL, a text-import extension of QuarkXPress 7.2. This DLL is used to import text from MSWord DOC files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of `lstrcpy()` to copy font names read from a DOC file into a fixed-size 256-byte stack buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- Alternatively, the vulnerability can be exploited to crash the QuarkXPress application.
- Confirmed code execution on English WinXP SP2.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user imports text from a maliciously crafted MSWord DOC file into QuarkXPress using the "Rectangle Text Box" tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious DOC file containing an overly long font name.
- The attacker must convince the victim to import text from this malicious DOC file within QuarkXPress.
