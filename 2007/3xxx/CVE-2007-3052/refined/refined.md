      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_7b327f93_20250124_172339.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the 'index.php' file when handling the 'c' parameter.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries to extract sensitive information from the database. In this specific exploit, the attacker is able to retrieve the admin username and password.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the 'index.php' file with a specially crafted 'c' parameter containing malicious SQL code.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. They also need to know the path to the vulnerable PNphpBB2 application and have some idea about the database prefix in order to craft the SQL injection string. The exploit provides an option to specify a user ID which may be needed to retrieve the administrator information."
