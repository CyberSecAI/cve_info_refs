How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SQL Injection Vulnerability in Oracle APEX CHECK\_DB\_PASSWORD
#######################################################
This advisory
<http://www.red-database-security.com/advisory/oracle\_apex\_sql\_injection
\_check\_db\_password.html>
Name SQL Injection Vulnerability in Oracle CHECK\_DB\_PASSWORD
Systems Oracle APEX
Severity Medium Risk
Category SQL Injection
Author Alexander Kornbrust (ak at red-database-security.com)
Date 17 July 2007 (V 1.00)
Details
########
The function wwv\_flow\_security.check\_db\_password contains a SQL injection vulnerability.
Oracle is using the ALTER USER command to change the password of a database user without
doing an input validation of the password (=typical Oracle PL/SQL programming fault).
APEX 3.0.1 is now doing an input validation on the user password. Apex 3.0.1 is used in
Oracle 11g.
Old, vulnerable code
####################
FUNCTION CHECK\_DB\_PASSWORD (P\_USER\_NAME VARCHAR2, P\_PASSWORD VARCHAR2) RETURN BOOLEAN IS
BEGIN
IF P\_USER\_NAME IS NULL OR P\_PASSWORD IS NULL THEN
RETURN FALSE;END IF;
BEGIN
EXCEPTION
WHEN NO\_DATA\_FOUND THEN RETURN FALSE;END;
BEGIN
EXCEPTION
WHEN NO\_DATA\_FOUND THEN RETURN FALSE;END;
L\_STMT:= 'ALTER USER "' || P\_USER\_NAME || '" IDENTIFIED BY "' || P\_PASSWORD||'"';
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE L\_STMT;
New code
########
Oracle is now doing a length check of the password (30 characters). Good idea. I'm
interested to see if this is changed in 11g where passwords up to 50 characters are
allowed. One part of the input validation is stupid code. If the password contains a
chr(34) Oracle throws an error message.
chr(34) is never executed. Even if this code would be executed this could be bypassed
quite easily (e.g. chr( 34) or chr(34 ) or chr(35-1) or ...)
FUNCTION CHECK\_DB\_PASSWORD (P\_USER\_NAME VARCHAR2, P\_PASSWORD VARCHAR2) RETURN BOOLEAN IS
BEGIN
IF P\_USER\_NAME IS NULL OR P\_PASSWORD IS NULL THEN
RETURN FALSE;END IF;
IF LENGTH(P\_PASSWORD) > 30 OR INSTR(P\_PASSWORD,'"') > 0 OR INSTR(LOWER(P\_PASSWORD),'chr(34)') > 0 THEN RETURN FALSE;END IF;
BEGIN
EXCEPTION
WHEN NO\_DATA\_FOUND THEN RETURN FALSE;END;
BEGIN
EXCEPTION
WHEN NO\_DATA\_FOUND THEN RETURN FALSE;END;
L\_STMT:= 'ALTER USER "' || P\_USER\_NAME || '" IDENTIFIED BY "' || P\_PASSWORD||'"';
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE L\_STMT;
Affected Products
#################
This bug is fixed with 3.0.1 of APEX which is not part of the Critical Patch Update July 2006. It's necessary to upgrade your APE installation to 3.0.1 or higher. Apex 3.0.1 is compatible with Oracle Application Express.
Patch Information

This bug is fixed with Apex 3.0.1 or higher.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Oracle is using the ALTER USER command to change the password of a database user. Oracle forgot to do an input validation of the password (=typical programming fault). APEX 3.0.1 is doing an input validation on the user password.  Old, vulnerable code FUNCTION CHECK\_DB\_PASSWORD (P\_USER\_NAME VARCHAR2, P\_PASSWORD VARCHAR2) RETURN BOOLEAN IS BEGIN IF P\_USER\_NAME IS NULL OR P\_PASSWORD IS NULL THEN RETURN FALSE;END IF; BEGIN EXCEPTION WHEN NO\_DATA\_FOUND THEN RETURN FALSE;END; BEGIN EXCEPTION WHEN NO\_DATA\_FOUND THEN RETURN FALSE;END; L\_STMT:= 'ALTER USER "' || P\_USER\_NAME || '" IDENTIFIED BY "' || P\_PASSWORD||'"'; EXECUTE IMMEDIATE L\_STMT;   New code  Oracle is now doing a length check of the password (30 characters). Good idea. I'm interested to see if this is changed in 11g where passwords up to 50 characters are allowed. One part of the input validation is stupid code. If the password contains a chr(34) Oracle throws an error message. chr(34) is never executed. Even if this code would be executed this could be bypassed quite easily (e.g. chr( 34) or chr(34 ) or chr(35-1) or ...)   FUNCTION CHECK\_DB\_PASSWORD (P\_USER\_NAME VARCHAR2, P\_PASSWORD VARCHAR2) RETURN BOOLEAN IS BEGIN IF P\_USER\_NAME IS NULL OR P\_PASSWORD IS NULL THEN RETURN FALSE;END IF; IF LENGTH(P\_PASSWORD) > 30 OR INSTR(P\_PASSWORD,'"') > 0 OR INSTR(LOWER(P\_PASSWORD),'chr(34)') > 0 THEN RETURN FALSE;END IF;  BEGIN EXCEPTION WHEN NO\_DATA\_FOUND THEN RETURN FALSE;END; BEGIN EXCEPTION WHEN NO\_DATA\_FOUND THEN RETURN FALSE;END; L\_STMT:= 'ALTER USER "' || P\_USER\_NAME || '" IDENTIFIED BY "' || P\_PASSWORD||'"'; EXECUTE IMMEDIATE L\_STMT;    Affected Products This bug is fixed with 3.0.1 of APEX which is not part of the Critical Patch Update July 2006. It's necessary to upgrade your APE installation to 3.0.1 or higher. Apex 3.0.1 is compatible with Oracle Application Express.  Patch Information This bug is fixed with Apex 3.0.1 or higher.
