Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-3860:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `wwv_flow_security.check_db_password` function within Oracle Application Express (APEX). Specifically, the function uses the `ALTER USER` command to change a database user's password without properly sanitizing the provided password input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. Because the password input is not sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the password parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Database User Password Modification:** An attacker could use the SQL injection vulnerability to modify the password of a database user.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation or Data Access:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to the database, allowing attackers to potentially escalate privileges, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.
- The impact is rated as "Partial" for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack is launched remotely, meaning an attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable APEX application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the application

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code uses `ALTER USER` command with user-supplied password without sanitization:
```sql
L_STMT := 'ALTER USER "' || P_USER_NAME || '" IDENTIFIED BY "' || P_PASSWORD || '"';
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE L_STMT;
```
- The advisory mentions a flawed attempt to mitigate the vulnerability by filtering for `chr(34)` (double quote) which is easily bypassed. The fix included a length check of the password(30 char)

**Affected Products:**
- Oracle Application Express (formerly Oracle HTML DB) versions 2.2.0.00.32 up to 3.0.0.00.20.

**Patch Information:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in APEX 3.0.1 and later.  It is necessary to upgrade to this version or higher. This fix is not part of the Critical Patch Update July 2006 but was included in the Critical Patch Update July 2007.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory also mentions the issue was reported to Oracle Security Alert on 07-May-2007, confirmed on the same date and a fix was released with APEX 3.0.1 on 29-Jun-2007

The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" risk but has a CVSS base score of 7.5/10 due to the ease of remote exploitation (Exploitability subscore 10/10)
