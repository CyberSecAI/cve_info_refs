Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-3898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Microsoft Windows DNS Server uses a predictable algorithm for generating transaction IDs when sending queries to upstream DNS servers. It uses a set of 8 independent counters that are incremented pseudo-randomly. Each transaction ID is taken from a randomly chosen counter. Due to this predictable pattern an attacker can predict the transaction ID of the request that the caching server sends

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable Transaction IDs:** The core vulnerability lies in the predictable nature of the DNS transaction IDs generated by the Windows DNS server. Transaction IDs are meant to be unique identifiers used to match DNS queries with their respective responses. When these IDs are predictable, an attacker can forge responses that the DNS server will accept.
- **Fixed Source Port:** The Windows DNS server uses a fixed source port for queries, making it easier for attackers to spoof replies.
- **Recursive Queries:** The vulnerability affects DNS servers that perform recursive lookups (i.e., those that query other DNS servers on behalf of clients).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **DNS Cache Poisoning:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to poison the DNS cache of a Windows DNS server.
- **Redirection to Malicious Domains:** By injecting false DNS records, an attacker can redirect users to malicious websites instead of the legitimate ones they intended to visit. This can lead to phishing attacks, malware distribution, and other forms of malicious activity.
- **Spoofing**: An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could impersonate a legitimate address.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Attack:** The attack can be launched remotely by an unauthenticated attacker.
- **Spoofed DNS Replies:** The attacker sends spoofed DNS responses with a predicted transaction ID and a manipulated DNS record.
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker can create a web page containing resources (e.g. images) from attacker-controlled domain which will cause the victim browser's DNS server to send queries to the attacker's DNS server. This enables the attacker to observe and predict the transaction IDs. This is used to craft spoofed replies and inject them into the target's DNS cache.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control of Authoritative DNS Server:** The attacker needs to control a DNS server authoritative for some domain.
- **Ability to Send Recursive Queries:** The attacker must be able to send recursive queries to the target DNS server.
- **Predict Transaction IDs**: The attacker needs to be able to predict transaction IDs of queries from the target DNS server to send spoofed replies.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-062.
- The issue is present in Microsoft Windows 2000 Server SP4 and Windows Server 2003 SP1 and SP2.
- This vulnerability was reported by Alla Berzroutchko of Scanit and Amit Klein of Trusteer.
- This vulnerability is not present in Windows 2000 Professional Service Pack 4, Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2, Windows Vista, Windows Vista x64
