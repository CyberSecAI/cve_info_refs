How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Microsoft Windows DNS Server vulnerable to cache poisoning

#### Vulnerability Note VU#484649

Original Release Date: 2007-11-13 | Last Revised: 2007-11-13

---

### Overview

The Microsoft Windows DNS Server is vulnerable to cache poisoning, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a Windows DNS server to provide incorrect responses to DNS queries.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows DNS Server is a service that provides DNS serving capabilities for Windows 2000 server and Windows Server 2003. For a DNS server to trust a reply to a DNS request, the reply must contain the correct client source port and address as well as an identifier known as the transaction ID. Windows DNS server uses a predictable transaction ID generator, which can allow DNS cache poisoning. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to poison the cache of a Windows DNS server. This can cause client machines that use the DNS server to be redirected to malicious domains as the result of an incorrect DNS response. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**  This issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS07-062](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS07-062.mspx). |

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Display a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

IBM Trusteer analyzes devices on several levels. Device attributes are reviewed and checked for spoofing and abnormalities. Devices are then checked for malware before being scanned for other cybercriminal tools
such as emulators, screen overlays and remote access tools.

Network information is crucial in determining the risk associated with a potential fraudulent activity. Trusteer checks for the location, carrier or hosting service while also detecting whether a VPN is being used or a call is in progress on the device because these are common social engineering techniques.

Behavior of a user can be assessed by looking at behavioral biometrics such as swipes, keystrokes, mouse movements, session length and more. These can be compared to previous user sessions and flagged if discrepancies are detected.

Data relating to the user’s accounts can be key in determining whether a cybercriminal is performing fraudulent activities. Transactional data such as amounts, targeted accounts and transactional types alongside account opening data can be analyzed and used to prevent funneling of funds to criminals.

IBM Trusteer employs a team of world-class threat experts that constantly monitor the dark web to identify emerging threats and devise ways to detect them. In addition, they tap into a global intelligence network of millions of devices across 190 countries by using a unique and persistent fingerprint for every device.

Predictable DNS transaction IDs in Microsoft DNS Server
Author
Alla Bezroutchko
Summary
Affected software: Microsoft Windows 2003 SP2, Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 Server
Vendor URL: www.microsoft.com
Severity: Medium
References: Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-062, CVE-2007-3898
Vulnerability Description
Microsoft DNS server generates predictable DNS transaction IDs. If the server is configured to allow recursive queries it is possible to insert fake records in the DNS cache (DNS cache poisoning) by guessing the next transaction ID that the server will use and sending a spoofed DNS reply to the server. To observe the transaction IDs an attacker needs to control a DNS server that is authoritative for some domain and to be able to send a recursive queries to the caching Microsoft DNS server.
When an attacker sends a recursive query to a caching name server, the caching server will find a server authoritative for the zone and send a request to the authoritative name server. If an attacker can predict the transaction ID of the request that the caching server sends, he can generate spoofed replies. The caching server will accept spoofed reply as coming from authoritative name server and cache the fake data.
The attack scenario is as follows. The attacker controls authoritative name server for some zone, in our example cache-poisoning.net. The victim has a recursive DNS server that the attacker can query (ns.victim.com). Victim's server runs Microsft DNS server. Attacker wants victim's DNS cache to think that www.hotmail.com has IP address 127.0.0.1 (or any other).
First the attacker gathers a sample of DNS transaction IDs that ns.victim.com uses for outgoing queries. He makes a number of recursive queries to ns.victim.com for hosts in cache-poisoning.net zone. Ns.victim.com will query the name server for cache-poisoning.net. The attacker records the transaction IDs of the requests sent to the name server of cache-poisoning.net by ns.victim.com.
Microsoft DNS transaction IDs follow a certain pattern. There seems to be 8 independent counters that are randomly incremented. Each transaction ID is taken from a randomly chosen counter. So, there are 8 sequences of randomly incrementing numbers. A sample of transaction IDs below illustrates that:
15222 - sequence 1
13177 - sequence 2
2944 - sequence 3
13197 - sequence 2, 13197 > 13177 increment=20
9108 - sequence 4
13208 - sequence 2, 13208 > 13197 increment=11
15268 - sequence 5
9131 - sequence 4, 9131 > 9108 increment=23
7094 - sequence 6
15291 - sequence 5, increment = 23
960 - sequence 7
15309 - sequence 5, increment = 18
980 - sequence 7, increment = 20
3032 - sequence 8
992 - sequence 7, increment = 12
...
Having gathered a small sample of transaction IDs (50 to 100 is enough) used by the cache, the attacker can record the state of each of the 8 counters on the victim server.
The attacker will then query the victim server for the record he is trying to spoof, for example www.hotmail.com. The victim cache will send a query to the authoritative name server for hotmail.com. At the same time the attacker will send a number of spoofed DNS replies. The replies will have spoofed source address (appearing to come from the nameserver for hotmail.com), fake data (saying that www.hotmail.com is 127.0.0.1) and DNS transaction IDs starting from the recorded values of counters up to counter+500 (or more). In our testing, the attacker has a very good chance of hitting the right transaction ID. If the reply with the right transaction ID spoofed by the attacker will arrive before the reply from the real server, the victim cache will believe the spoofed reply and cache it.
The attack is made easier because Microsoft DNS server uses fixed source port for the queries (so the attacker doesn't need to guess the source port) and usually queries the first nameserver for the domain (so the attacker only has to spoof the replies from one IP address).
In our testing we were able to reliably inject spoofed replies into the cache.
The success of the attack depends on how busy a DNS cache is. If it is performing a lot of queries (using up transaction IDs) the attacker will only see a small fraction of IDs. It will be more difficult for the attacker to figure out the state of the counters and to predict the value of the transaction IDs.
It is commonly believed that if a caching DNS server is behind a firewall and it is not possible to query it from the outside, it would not be possible to perform a cache poisoning attack like the one discussed above. Unfortunately, this is not the case. An attacker can create a web page and entice someone inside the firewall to surf to this page. The page will contain images located at hosts in attacker-controlled domain. For example:
<img src="http://h1.cache-poisoning.net/image.gif">
<img src="http://h2.cache-poisoning.net/image.gif">
...
<img src="http://h100.cache-poisoning.net/image.gif">
When the victim browser's renders the page, it will make DNS queries to the DNS cache. The DNS cache will make queries to the name server for cache-poisoning.net, which is controlled by the attacker. The attacker can observe the transaction IDs used for the queries and predict the next transaction IDs. Adding an image pointing to hotmail.com will make the victim cache query for hotmail.com. The attacker can send a spoofed reply using the guessed value for the transaction ID. This attack only works if the caching Microsoft DNS server does not use a forwarder. If a forwarder is used the attacker will observe the transaction IDs generated by the forwarder.
To demonstrate this kind of attack and to make testing DNS server transaction IDs easier we created a web-based DNS TX ID analyzer. That web page makes your browser send queries to your DNS server for hosts in cache-poisoning.net domain. Your DNS server will send the queries to our DNS server which is authoritative for cache-poisoning.net domain. Our DNS servers records the transaction IDs that it received and they get displayed back to you by the web page. The page also analyzes the transaction IDs to check if they follow the MS DNS pattern discussed above.
Amit Klein's excellent paper discusses the web-based scenario in more detail and also provides the algorithm for predicting the DNS transaction IDs for Microsoft DNS more precisely with only 8 spoofed packets.
Verification
Gather a sample of about a hundred DNS transaction IDs generated by an MS DNS server. Feed them to this script: analyze\_ids.pl. If you get an output looking like this:
12168 : 0
3984 : 1
6044 : 2
12192 : 0
6056 : 2
16308 : 3
16316 : 3
6080 : 2
...
your server generates predictable transaction IDs. If you get output like this:
45087 : 0
65108 : 1
30613 : 2
60689 : 3
58308 : 4
38744 : 5
21461 : 6
51872 : 7
Id out of sequence: 55029
Id out of sequence: 61733
Id out of sequence: 34790
Id out of sequence: 13829
Id out of sequence: 24207
Id out of sequence: 8518
...
with a lot of lines saying "Id out of sequence", then your server's transaction IDs do not follow MS DNS pattern.
If you get some of the lines saying "Id out of sequence" but not most of them, then your server is probably vulnerable, but is under some load. Try gathering transaction IDs when the server is not handling any other requests.
Alternatively, use use the web-based test to check the transaction IDs of the DNS server your computer is configured to use:
We have also provided a proof of concept script (spoofer-ms.pl) demonstrating DNS cache poisoning. The script has to be run on a server that is authoritative for some zone. The script listens on port 53 UDP, so it will require root privileges to run.
Historical Notes
Predictable DNS transaction IDs are a common and rather well researched problem.
It was first noticed that BIND 4.9.6 and below use sequential transaction IDs (http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1997-22.html). Microsoft fixed sequential DNS transaction IDs in a post-SP3 hotfix for Windows NT 4.0 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/167629/EN-US/).
After that a birthday attack against BIND was published by Vagner Sacramento (http://www.rnp.br/cais/alertas/2002/cais-ALR-19112002a.html) again allowing efficient prediction of DNS transaction IDs and cache poisoning. In 2003 Joe Steward published an attack methodology using phase space analysis (http://www.lurhq.com/dnscache.pdf). It allowed predicting the next transaction ID of BIND 8 using the 3 previous values. For BIND 9 about 5000 spoofed packets required to achieve 20% probability of success.
Our approach to predicting MS DNS transaction IDs is different from the birthday attack (we don't need send multiple requests for the host we want to spoof) and different from phase space analysis.
Solution
Microsoft has released a patch to correct this problem: Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-062
Time Table
2006/10/24 Vendor was informed
2006/10/26 Vendor confirmed the problem
2007/11/13 Patch is made available by Microsoft
2007/11/14 Scanit publishes the advisory

IBM Trusteer analyzes devices on several levels. Device attributes are reviewed and checked for spoofing and abnormalities. Devices are then checked for malware before being scanned for other cybercriminal tools
such as emulators, screen overlays and remote access tools.

Network information is crucial in determining the risk associated with a potential fraudulent activity. Trusteer checks for the location, carrier or hosting service while also detecting whether a VPN is being used or a call is in progress on the device because these are common social engineering techniques.

Behavior of a user can be assessed by looking at behavioral biometrics such as swipes, keystrokes, mouse movements, session length and more. These can be compared to previous user sessions and flagged if discrepancies are detected.

Data relating to the user’s accounts can be key in determining whether a cybercriminal is performing fraudulent activities. Transactional data such as amounts, targeted accounts and transactional types alongside account opening data can be analyzed and used to prevent funneling of funds to criminals.

IBM Trusteer employs a team of world-class threat experts that constantly monitor the dark web to identify emerging threats and devise ways to detect them. In addition, they tap into a global intelligence network of millions of devices across 190 countries by using a unique and persistent fingerprint for every device.
