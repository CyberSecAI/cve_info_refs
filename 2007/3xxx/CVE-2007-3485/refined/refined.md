{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'query' and 'within' parameters of the search functionality, which is powered by Yandex.Server. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, and phishing. The ability to inject arbitrary HTML also allows for manipulating the page content. The vulnerability allows for redirection to malicious websites, or displaying of other types of malicious content.",
      "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the query or within parameters and tricking a victim into clicking the link.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to generate a URL with the malicious code and trick the user into visiting this URL."
