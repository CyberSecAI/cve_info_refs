| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

This isn't quite limited to a dos. It has potential for data leakage, since any website can link to resource: scripts and stylesheets and then try to glean data from the result. For example, if you happen to have any interesting data stored in JSON on your hard drive, you lose.
I agree that it's not stop-ship, but I think it should be a very high priority for fixing as soon as we possibly can....

coalesce escaped slashes too
Well, this will work but will almost certainly cause multiple allocations for URIs over 40 chars... can you at least SetCapacity on spec before entering the loop?
Also, this needs a unit-test... you should be able to add a trivial one to <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/test/unit/test_bug337744.js> or write a new test copying that code.

\*(src+1) mighht not be valid. You need to check that src+1 != end.
Similar on the next line
(an nsACString isn't necessarily nullterminated)
I also don't think that appending character-by-character is particularly efficient code... but that probably doesn't matter much. (other code keeps track of how many characters were left unchanged and append them in once call. cf. <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/xpcom/io/nsEscape.cpp#516>)
I'd suggest spaces around your + operators but this file doesn't really seem to do that
r+sr=biesi if you fix the src+1 thing

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |

Networking
▾

Core :: Networking
For bugs in Mozilla's modular networking library (aka "Netlib" or "Necko".) The networking library supplies the software interface that Mozilla uses to access physical transports (e.g. the Internet and local drives), perform URL resolutions, and handle a variety of networking protocols.

Examples of appropriate bugs: URLs with backslash not fetched; URLs starting with a single slash turn into http:///; Cannot access authenticated FTP site.

Darin, biesi: this behavior is/was being prevented in the forward-slash case by net\_CoalesceDirs (<http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/netwerk/base/src/nsURLHelper.cpp#208>). Perhaps we can just fail if there are any backslashes at all in the resource URL?Assignee: nobody → benjamin

Given this has been discussed in public I'm opening this bug <http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20070516/read-firefox-settings-poc/#comment-35888> Group: security

Unless I'm missing something, the patches above only addresses this problem on Windows. There's a very similar bug on Mac OS X (and, I'd assume, any \*nix) with escaped forward slashes -- URLs of the form "resource:///..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2FUsers" can traverse the entire directory structure.
I can successfully and consistently exploit this on Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3 -- it's pretty straightforward, but please email me if you'd like PoC code.
My apologies if the OS X bug has already been patched elsewhere, or if it is not related to this bug. I searched bugzilla, but didn't turn up any other bugs that seem relevant.

I vote to reopen this bug.
I can reproduce Sam's findings as well. This affects more than just Windows XP and the provided patch does not address the vulnerability on OS X and Linux.

Does [bug 380994](/show_bug.cgi?id=380994 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fix for bug 367428 lets through escaped slashes on Linux (windows too on trunk)") address the vulnerability in 1.5.0.9 as well? I don't have access to verify.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
