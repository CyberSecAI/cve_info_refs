The provided content relates to CVE-2007-3000.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The PHP JackKnife (PHPJK) application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities including SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and full path disclosure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Unsanitized user inputs in `G_Display.php` and `Search/DisplayResults.php` allow attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Several parameters in `G_Display.php` and other scripts are vulnerable to XSS, allowing injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The application exposes the full server path when certain parameters are provided with an array as value (`[]`), revealing sensitive server information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Attackers can bypass authentication, read sensitive data from the database, including user credentials and configuration details. They can also potentially modify or delete data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** Attackers can gain insight into the server's directory structure, which could aid in further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Sending crafted HTTP GET requests with malicious SQL queries in the `iCategoryUnq` and `iSearchID` parameters.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Sending crafted HTTP GET requests with malicious JavaScript code in parameters like `iCategoryUnq`, `iDBLoc`, `iTtlNumItems`, `iNumPerPage`, `sSort`, `sUName` and `sAccountUnq`.
*  **Full Path Disclosure**: Sending crafted HTTP GET requests with array values in parameters such as `iCategoryUnq`, `sSort`, and `iParentUnq`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
