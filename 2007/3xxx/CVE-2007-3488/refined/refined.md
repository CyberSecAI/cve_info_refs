      "details": "This document describes CWE-119 (Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer), explaining the causes, consequences, and mitigation techniques for buffer overflows. It includes examples of vulnerable code and also references other related CVEs. The document emphasizes that buffer overflows occur due to writing data beyond the allocated buffer size, which leads to corruption, crashes, or remote code execution. It notes that the impact can range from denial of service to complete system compromise. The vulnerability is typically exploited by sending overly long inputs to a program, which then attempts to write this data into a fixed-size buffer, causing memory corruption."

      "details": "This entry from Exploit Database describes a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the ActiveX viewer of the Sony Network Camera SNC-P5 version 1.0. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) uses VBScript to send a string of 15000 'A' characters to the 'PrmSetNetworkParam' method of the ActiveX control. This action triggers a heap overflow, leading to a denial of service." ,
       "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient bounds check when handling network parameters within the ActiveX viewer control.",
       "weaknesses": [
          "Heap-based buffer overflow"
        ],
        "impact": "Denial of service.",

            "Sending an oversized string to a specific function of the vulnerable ActiveX control, which is accessible through the network."

      "details": "This entry describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in the ActiveX control of Sony SNC series network cameras. It notes that the vulnerability exists because the ActiveX control does not properly validate the size of input parameters, leading to a heap overflow when handling configuration settings. The affected products include multiple models of Sony SNC series network cameras. This document assigns a CVSS v2 base score of 6.8 to the vulnerability, indicating medium severity, with potential for partial impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability." ,
      "rootCause": "Insufficient input validation in the ActiveX control for Sony SNC series network cameras.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Heap-based buffer overflow"
        ],
        "impact": "Remote code execution is possible due to the heap overflow vulnerability which can lead to a compromise of the system or denial of service.",

            "Network-based attacks using malicious web pages or network tools that can trigger the vulnerable ActiveX control with crafted parameters"

       "details": "This document from JVN (Japan Vulnerability Notes) details a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the ActiveX control of Sony SNC series network cameras. It identifies numerous affected models, stating that the improper handling of configuration variables leads to the vulnerability. The impact is described as the possibility of arbitrary code execution by a remote attacker, and the suggested solution is updating the software. It also includes an analysis summary with details of complexity, user interaction and access requirements." ,
        "rootCause": "Improper processing of configuration variables in the ActiveX control.",
