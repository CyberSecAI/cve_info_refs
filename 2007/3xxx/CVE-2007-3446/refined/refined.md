    "Default Credentials: The application has a default login with username 'demo' and password 'demo'."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially perform the following actions:\n  - Gain unauthorized access to the database by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords.\n  - Inject malicious scripts through XSS, leading to potentially malicious actions on client-side, like phishing, session hijacking, or defacing the website.\n  - Gain unauthorized access to the application using default credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "SQL Injection: Manipulating the search box with crafted SQL queries.",
    "Cross-Site Scripting: Injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code through the 'msgs' parameter in the URL.",
    "Default Credentials: Logging into the admin panel using 'demo' as both the username and the password."
