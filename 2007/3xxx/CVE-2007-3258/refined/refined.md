Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from program flaws in the Calendarix scripts. Specifically, the scripts do not properly handle invalid date values, leading to PHP warnings or fatal errors. When these errors occur, the full server-side path to the script is disclosed within the error message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the server's file path through PHP error messages.
*   **Error Handling:** The scripts' insufficient error handling for invalid date parameters (year, month) triggers warnings that reveal the full path to the script.
*   **Dependence on OS:** The vulnerability is specific to PHP versions older than 5.0.0 running on MS Windows. It exploits how the `mktime()` and `date()` functions handle out-of-range date inputs on Windows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Attackers can gain partial confidentiality by learning the exact path to the Calendarix installation, which might help them plan other attacks.
*   **No Integrity or Availability Impact:** The vulnerability does not directly allow for modification of data or disruption of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **Specific HTTP GET Request Parameters:** The attack vector consists of sending specific GET requests to `calendar.php` with invalid values for the `year` or `month` parameters (e.g., `year=10000` or `month=10000`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server running Calendarix.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of target:** Knowledge of a target running the affected version of the application.
*   **Target Operating System:** The target needs to be running MS Windows.
*   **PHP version:** The target needs to be running PHP < 5.0.0

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to PHP versions prior to 5.0.0 running on MS Windows.
*   The `mktime()` and `date()` functions are the core of the issue due to how they handle the year and month values on Windows.
*   The vendor did not provide an official patch or show interest in coordinating the release.
*   The suggested workaround is to disable PHP error messages by setting `display_errors = Off` in the `php.ini` file.
