How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# ClamAV: Multiple Denials of Service — GLSA **200706-05**

ClamAV contains several vulnerabilities leading to a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-antivirus/clamav** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.90.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.90.3** |

### Background

ClamAV is a GPL virus scanner.

### Description

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in ClamAV by various
researchers:

* Victor Stinner (INL) discovered that the OLE2
  parser may enter in an infinite loop (CVE-2007-2650).
* A
  boundary error was also reported by an anonymous researcher in the file
  unsp.c, which might lead to a buffer overflow (CVE-2007-3023).
* The file unrar.c contains a heap-based buffer overflow via a
  modified vm\_codesize value from a RAR file (CVE-2007-3123).
* The RAR parsing engine can be bypassed via a RAR file with a header
  flag value of 10 (CVE-2007-3122).
* The cli\_gentempstream()
  function from clamdscan creates temporary files with insecure
  permissions (CVE-2007-3024).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted file to the scanner,
possibly triggering one of the vulnerabilities. The two buffer
overflows are reported to only cause Denial of Service. This would lead
to a Denial of Service by CPU consumption or a crash of the scanner.
The insecure temporary file creation vulnerability could be used by a
local user to access sensitive data.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.90.3"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-2650 CVE-2007-3023 CVE-2007-3024 CVE-2007-3122 CVE-2007-3123

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Clam anti-virus
toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2007-2650

    It was discovered that the OLE2 parser can be tricked into an infinite
    loop and memory exhaustion.

CVE-2007-3023

    It was discovered that the NsPack decompression code performed
    insufficient sanitising on an internal length variable, resulting in
    a potential buffer overflow.

CVE-2007-3024

    It was discovered that temporary files were created with insecure
    permissions, resulting in information disclosure.

CVE-2007-3122

    It was discovered that the decompression code for RAR archives allows
    bypassing a scan of a RAR archive due to insufficient validity checks.

CVE-2007-3123

    It was discovered that the decompression code for RAR archives performs
    insufficient validation of header values, resulting in a buffer overflow.

For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.17. Please note that the fix for CVE-2007-3024 hasn't
been backported to oldstable.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 0.90.1-3etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.90.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages. An updated package
for oldstable/powerpc is not yet available. It will be provided later.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
