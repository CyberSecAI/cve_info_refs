    "ID": "CVE-2007-3451",
    "content": "The provided content includes information about a SQL injection vulnerability in 6ALBlog, specifically related to the 'newsid' parameter, which is associated with CVE-2007-3451. \n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'newsid' parameter within the member.php file.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Additionally a remote file include vulnerability exists via the 'pg' parameter in admin/index.php\n\nImpact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete system compromise. The remote file inclusion vulnerability could allow execution of arbitrary code on the server.\n\nAttack vectors: The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted URL with a malicious SQL query embedded in the 'newsid' parameter of member.php. The remote file inclusion vulnerability is exploited by making a request to admin/index.php with the 'pg' parameter set to a remote file location.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application. No specific user privileges are required to exploit the SQL Injection, while the RFI requires administrative access."
