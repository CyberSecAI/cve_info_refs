The content discusses multiple potential XSS vulnerabilities in PHPIDS (PHP Intrusion Detection System) filters, along with methods to bypass these filters.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities discussed:

**1. IE Script Tag Variations:**

*   **Root Cause:** Internet Explorer translates specific variations of script tags (e.g., `??script:`, `???script:`, `????script:`) to `vbscript:` or `javascript:`.
*   **Weakness:** PHPIDS filters were not accounting for these IE-specific script tag variations.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary VBScript or JavaScript code in IE.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting specially crafted script tags within user-controlled input fields.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to inject user-controlled input that is processed by a vulnerable application and then displayed within a user's IE browser.

**2. `document.location.search` and `document.referrer`:**

*   **Root Cause:** PHPIDS filters did not filter the usage of  `document.location.search`  and `document.referrer`.
*   **Weakness:**  Attackers can inject malicious code in the URL, or through the referrer, and execute that code through the usage of `document.location.search` and `document.referrer`.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute JavaScript code by including it in the URL (using `document.location.search`) or the referring URL (using `document.referrer`).
*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious URLs can be sent through links or redirects to trick users to access a vulnerable page through a compromised link.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker would need to be able to control URLs, including referrers, to inject malicious content into the application.

**3. Bypassing `location.hash` rule:**

*  **Root Cause:** A specific filter rule was designed to detect self-contained XSS payload attacks using `location.hash` with `substr` or `replace`.
*   **Weakness:** The rule can be bypassed with more complex code, such as splitting and joining the `location.hash` or using a different way to access a substring.
    * `document.location.hash.split(document.location.hash.charAt(0)).join()`
    * `document.location.hash[String().substr.toString().substr(9,6)](1)`
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to bypass the XSS filter and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting payloads that leverage the above bypasses of the filter rule.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code into the `location.hash` portion of the URL.

**4. Bypassing common script method rule:**

*   **Root Cause:** A filter was designed to detect common JavaScript methods like `alert`, `prompt`, `confirm`, etc.
*   **Weakness:** Attackers can use `window[eval.toString().substr(9,4)]` or `Function()` to bypass the filter and call `eval` or run a function.
    * `window[eval.toString().substr(9,4)](--code_here--)`
    * `Function(--code_here--)();`
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code by bypassing the filters.
*   **Attack Vector:** By using a `Function` constructor or the `eval` function to execute code passed as a string by the attacker.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to inject code that uses string manipulation to construct code execution.

**5. Attribute Injection Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of quote characters within HTML attributes.
*   **Weakness:** By injecting a string like `x' y" z" awesome"whatever='something'`, an attacker can inject arbitrary attributes into HTML elements.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject custom attributes into HTML elements which can potentially be used for various attacks like injecting style to modify the appearance of the webpage, although some specific event attributes are blocked. The document also suggests that if an `<img>` tag were targeted it could be more severely exploited.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting a crafted string containing single and double quotes into a vulnerable attribute value.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker would need to inject a payload that included a variety of quotes that are not handled correctly by the sanitization.

**6. `with` Statement Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The usage of the javascript `with` statement was not filtered
*   **Weakness:** The filter does not handle the `with` statement
*    **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute javascript code by using the `with` keyword, such as `with(document)location.href=cookie;`
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting a javascript payload that includes the `with` statement.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  An attacker needs to inject code containing the `with` statement.

**7. Newline Handling Vulnerability**
*   **Root Cause:**  Error in handling new lines
*   **Weakness:** When parsing code with newlines the filter does not work as expected
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute javascript code that includes new lines, for example by using `for each(screw in window)try{screw(code)}catch(rock_and_roll){1}`
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting a javascript payload that includes new lines.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to inject code containing new lines.
