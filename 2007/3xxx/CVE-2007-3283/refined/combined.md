# [XScreenSaver](./) FAQ

---

These FAQs apply to the X11 version of XScreenSaver (Linux, BSD, etc.)

Please also read the [**manual**](man1.html).

This document answers the questions that are answered in the manual that
people ask about a lot anyway, plus some random other questions that didn't
really seem to fit in the manual itself.

If you think you have found a bug, please let me know! The
**[Bugs](bugs.html)** page explains how to submit a useful bug
report. But the ***very first thing you should do*** is try the
latest version, which is **6.09**, to see if the bug is
already fixed. *Particularly* if you are not yet using version 6.

Depending on your distro, the latest version (**6.09**)
might not be easily available to you. If that's the case, that means your
distro sucks. You can always [download the source](download.html)
and compile it yourself.

2. **It keeps asking me to upgrade but my distro doesn't have a
   newer version.**

   Alas, this shitshow is ongoing. You can read about it
   [over on my blog](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2016/04/i-would-like-debian-to-stop-shipping-xscreensaver/).

   If you are using Debian, install the newer version from their
   so-called
   ["unstable"
   packages](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/xscreensaver). Scroll down, find the `.deb` package of
   **6.09** for your architecture, and install that.

   The Debian maintainers think that it's reasonable to package and
   redistribute software to their users that is *years* old
   without giving them any easy way to upgrade to a recent version.
   This is bad and they should feel bad. You should use distros that
   give you the option of keeping your software up to date, and that
   understand that "stable" and "ancient" are not the same thing.

   If you are using an out-of-date Red Hat / Fedora / CentOS based system,
   you can probably find recent XScreenSaver executables at
   [rpmfind.net](http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=xscreensaver).

   If you can't find version **6.09** in any of those
   places, then you'll have to build from [source](download.html).
3. **My distro switched me to Wayland and now nothing works.**

   Yes, it is an absolute disaster. The XScreenSaver manual
   [explains why XScreenSaver does not and cannot work
   properly under Wayland](man1.html#17), and contains instructions for switching back
   from Wayland to X11. (For as long as that continues to work.)

   Fixing this requires changes to Wayland itself, not merely to
   XScreenSaver.

   I have been warning about this problem since 2021, and wrote in some
   detail about the technical issues
   [on my blog in 2023.](https://www.jwz.org/blog/2023/09/wayland-and-screen-savers/) Wayland *could* be improved to allow screen
   savers to continue to exist, but it appears that the Wayland developers have
   no interest in fixing this regression.
4. **How do I make XScreenSaver show a slideshow of images?**

   Just select **"GLSlideshow"** in the [XScreenSaver
   control panel](man2.html), and enter the directory (or RSS URL) where your images
   live on the "Advanced" tab. It displays a sequence of images, slowly
   panning and zooming through them, and fading smoothly from one image to the
   next.

   If you want to *only* run a slideshow, then select
   GLSlideshow in "Only One Screen Saver" mode. Otherwise, the
   slideshow it will be just one of the display modes that XScreenSaver
   will select from randomly, and run for the length of time specified
   in the *"cycle"* preference.

   If you try to use a third-party program to display images instead
   of just using GLSlideshow, you are setting yourself up for
   frustration and disappointment. So probably don't try to do that.
5. **How do I make XScreenSaver play a video clip?**

   Install [**mpv**](https://mpv.io/) and add something like
   the following to the *"programs"* preference in your
   `.xscreensaver` file:

   ```

        "Movies"  mpv --really-quiet --no-audio --fs --loop=inf  \
                      --no-stop-screensaver --shuffle            \
                      --wid=$XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW                 \
                      $HOME/Videos/poop.mp4                    \n\
   ```
   Or, point it at an **.m3u** file instead: a text file listing your
   video files, one per line.
6. **I used to be able to start typing my password before the unlock dialog
   had appeared, but now I have to wait for the prompt.**

   This is an inevitable consequence of the new security model introduced
   in XScreenSaver 6.00. The old behavior will not be returning, so get used
   to clicking the mouse or tapping "Shift" before you start typing your
   password.

   Just typing blindly had always been bad opsec anyway: if the screen was
   only blanked but not locked, you probably would have accidentally typed part
   of your password into another window.
7. **Where does the random text come from?**

   See the 'Advanced' tab on the
   [XScreenSaver control panel](man2.html).
8. **How do I run a particular program when the screen
   blanks/unblanks?**

   You can do that using **xscreensaver-command --watch**.
   See the [xscreensaver-command](man3.html) manual for
   an example.
9. **You crashed my X server! You bastard!**

   I'm sorry. But the fact is that an X server crash is, by
   definition, a bug in the X server.

   The rule is that absolutely *nothing* a client program
   throws at the X server should make it crash. When an X client does
   something wrong, the server is supposed to return an error, causing
   the client to exit. If the server itself goes down, that's a bug in
   the server. There may *also* be a bug in the client... but
   probably not.

   Try upgrading your X server and video drivers. If that doesn't
   help, you can try running each display mode in turn until you figure
   out which one is triggering the X server bug. It is most likely to
   be one of the OpenGL screensavers, since those are the ones that
   exercise your GPU. When you figure out which one is causing the
   crash, you now have a reproducible test case! Congratulations.
   Please report that to the vendor of your X server and/or your video
   drivers so that they can fix the problem.

   If that still brings you no joy, then I recommend switching to macOS.
   I did. The [macOS version of XScreenSaver](download.html)
   works great, incidentally, and has never, ever crashed my machine.
10. **The screensaver is not noticing my mouse wheel,
    and blanks while I'm doomscrolling!**

    Upgrade to XScreenSaver 6.00 or newer.
11. **The screen never blanks, or blanks and then unblanks right away.**

    The first possibility is that your mouse is getting bumped.
    Cats, trucks, doors, and earthquakes are likely culprits.

    Another possibility is that some other program on your system is
    explicitly instructing XScreenSaver to deactivate, or has requested that the
    screen never blank. Web browsers and movie players do this while playing
    video, but some of them will leave blanking inhibited forever if they crash.
    So if you had a video player crash, try killing and restarting the
    `xscreensaver-systemd` helper program and see if that fixes it.

    If that doesn't solve it, restart xscreensaver with `--log`
    (see the ["Reporting Bugs"](bugs.html) page) and see if
    it is reporting "user is active" or the receipt of "deactivate" events.
12. **The screen blanks, but sometimes (but not always) my monitor
    doesn't go into power-saving mode.**

    Short answer: your mouse is getting bumped. Cats, trucks,
    doors, and earthquakes are likely culprits.

    Slightly longer answer: XScreenSaver is responsible for blanking
    and locking the screen and drawing pretty pictures. However, the X
    server itself is responsible for powering down the monitor.
    XScreenSaver is smart enough to ignore tiny mouse motions: if your
    mouse only moves by a couple of pixels, XScreenSaver ignores that: it
    only un-blanks the screen when the mouse motion is large. However,
    the X server doesn't do that: even a single pixel of motion will cause
    it to power your monitor back on (or prevent your monitor from
    powering down in the first place.)

    The only way to fix this would be to modify the X server to
    do what XScreenSaver does, and ignore small mouse motions for
    power-management idle-detection purposes, but that will never happen.
13. **The OOM-killer killed XScreenSaver and my screen unlocked!**

    Linux systems have an
    [out-of-memory killer](https://lwn.net/Articles/104179/)
    that will start killing random processes in low-memory situations. You'd
    think it would pick the process using the most memory, but most of the
    time it seems to pick the process that would be most comically inconvenient,
    such as your screen locker, or `crond`.

    If XScreenSaver is installed setuid, it attempts to tell the OOM-killer
    to leave it alone. That may or may not work.

    You can disable the OOM-killer entirely by doing:

    `sudo sh -c 'echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory'

    sudo sh -c 'echo vm.overcommit_memory = 2
    >> /etc/sysctl.conf'`
14. **Programs sometimes pop up dialog boxes over the screen saver
    while my display is locked, and I wish they didn't.**

    This is a bug in your window manager and/or that application, and there
    is little that XScreenSaver can do about it. If this is happening it is
    because of one of two reasons:
    1. The window manager is placing windows on screen
       with `XRaiseWindow`, meaning, "place this window atop all others,
       including the screen saver." This is wrong.

       What it should be doing instead is ordering its windows using
       `XRestackWindows`, the semantics of which are, "here is the list of
       windows I manage, and the order in which they should be stacked." By
       using `XRestackWindows`, the window manager will never alter the
       stacking order of non-managed windows that are not within its remit.
    2. The application is using an `OverrideRedirect`
       window, explicitly hiding its pop-up window from the window manager. This
       is also wrong.

       Pop-ups, notifications, and all similar windows should be mapped as
       `WM_TRANSIENT_FOR`
       and/or `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG` windows,
       as has been explained by the
       [ICCCM](https://x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/xorg-docs/specs/ICCCM/icccm.html)
       and the
       [FreeDesktop](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/wm-spec/)
       [EWMH](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/1.3/ar01s05.html#id-1.6.7)
       specifications for decades.

    XScreenSaver can't prevent such improperly-mapped windows from appearing
    on screen, but it does slightly mitigate that by raising itself above them
    every few minutes. The real fix is for your window manager to not allow
    this to happen in the first place.
15. **Shouldn't XScreenSaver disable Ctrl-Alt-Backspace while the
    screen is locked?**

    Yes, it should. Unfortunately, that's not possible with any
    version of the Xorg server. It's as if the developers of X11 and
    the Linux kernel want to make it as hard as possible for you to lock
    your screen. There are numerous backdoor keystrokes that your distro
    may have "helpfully" enabled on your system. They are described in the
    "[**Security**](man1.html#15)" section of the manual.
16. **How do I unlock my screen with RFID or NFC or a fingerprint
    reader or retina scanner or something?**

    You can accomplish these things and more by installing the proper
    PAM module. XScreenSaver doesn't need to be modified at all, since it
    simply asks the PAM stack to authenticate. Doing it this way also
    means that the console login prompt can also be made to authenticate
    in the same way, not just XScreenSaver. Check out

    [PAM NFC](http://nfc-tools.org/index.php?title=Pam_nfc)
    or similar projects.
17. **The demo that's running right now is cool, how do I find out
    which one it is?**

    Run the [xscreensaver-settings](man2.html) program:
    when its window comes up, one of the elements in the list of display
    modes will be highlighted by default. That is the one that was most
    recently running.
18. **When XScreenSaver kicks in, my machine gets slow. Is there a
    way to tell it to not run graphics demos?**

    You can still blank and/or lock your screen, while denying
    yourself the pleasure of graphical screen savers, by running
    [xscreensaver-settings](man2.html) and selecting "Blank
    Screen Only" from the "Mode" option menu.

    The real problem is almost certainly that your X server is
    not making use of your GPU. Fix that instead.
19. **How do I prevent XScreenSaver from blanking the screen when
    I'm watching movies on my computer?**

    This happens automatically with recent versions of XScreenSaver
    and all of: Firefox, Chrome, Chromium and VLC.
    You need [XScreenSaver 5.45](download.html) or later, and
    systemd 221 or later or elogind.

    If that's not working, and you are unable to upgrade:

    When you want to watch a movie, fire up
    [xscreensaver-settings](man2.html) and select
    **Mode: Disable Screen Saver** from the option menu, which means
    not to blank the screen at all. When you're done watching the movie,
    re-select your previous mode.

    If you're using MPV, use VLC instead.

    If you are trying to use XFCE's "Presentation Mode"... don't.
    It breaks everything. Use XScreenSaver's "Disable Screen Saver"
    mode instead.
20. **I opened my laptop lid and the screen hadn't locked!**

    Recent versions of XScreenSaver automatically lock on suspend.
    You need [XScreenSaver 5.43](download.html) or later, and
    systemd 221 or later or elogind.

    If that's not working, and you are unable to upgrade, then the short
    answer is, "lock your screen before closing the lid".

    The longer answer is that what is happening is this:

    1. Your screen is not locked.
    2. You close the lid.
    3. The CPU halts.
    4. Hours pass.
    5. You open the lid.
    6. The CPU starts running again.
    7. The X server re-draws the previous screen contents.
    8. Oh hey, the screen is still not locked, because the machine
       is just like it was before, except that now the disk is thrashing
       because everything is trying to run at once.
    9. Eventually, the XScreenSaver process is scheduled again,
       and notices that the wall-clock has jumped by hours.
    10. Then XScreenSaver says "oh shit!" and locks the screen.

    What you are experiencing is the gap between steps 7 and 10.

    XScreenSaver's systemd integration fixes
    this by arranging for **"[xscreensaver-command](man3.html)
    --suspend"** to be run between steps 2 and 3.
21. **The manual says that XScreenSaver will stop running graphics
    demos when my monitor goes into power-saving mode, but it
    doesn't. Why?**

    This happens automatically if your X server supports the DPMS
    extension. It may take a minute to notice.

    If the Power Management settings in the Preferences panel are
    grayed out, then that means that either: XScreenSaver was compiled
    without DPMS support; or XScreenSaver believes that your system
    does not support power management.
22. **The unlock dialog is funny looking, why not use GTK?**

    The short answer is, for security reasons. The unlock dialog
    is implemented using raw Xlib because it would be very difficult
    to implement it using a GUI toolkit and still have XScreenSaver
    be secure. More technical details can be found on the
    [On Toolkits](toolkits.html) page.

    The look of that dialog is *somewhat* customizable. See the
    *"Theme"* menu in [xscreensaver-settings](man2.html).
    You can add new themes by editing the XScreenSaver.ad app-defaults file.
23. **I'm running GNOME or KDE, and everything's broken! What's wrong?**

    Probably you are not running XScreenSaver at all, but
    but are running "gnome-screensaver" or "kscreensaver" instead.
    You should stop.

    XScreenSaver is secure, stable, and mature; whereas
    gnome-screensaver is bug-ridden, unreliable, and an ongoing
    security disaster (for all the reasons outlined in the [On Toolkits](toolkits.html) page).

    Gnome-screensaver was created in 2005 by people who thought it
    was a better idea to rewrite all of XScreenSaver from scratch
    instead of sending me patches for the changes they desired in
    XScreenSaver itself.

    In 2011 or so, "gnome-screensaver" was forked and renamed as
    both "mate-screensaver" and "cinnamon-screensaver", re-arranging the
    deck chairs while fixing none of their fundamental design problems.

    Then in 2013, Ubuntu Unity re-wrote the screen saver engine
    from scratch *again*, introducing numerous security holes
    that would be hilarious if they weren't so sad.

    The only way to securely lock your screen under X11 is to turn off
    gnome-screensaver, mate-screensaver, cinnamon-screensaver, etc. and use
    XScreenSaver instead. How you go about this is explained in the
    "[**Installing on GNOME**](man1.html#9)" section of
    the [XScreenSaver manual](man1.html).

    Remember:
     Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence.
    Three times is enemy action. Four times is Official GNOME Policy.
24. **When I'm logged in as root, XScreenSaver won't lock my
    screen!**

    Don't log in as root. Proper Unix hygiene dictates that you should log
    in as yourself, and *sudo* as necessary. People who spend their day
    logged in as root are just begging for disaster.
25. **Some pedantic jerk told me that screen savers aren't really
    "necessary" any more?**

    How terrible it must be for them to have no soul.
    What has broken in their life to make them hate joy?
26. **I'm just learning to program X, and I want to write an
    XScreenSaver module. Where should I start?**

    The file "`README.hacking`" in the XScreenSaver
    [source distribution](download.html) contains some
    helpful hints.

    If you come up with anything, send it to me! If it's good, I'd
    love to include it in the XScreenSaver distribution.
