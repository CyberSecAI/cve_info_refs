{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Data Dynamics ActiveReport ActiveX control (actrpt2.dll) contains an insecure method named `SaveLayout()`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `SaveLayout()` method allows writing to arbitrary files. The ActiveX control is marked as 'Safe for Script' and 'Safe for Init', but does not implement IObjectSafety.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the user's system. The provided exploit overwrites the `system.ini` file rendering the system unusable.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote exploitation via a web page embedding the vulnerable ActiveX control.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a web page that contains the malicious code and lure a victim to visit this page using Internet Explorer. No other user interaction is explicitly required after page load."
