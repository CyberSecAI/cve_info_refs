Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the securityreason.com content:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-3705

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the `FTVAR_SUBCAT` parameter within the FuseTalk 2.0 forums software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability. The `FTVAR_SUBCAT` parameter, sent via the `txForumID` variable, allows 128 characters without any input sanitization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can directly query the database and disclose sensitive and confidential information, such as usernames, passwords, table structures, and other database contents.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Although not explicitly mentioned, SQL injection could potentially allow data modification or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely over HTTP.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `FTVAR_SUBCAT` parameter within the query string is the injection point.
*   **Specific URI Path:** The vulnerability was found on the path `/community/forum/index.cfm`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable FuseTalk forum.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Understanding of how HTTP GET requests and query strings function.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** An attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL queries.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered even if a session is not established, making it easier for an attacker to exploit.
*   Client-side JavaScript validation can be bypassed.
*   The error message reveals the parameter where direct SQL queries can be executed when a session is not established, further aiding attackers.
*  The affected software is Fusetalk 2.0 Forums with Microsoft SQL Server 2000
* The attack complexity is low, and no authentication is required.
