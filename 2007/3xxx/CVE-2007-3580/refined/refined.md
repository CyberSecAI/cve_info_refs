The provided content describes multiple potential XSS vulnerabilities and bypasses in the PHPIDS (PHP Intrusion Detection System) filter rules. Here's a breakdown:

**1. IE Script Tag Variations:**
    -   **Root Cause:** Internet Explorer translates variations of script tags such as `??script:`, `???script:`, and `????script:` into VBScript and JavaScript.
    -   **Weakness:** PHPIDS filters do not account for this IE specific behavior and fail to block such attacks.
    -   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts using IE specific script variations.
    -   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting URLs or inputs containing the mentioned variations of script tags

**2.  `document.location.search` and `document.referrer`:**
    -   **Root Cause:** Lack of filtering for `document.location.search` and `document.referrer`.
    -   **Weakness:** PHPIDS does not filter the content of these properties.
    -   **Impact:** Attackers can inject malicious code via GET parameters (`document.location.search`) or referrer headers (`document.referrer`).
    -   **Attack Vector:**  Redirecting a user to a vulnerable page with malicious code in the URL hash or referrer.
    -   **Attacker Capability:** Ability to control the URL hash or the referrer header of the request.

**3. VBScript Vulnerability:**
    -   **Root Cause:** The filter doesn't validate for VBScript.
    -   **Weakness:** Lack of filtering for VBScript code.
    -  **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject and execute VBScript code.
    -  **Attack Vector:** Injecting VBScript code into the application.

**4.  Bypassing  `location.hash` rule:**
    -   **Root Cause:** The filter uses regular expressions that can be bypassed using string manipulation.
    -   **Weakness:** The regular expression `(?:(?:location)?[. ]\*hash[. ]\*(?:substr(?:ing)?|replace)\s?\()` can be bypassed using `document.location.hash.split(document.location.hash.charAt(0)).join()` or `document.location.hash[String().substr.toString().substr(9,6)](1)`.
    -   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute code embedded within the `location.hash`.
    -   **Attack Vector:** Passing crafted strings using the hash of a URL
     -  **Attacker Capability:** Ability to control the URL hash.

**5. Bypassing alert/prompt/confirm/etc rule:**
    -  **Root Cause:** The filter uses a regular expression to detect script methods that can be bypassed with string manipulation.
    -  **Weakness:** The regular expression `(?:(?:alert|prompt|confirm|dialog|expression|urn|fromCharcode|decodeURIComponent...)` can be bypassed by using `window[eval.toString().substr(9,4)](--code_here--)` or `Function(--code_here--)();`.
    -  **Impact:** Allows execution of malicious JavaScript using string manipulation.
    -  **Attack Vector:** Injecting javascript function calls using string manipulation
    -   **Attacker Capability:** Ability to inject code.

**6. Attribute Injection Vulnerability:**
    -   **Root Cause:** Improper handling of quotes and spaces in HTML attributes.
    -   **Weakness:** The filter doesn't handle complex quote scenarios such as `x' y" z" awesome"whatever='something'` which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary attributes to HTML elements.
    -   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML attributes and potentially inject malicious code within the attribute.
    -   **Attack Vector:** Injecting crafted strings into attributes.

**7. "with" Statement Vulnerability:**
    -   **Root Cause:** The `with` keyword is not filtered by PHPIDS.
    -   **Weakness:** PHPIDS does not block the javascript `with` statement which can be used for code execution.
    -   **Impact:** Allows execution of arbitrary code by leveraging `with` statement.
    -   **Attack Vector:**  Injecting Javascript code that utilizes the `with` statement.

**8. Newline Handling Flaw**
   -  **Root Cause:** Error in handling newlines in javascript code.
   -  **Weakness:** Newlines can be used to bypass filters via code concatenation.
   -  **Impact:** Allows for code execution with the use of newlines and the concatenation of strings.
   -  **Attack Vector:** Injecting multi-line code

**Summary of extracted vulnerabilities:**

-  **XSS via IE Script Variations:** Bypassing filters using IE specific script tags.
- **XSS via `document.location.search` and `document.referrer`:** Injecting code via URL or referrer headers.
-  **VBScript Execution:** Bypassing filters to inject and execute VBScript.
-  **Bypassing `location.hash` Filter:** Using string manipulation to avoid detection of `location.hash` attacks
-  **Bypassing common script method filter:** Using string manipulation to avoid detection of common script methods
-  **Arbitrary Attribute Injection:** Injecting attributes into HTML tags.
-  **XSS via "with" Statement:** Injecting Javascript code that utilizes the `with` statement.
-  **XSS via Newline and Concatenation:** Using newlines to bypass filters.
