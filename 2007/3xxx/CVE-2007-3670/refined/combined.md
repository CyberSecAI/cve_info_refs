spinning out from [Bug 389613](/show_bug.cgi?id=389613 "RESOLVED FIXED - back-port -osint logic from bug 384384 to 1.8.0 branch").
Stephen and I actually put a bunch of comments in [Bug 389613](/show_bug.cgi?id=389613 "RESOLVED FIXED - back-port -osint logic from bug 384384 to 1.8.0 branch") over the weekend, but we really should have broken this issue out into a new bug for triage purposes so I'm doing that now.
"Stephen identified a problem with this fix. On the 1.5.0.x branch, we compare
the application path and nothing else when determining if the app is still the
default. Thus, a user who is running 1.5.0.12 as the default and gets upgraded
to 1.5.0.13, won't get the osint flag written out to the registry for the
appropriate keys. You need to unset, then set Thunderbird as the default mail
client for the keys to get written out.
This isn't a problem when testing:
1.5.0.12 and 1.5.0.13 using clean VMs for each test.
1.5.0.12 and a debug 1.5.0.13 with the fix.
Note: the behavior of detecting default client status based on the application
path and not the command line arguments as well has changed on the 1.8.1 branch
so this isn't an issue there. It's specific to 1.8.0."Flags: blocking1.8.0.14?

Same comment I put in [Bug 389613](/show_bug.cgi?id=389613 "RESOLVED FIXED - back-port -osint logic from bug 384384 to 1.8.0 branch"):
"Here's a fix that seems to address the spot where the default client status
isn't changing, causing us to fail to write out the osint flags.
It's a brute force approach for sure, but this is for the 1.8.0 branch only,
and this approach has a lot less risk than modifying the different ways in
which we detect default app status for mailto, news, nntp, snews and feed urls.
Every time 1.5.0.x starts up, for each protocol the current application
instance is the default for, re-write out the registration keys. And re-write
out the protocol key giving us default status with the OS."

Repeating the testing comments over in: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=389613#c49](/show_bug.cgi?id=389613#c49 "RESOLVED FIXED - back-port -osint logic from bug 384384 to 1.8.0 branch")
Here's what I did to test the brute force patch:
(either a clean VM or make sure the mailto, nntp, news, feed and snews keys
don't have -osint already in the registry)
1) Downloaded a nightly 1.5.0.13pre build from before the original fix went in
like this one:
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/thunderbird/nightly/2007-07-31-06-mozilla1.8.0/thunderbird-1.5.0.13pre.en-US.win32.installer.exe
2) Make sure this installation is the default mail, news and feed client.
3) Verify that the test case still fails and the profile manager comes up.
4) Now check for updates and get updated to the latest update.
5) Restart to install the update
6) Quit thunderbird
7) you can manually inspect HKLM\mailto, HKLM\news, etc. to see that the -osint
is now written out into the registry.
8) Run the test case again and verify that nothing comes up.

and since I temporarily checked in the brute force patch onto the branch so we could test it this weekend, here are Stephen's findings copied from [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=389613#c50](/show_bug.cgi?id=389613#c50 "RESOLVED FIXED - back-port -osint logic from bug 384384 to 1.8.0 branch"):
I can \*finally\*, \*truly\* verify this bug as fixed, using Scott's instructions
in [comment 49](/show_bug.cgi?id=393823#c49 "RESOLVED FIXED - -osint logic not written out to the windows registry when using software update on the 1.8.0 branch"), above.
C:\PROGRA~1\MOZILL~1\THUNDE~1.EXE -osint -compose %1 gets set under:
My Computer\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\Mail\Mozilla
Thunderbird\protocols\mailto\shell\open\command
Using the pre-fix build (2007-07-31-06 of mozilla1.8.0), I see the Profile
Manager invoked when running the testcase in [comment 43](/show_bug.cgi?id=393823#c43 "RESOLVED FIXED - -osint logic not written out to the windows registry when using software update on the 1.8.0 branch"). Post-fix, after
upgrading to 2007-08-26-04, I can see that not even the compose window comes
up, which I think is the expected outcome given Scott's step #8 in [comment 49](/show_bug.cgi?id=393823#c49 "RESOLVED FIXED - -osint logic not written out to the windows registry when using software update on the 1.8.0 branch").

Does this hack need to go into Tbird 2.0 as well, or is it just an issue with 1.5-era installers?

### Problem description

This update brings Mozilla Firefox to security update version 2.0.0.5

Following security problems were fixed:

* MFSA 2007-18: Crashes with evidence of memory corruption The usual collection of stability fixes for crashes that look suspicious but haven't been proven to be exploitable. 25 were in the browser engine, reported by Mozilla developers and community members Bernd Mielke, Boris Zbarsky, David Baron, Daniel Veditz, Jesse Ruderman, Lukas Loehrer, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren, Olli Pettay, Paul Nickerson,and Vladimir Sukhoy (CVE-2007-3734) 7 were in the JavaScript engine reported by Asaf Romano, Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov (CVE-2007-3735)
* MFSA 2007-19 / CVE-2007-3736: XSS using addEventListener and setTimeout moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that scripts could be injected into another site's context by exploiting a timing issue using addEventLstener or setTimeout.
* MFSA 2007-20 / CVE-2007-3089: frame spoofing Ronen Zilberman and Michal Zalewski both reported that it was possible to exploit a timing issue to inject content into about:blank frames in a page.
* MFSA 2007-21 / CVE-2007-3737: Privilege escallation using an event handler attached to an element not in the document Reported by moz\_bug\_r\_a4.
* MFSA 2007-22 / CVE-2007-3285: File type confusion due to %00 in name Ronald van den Heetkamp reported that a filename URL containing %00 (encoded null) can cause Firefox to interpret the file extension differently than the underlying Windows operating system potentially leading to unsafe actions such as running a program.
* MFSA 2007-23 / CVE-2007-3670: Remote code execution by launching Firefox from Internet Explorer Greg MacManus of iDefense and Billy Rios of Verisign independently reported that links containing a quote (") character could be used in Internet Explorer to launch registered URL Protocol handlers with extra command-line parameters. Firefox and Thunderbird are among those which can be launched, and both support a "-chrome" option that could be used to run malware. This problem does not affect Linux.
* MFSA 2007-24 / CVE-2007-3656: unauthorized access to wyciwyg:// documents Michal Zalewski reported that it was possible to bypass the same-origin checks and read from cached (wyciwyg) documents
* MFSA 2007-25 / CVE-2007-3738: XPCNativeWrapper pollution shutdown and moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported two separate ways to modify an XPCNativeWrapper such that subsequent access by the browser would result in executing user-supplied code.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-23

## Remote code execution by launching Firefox from Internet Explorer

Announced
July 17, 2007
Reporter
Greg MacManus and Billy Rios
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 2.0.0.5
* SeaMonkey 1.1.4
* Thunderbird 1.5.0.13
* Thunderbird 2.0.0.5

### Description

Internet Explorer calls registered URL protocols without escaping quotes and may be used to pass unexpected and potentially dangerous data to the application that registers that URL Protocol.

The vulnerability is exposed when a user browses to a malicious web page in Internet Explorer and clicks on a specially crafted link. That link causes Internet Explorer to invoke another Windows program via the command line and then pass that program the URL from the malicious webpage without escaping the quotes. Firefox and Thunderbird are among those which can be launched, and both support a "-chrome" option that could be used to run malware.

Other Windows applications can be called in this way and also manipulated to execute malicious code. This fix only prevents Firefox and Thunderbird from accepting bad data. **This patch does not fix the vulnerability in Internet Explorer.**

### Workaround

Mozilla highly recommends using Firefox to browse the web to prevent attackers from exploiting this problem in Internet Explorer.

# Security Issue in URL Protocol Handling on Windows

Window Snyder
July 10, 2007

[24 responses](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2007/07/10/security-issue-in-url-protocol-handling-on-windows/#comments)

Today security firm Secunia released an advisory on a security issue found (apparently) simultaneously and independently by Greg MacManus and Billy Rios based on a previously reported issue in Safari found by Thor Larholm.

Any Windows application that calls a registered URL protocol without escaping quotes may be used to pass unexpected and potentially dangerous data to the application that registers that URL Protocol. This could result in a critical security vulnerability.

The vulnerability is exposed when a user browses to a malicious web page in Internet Explorer and clicks on a specially crafted link. That link causes Internet Explorer to invoke another Windows program via the command line and then pass that program the URL from the malicious webpage without escaping the quotes. This can cause data to be passed accidentally from the malicious web page to the second Windows program. In the specific attack described in the report, Internet Explorer sends URL data to Firefox. If the data is crafted a certain way it will allow remote code execution in Firefox.

A similar interaction between Safari and Firefox was reported earlier and fixed by Apple. According to Ryan Naraine at ZDNet, Microsoft is not planning to release a patch at this time.

Mozilla believes in defense in depth and will be patching Firefox in the upcoming 2.0.0.5 release to mitigate the problem. This will prevent IE from sending Firefox malicious data. Other Windows programs may also be vulnerable to bad data being passed from IE although we are not aware of any at this time.

It is important to note that if you are using Firefox to browse the web you \***are not**\* vulnerable to this attack. While we have seen no evidence of attackers exploiting this issue, there is proof of concept code available publicly. So we recommend that people use Firefox and as always take care when browsing unknown websites.

We appreciate the work of the security researchers who identified this issue and the thousands of Mozilla community members who test patches and enable us to ship fixes so quickly. Mozilla is committed to identifying, prioritizing and fixing bugs to deliver the safest online experience for its users. We fix all bugs with any security risk as part of our commitment to security.

## Mozilla Firefox URL protocol handling vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#358017

Original Release Date: 2007-07-11 | Last Revised: 2007-07-19

---

### Overview

Mozilla Firefox protocol handlers may allow remotely supplied JavaScript to execute with elevated privileges. This may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| On Microsoft Windows systems, Mozilla Firefox installs protocol handlers for Mozilla-specific protocols, such as the FirefoxURL and FirefoxHTML protocols. If Microsoft Windows encounters a URL protocol it cannot handle natively it searches the Windows registry for the appropriate protocol handler. When the correct protocol handler is found, Windows passes it the URL string. By design Windows passes the URL string to the protocol handler as it was received without performing any sanitization.  Mozilla Firefox URL protocol handlers are constructed in a way that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript with elevated ([chrome](http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe/ConfigChromeSpec.html)) privileges. Mozilla Firefox security restrictions detect and prevent the execution of such JavaScript. However, if a remote attacker can persuade a user with Firefox installed to access a specially crafted web page using Internet Explorer, and perhaps other Windows applications, the malicious JavaScript will be executed. Reports claim this vulnerability is introduced when Firefox versions 2.0.0.2 and later are installed.Exploit code is publicly available for this vulnerability. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute JavaScript with elevated ([chrome](http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe/ConfigChromeSpec.html)) privileges. This essentially means that the attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Mozilla has addressed this vulnerability in Firefox [2.0.0.5](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox%3A2.0.0.5). |
| --- |

| **Unregister the** **Firefox** **protocols**  Disabling the Mozilla Firefox protocol handlers will mitigate this vulnerability. To unregister the protocol handlers, delete or rename the following registry keys:HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\FirefoxURLHKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\FirefoxHTMLModifying the Windows registry may have unintended consequences and should be done with care. |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-40

## Upgraded Thunderbird 1.5.0.13 missing fix for MFSA 2007-23

Announced
December 19, 2007
Reporter
Stephen Donner
Impact
Critical
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 1.5.0.14

### Description

Mozilla tester **Stephen Donner** reported that only users
who installed Thunderbird 1.5.0.13 using the install package received
the fix for [MFSA 2007-23](mfsa2007-23.html). Users who upgraded
to Thunderbird 1.5.0.13 from an earlier version using the automatic update
mechanism were not protected. If those users browsed the internet using
Internet Explorer or another similarly affected program and clicked on a
malicious `mailto:` link the attacker could potentially execute
arbitrary code.

### Workaround

Mozilla highly recommends using Firefox to browse the web to prevent
attackers from exploiting this problem in Internet Explorer.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Security researchers can't decide whether it's in IE or Firefox

A serious vulnerability that causes Internet Explorer to launch Firefox and execute a malicious payload is sparking debate about exactly who is responsible for the flaw.

The vulnerability, which was widely reported on security blogs, allows an attacker to remotely execute malicious code on a machine that is running IE but also has the Mozilla browser installed. By luring an IE user to a malevolently crafted site, the attacker can cause Firefox to execute the code without first vetting it for security.

The saying about success having many parents but failure being an orphan seems fitting here. Window Snyder, who heads security at Mozilla, [wrote today](http://blog.mozilla.com/security/2007/07/10/security-issue-in-url-protocol-handling-on-windows/) that Mozilla developers will patch Firefox so it no longer accepts bad data from IE. But she stressed that only people browsing with the Microsoft browser were vulnerable to the attack.

"We recommend that people use Firefox and as always take care when browsing unknown websites," she wrote.

For its part, Microsoft representatives said company researchers have "investigated the claim of a vulnerability in Internet Explorer and found that this is not a vulnerability in a Microsoft product." Jesper Johansson, a former senior security strategist for Microsoft, similarly argues that "most definitely" the problem isn't caused by IE.

"Firefox fails to properly validate the parameters, and any fix will have to come from Mozilla, not Microsoft," he [wrote](http://msinfluentials.com/blogs/jesper/archive/2007/07/10/blocking-the-firefox-gt-ie-0-day.aspx) in a blog entry.

A proof of concept exploit [found here](http://www.xs-sniper.com/sniperscope/IE-Pwns-Firefox.html) uses IE to hand off maliciously-scripted code to a Firefox handler known as "firefoxurl." Handlers, which also include strings such as "ftp" and "aim," are found in the address bar and in many cases can be used to get Firefox to carry out certain actions.

Roger Thompson, CTO of Exploit Prevention Labs, says Microsoft shares culpability because IE fails to properly validate the input before passing it along.

"I think it's an IE issue mostly, because if you access the exploit directly with Firefox, FF warns you that something bad is happening and advises you to not do it," he said in an instant message. ®

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=384384#c0)• 18 years ago |
|  | |

iDefense reports a security problem that arises from a combination of IE7 and Firefox 2. The attached PoC was unreadable (working on getting a copy) but the description sounds like Thor Larholm's Safari-for-Windows exploit blogged at <http://larholm.com/2007/06/12/safari-for-windows-0day-exploit-in-2-hours/> and is presumably similar.
Excerpt:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
II. DESCRIPTION
Remote exploitation of an input handling vulnerability in the handling
of external application URIs by multiple browsers could allow remote
code execution as the local user.
A remote attacker can cause an Internet Explorer user, with Mozilla
Firefox installed, to execute arbitrary commands. By creating an iFrame
with a specially constructed link, attackers may execute arbitrary
programs and files may be downloaded, uploaded, or modified as the
current user.
This vulnerability is due to the interaction between programs. Internet
Explorer does not escape double-quote characters in some URLs. This can
allow a specially constructed link to be interpreted by Firefox as
multiple arguments.
III. ANALYSIS
Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute
arbitrary commands as the current user. To exploit this vulnerability,
the attacker must create a website containing a maliciously constructed
link. The victim must have Firefox installed, but not currently running.
When Internet Explorer requests a frame with a 'firefoxurl:' URI,
Internet Explorer will launch Firefox with the arguments supplied from
the SRC (source) parameter.
When opening a URL, Firefox is started with the following command line:
[path/to/firefox.exe] -url "%1" -requestPending
The "%1" is replaced with the source URL. If the URL contains a
double-quote character followed by a space, the quoting will be closed,
and the rest of the source URL will be treated as new arguments. By
supplying the '-chrome' (user interface) option, followed by JavaScript
that calls XPCOM interface functions, an attacker can execute arbitrary
commands.
XPCOM (Cross Platform Component Object Model) is the framework used by
Mozilla-based products that allow the same base code to be used for
multiple applications on multiple platforms. The XPCOM user interface
code for Firefox accesses the underlying code on the system, providing
a standardized interface across operating systems. Code interacting
with the browser at this level can perform any operation the user
running the browser can.
This vulnerability is related to a similar vulnerability in the Beta
version of Apple's Safari Web browser for Windows.
In Vista with IE 7 in Protected Mode, which is the default setting, a
dialog will ask you to confirm that you want to run Firefox.
IV. DETECTION
iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability to be
exploitable with Firefox version 2.0.0.4 from Internet Explorer 7 on
Windows XPSP2. Previous versions may also be affected.
While this vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer not escaping
double-quotes in the URL passed to external programs, the actual code
execution comes from Firefox. The interaction between the two programs
is the source of this vulnerability.
V. WORKAROUND
iDefense is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue, other
than keeping Firefox running while browsing the Web with Internet
Explorer. iDefense Labs is researching other potential workarounds and
will update this report should any become available.
[...]
IX. CREDIT
This vulnerability was discovered by Greg MacManus (iDefense Labs).Flags: wanted1.8.1.x?Flags: blocking1.9?Flags: blocking1.8.1.5?

As mentioned I haven't see the PoC, but assuming it's like Larholm's I have to wonder why we allow javascript: urls with the -chrome command-line argument, or really anything but an actual chrome: url.
But we shouldn't focus on -chrome alone, there could be other problematic command-line arguments now or in the future we should protect. Perhaps require -url to be the last command-line argument if used and ignore any options that follow.Alias: IDEF2595

Does Firefox really register a "firefoxurl:" protocol? That's not very nice; it prevents users from safely using other browsers when Firefox has a known hole.

Given that the attacker is already executing commands on the target box, is it really worth changing Firefox to make it harder to use for this? Won't they just use some other app to do their dirty work instead?

We allow opening web content with the -chrome flag because it's a common operation on intranets. If anything, the bug is that the javascript URL gets chrome privs instead of about:blank privs, but I don't know how we pick a principal in that case.
Really though this has to be a windows/IE bug... there are many other ways this could be exploited given the number of commandline options we support, and they are obviuosly passing us bogus data.

> Given that the attacker is already executing commands on the target box,
The attacker is not, they have a web page with a URL in it.
It happens to be something that will cause IE to use an external handler (Larholm's Safari PoC used gopher:) and Firefox is the registered handler for that scheme. IE and Safari apparently are not escaping quotes properly, but Firefox accepts arguments wholly inappropriate for handling remote URLs.

Some other hypothetical handler that will turn an innocent text string into code execution? I doubt it. If they find a different vulnerability, though, hackers will definitely try that instead (a while back it was a buffer overrun in a default rtsp: handler; QuickTime I think, but maybe Real).
(In reply to [comment #2](/show_bug.cgi?id=384384#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Multiple Vendor Multiple Browser Interaction URI Handler Command Injection Vulnerability"))
> Does Firefox really register a "firefoxurl:" protocol?
We register HKLM/SOFTWARE/Classes/FirefoxURL with a shell/open/command subkey and then set the values of ftp, gopher, http, and https to FirefoxURL under HKLM/SOFTWARE/Clients/StartMenuInternet/FIREFOX.EXE/Capabilities/URLAssociations
This, amazingly, does cause firefoxurl: to be sent to Firefox, which then doesn't recognize it and loops trying to open it in an external app which turns out to be Firefox. Definitely do NOT want to check the "remember" box on \_that\_ one! We can stop the looping by setting network.protocol-handler.external.firefoxurl to false, but it's too late by then since the malicious -chrome command-line has already executed.
We seem to be the only browser setting the "Capabilities" key under StartMenuInternet, at least on WinXP -- is it a Vista thing? This was added for [bug 354005](/show_bug.cgi?id=354005 "RESOLVED FIXED - Setting the app as the OS default is broken on Vista")
If it's not a Vista requirement we should save our placeholders in a new place, because anything under HKR with a shell/open/command can be used as a scheme. (e.g. giffile://something will attempt to launch IE)
1) why do we register firefoxurl ?
2) even if we didn't, the problem still exists if Firefox is the default browser. Other browsers will slurp up http(s)/ftp regardless of default handler, but we've still got gopher: sitting out there.

I'd prefer to keep the original advisory title for the summary because people will eventually be searching for this once the advisory is public.
"passing spaces" isn't really the problem, it's the quotes.

This is a Vista requirement and we set it so that if the OS is upgraded to Vista from a previous OS we need these keys under HKLM for Vista integration. MS did a similar implementation for local files (see FirefoxHTML) a while back and added this for protocol handlers with Vista.

The Capabilities and FirefoxURL keys are under HKLM. You are seeing the abstracted HKCR which is a combination of HKLM and HKCU Software\Classes.

For Vista Integration.

Which is what windows uses to determine the "active" handlers, should some user have customized HKCU settings.

Vista requires that there be a way to launch any specific browser even if the user doesn't want that browser handling stuff by default? Does IE do the same thing on Vista (IE7 doesn't in WinXP)? Yowza, that means even if you've switched to Firefox people could try to launch IE exploits. Yes, we'll put up a dialog first but that's pretty thin protection.
Please let us know what key name IE uses, I'd like to set network.protocol-handler.external.<ieurl> to false in the default prefs to protect against this. Safari and Opera, too, if they do this on Vista.

Does this mean that any Named key under HKLM/SOFTWARE/Classes automatically becomes a protocol handler? That sounds like a pretty serious bug in Vista to me: There are many keys there that have nothing to do with URI protocols. That's a huge (and pretty stupid) attack vector.
On my system IE has "htmlfile" even when Firefox is my default browser.
Setting .external = false on whackamole bad handlers sounds like a bad way to deal with this.

and to point out that the statement of "we should save our placeholders in a new place" wouldn't work. The system level default value must be under HKLM\Software\Classes which is then abstracted to HKCR unless it is over-ridden by a value under HKCU\Software\Classes.

No, the purpose is to have a system level default for protocol handlers in the same way as earlier versions of windows expect a system level default for file handlers.

No. With Vista protocol handlers have a HKLM\Software\Classes key similar to how file handlers had a value there. There must also be a value name of URL Protocol for it to be a URL protocol.

Billy Rios of VeriSign independently reported similar abuse. At the following URL he has fun with various command-line options we support, several of which work even if Firefox is currently running.

following up to [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=384384#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Multiple Vendor Multiple Browser Interaction URI Handler Command Injection Vulnerability"), we're thinking that given an indication that "this is a call via a registered protocol/mimetype handler" we would only honor the -url commandline option (and perhaps a small whitelisted set of others).
We already register these handlers with -requestPending and that option has little use outside that context so we may be able to use that as our signal. But we'll have to reorder the options so that comes first before any potential bad quoting.

deveditz, I believe that nothing should be using firefoxurl as an -url param so how about if we just close that off completely by not handling any command line arguments when that is present instead of trying to handle the url and not handling specific arguments, etc.? btw: the url in [comment #14](/show_bug.cgi?id=384384#c14 "RESOLVED FIXED - Multiple Vendor Multiple Browser Interaction URI Handler Command Injection Vulnerability") is no longer available.

This patch doesn't handle the gopher / safari case. To properly handle urls when we need to restart during startup We remove requestPending so we can't use that to differentiate. We could do one of the following
1) add a new flag when we remove requestPending to handle that case
2) remove the gopher protocol reg keys when it points to our app
3) other?
There has been some discussion about removing the gopher protocol reg keys previously which is the direction I think we should take.
Also, I'm not entirely certain that the case when the app is already open and DDE is used isn't also vulnerable... I'll verify that tomorrow.

When using DDE I get the same results and we don't pass requestPending or any other flags via DDE so just using a command line flag isn't an option. The current patch already fixes launching with command line flags and DDE and the only additional thing that would need to be done is the removal of the gopher protocol reg keys.

the "hook" referred to his use of firefoxurl: which I didn't want to explicitly mention in unencrypted mail.

Outlook Express on WinXP SP2 has the same problem as IE, it'll launch these links from an HTML email. I wonder if the programs are simply calling ShellExecute() and trusting that to escape properly. That's probably the level it should be fixed at since that's the API constructing the command-line.
Outlook Express \_does\_ escape http: and ftp: urls so those are not an attack vector. But it does not escape the unknown firefoxurl: scheme.
rstrong reports that the default "WinMail" on Vista does \_not\_ have this problem so maybe they added escaping.
Opera 9.2 is safe, it escapes quotes.

patch rev 3
This patch seems incomplete. I'm glad we're blocking firefoxurl: as an obvious sign of evilness, but I strongly feel we should do what I suggest in [comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=384384#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - Multiple Vendor Multiple Browser Interaction URI Handler Command Injection Vulnerability"). That is (spelled out)
1) reorder the installed handlers so -requestPending is first (so it can't be messed with by injected content)
2) if we find -requestPending then we know we're a registered command-line handler and we MUST ignore all further options other than -url.
caveats: if -requestPending has other uses then we should invent a new option whose sole purpose is to signal this "I'm a registered handler" state.
rationale: IE happens to correctly escape http(s)/ftp/gopher URLS before (presumably) sending them to ShellExecute() so the injection trick isn't going to work, but that's no guarantee all other apps will do it. I really don't want to end up vulnerable later because acrobat/flash/aim/pidgin/<random RSS reader>/some-IRC-client get it wrong and don't escape http: urls, leading to the exact same -chrome exploit through a protocol we can't simply say is evil and not support. Also people could install firefox extentions that register additional protocol handlers that IE does not escape (for example, Chatzilla could register irc: and then here we are again)

As expected, the exploit works from within Firefox if <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1419> or similar is installed. NetScape should be vulnerable as well for obvious reasons, but I didn't check.
In the meanwhile, both the chrome privileged and the "normal" XSS tricks are prevented by the current NoScript development version, available from <http://noscript.net/getit#devel> and scheduled to be released in the mainstream tomorrow.

I've been considering this as well. The caveat you stated regarding requestPending is entirely true as stated in [comment #20](/show_bug.cgi?id=384384#c20 "RESOLVED FIXED - Multiple Vendor Multiple Browser Interaction URI Handler Command Injection Vulnerability") so a new flag will have to be used. On top of that we will most likely need to modify the reg key for DDE in order to prefix it with the new command line flag.

The approach I plan on taking for evaluating whether or not the command line is valid is to reorder the flags so they are -requestPending -newFlag -url "%1". The dde request will also include this new flag though I haven't decided yet the best way to implement this. If -newFlag (actual name not yet decided upon) is present only allow the -requestPending flag and the -url flag followed by the url param in the command line. If there are additional flags the entire operation will be a noop. Though we could just remove the additional flags I think this way is safer since the only time we should end up in this state is when an exploit is attempted.
Also, I think we should continue to make firefoxurl as a noop when it is passed in as the url param since this will prevent the app looping when it meets the aforementioned criteria above (e.g. -url "firefoxurl:<http://localhost/>").

Or some varation on "OS Integration" since that's what these are for?
-osint
-osi
-os

If we register anything similar on Mac and Linux we should add the same flag to prevent future issues on those OS's. How does Linux know to open Firefox when I click on a local .html file?

[branch patch ver 4](attachment.cgi?id=270052&action=diff) (obsolete)

— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=384384&attachment=270052)

Benjamin, this prevents invoking command line arguments in nsAppRunner if the -osint command line flag is present except for -help, -version, etc. since those return immediately. It also adds nsAllowedCheckCommandLineHandler to nsBrowserContentHandler.js with a category of a-allowedcheck so it should be called first. Not pretty but it should be safe.
For the trunk I think a new interface for validation should be added (e.g. nsICommandLineValidator) which would allow commandlinehandlers to opt in to be validators. It would be enumerated in the same way nsICommandLineHandler is enumerated and have one method for the validation of the commandline args. This would allow extension provided commandlinehandlers that add os integration to validate their arguments. We would still need the checks for -osint in nsAppRunner since it handles several commandline flags early in startup.
Thoughts?

I've got this working and just need to finish up the code comments... I'm happy to say that the trunk patch may very well be safe enough for the branch.

Scott, the logic in validate in nsMailDefaultHandler.js needs to be beefed up due to having to handle both a mail and compose flag. The MAPI calls will also have to be verified that it sets state to STATE\_REMOTE\_EXPLICIT.

patch rev 6 (diff from branch)
Are there any instances where CheckArg should work with "osint"? Can we just change the implementation of CheckArg to always check for "osint" and return ARG\_BAD if it is present? That means we'd have to teach a few callers about ARG\_BAD, but it would be less confusing than checking for "osint" in each case.

I considered that and went with this so the stderr output would be correct... I'll submit a new patch shortly implementing the check for osint in CheckArg. Thanks!

How pervasive is the use of -chrome on Intranets? I can't find any references to general usage of it, so perhaps it could simply be disabled by default with a preferences flag - then Intranets can enable it specifically.
For what it's worth, simply removing the "URL Protocol" value from the registry will prevent IE and any other applications from launching Firefox through FirefoxURL on XPSP2, without breaking additional functionality. I don't know about Vista, but it should still work just fine as the URL handler logic is not used for opening html files and the DefaultIcon is still in place.

Does this handle URLs which have correctly-encoded spaces in them? e.g.
in some app: <http://example.com/some%20file.html>
Does this get passed to Firefox as some%20file.html or some file.html?

Actually, all the CheckArg calls in HandleRemoteArgument should pass PR\_FALSE since the command line check that calls this passes PR\_TRUE.

It gets passed quoted via the reg entry value of:
<path to firefox.exe> -requestPending -osint -url "%1"
where %1 is replaced by the url.

After reading the following
<http://msinfluentials.com/blogs/jesper/archive/2007/07/10/blocking-the-firefox-gt-ie-0-day.aspx>
I realized we also need to remove the handler added by the MS shim.

[Comment 56](/show_bug.cgi?id=384384#c56 "RESOLVED FIXED - Multiple Vendor Multiple Browser Interaction URI Handler Command Injection Vulnerability") needs to be in a new follow-up bug. We've already shipped a release with what we thought was the fix, adding more blocking/fixed flags here would make a big mess.
Filed [bug 389287](/show_bug.cgi?id=389287 "RESOLVED FIXED - remove shim URL handler") to track that installer patch.

What does it mean that this is in "Core Graveyard" now? We still have this code, and could conceivably make a similar mistake in the future that would be a security hole we'd have to fix. How is that a "Graveyard"?

The cmd-line handling component is obsolete. I moved all open bugs in this component to the correct component and had the component moved to graveyard so that new bugs could not be opened in it.

Thunderbird vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

## Details

Various flaws were discovered in the layout and JavaScript engines. By

tricking a user into opening a malicious email, an attacker could execute

arbitrary code with the user's privileges. Please note that JavaScript

is disabled by default for emails, and it is not recommended to enable it.

([CVE-2007-3734](/security/CVE-2007-3734), [CVE-2007-3735](/security/CVE-2007-3735), [CVE-2007-3844](/security/CVE-2007-3844))

Jesper Johansson discovered that spaces and double-quotes were

not correctly handled when launching external programs. In rare

configurations, after tricking a user into opening a malicious email,

an attacker could execute helpers with arbitrary arguments with the

user's privileges. ([CVE-2007-3670](/security/CVE-2007-3670), [CVE-2007-3845](/security/CVE-2007-3845))
