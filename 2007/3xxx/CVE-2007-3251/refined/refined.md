Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3251:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from multiple flaws within the e-Vision CMS 2.02 application, including:

1.  **Unvalidated input in `admin/show_img.php`:** The script directly uses the `$_GET['img']` parameter in `fopen()` and `filesize()`. This allows an attacker to specify arbitrary files, potentially leading to arbitrary file reading.
2.  **Unvalidated input in `admin/functions.php`:** The script uses the `$_COOKIE['adminlang']` to include a language file, without proper sanitization, which allows an attacker to potentially include arbitrary files using a directory traversal technique.
3.  **SQL injection in `style.php`:** The script uses the `$_GET['template']` parameter directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Read:**  The vulnerability in `admin/show_img.php` allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `img` GET parameter.
2. **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** The vulnerability in `admin/functions.php` allows an attacker to include arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `adminlang` cookie. This can lead to Remote Code Execution.
3.  **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability in `style.php` allows an attacker to inject SQL code, potentially leading to database information disclosure (e.g., extracting admin username and password hashes).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files (like configuration files containing database credentials) and extract sensitive data from the database (admin usernames and password hashes).
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By combining the file inclusion vulnerability and log poisoning, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET requests:**  All vulnerabilities are exploited via crafted HTTP GET requests.
*   **Cookie manipulation:** The file inclusion vulnerability also uses HTTP Cookies.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   No prior authentication is required to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable e-Vision CMS application and its file structure.
