{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the way the application handles score data for games. Specifically, the application allows users to submit a score which is stored in a text file and then later included using the 'include()' function. By controlling the 'scoreid' parameter, an attacker can include a malicious file, leading to command execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unvalidated input leading to file inclusion.",
    "Lack of sanitization of user-provided data used in file paths.",
    "Insecure use of `include()` function with user-controlled input."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote command execution on the server. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "HTTP POST request to `snakep.php` to inject malicious code into a score file.",
    "HTTP POST request to `games.php` to create a shell.",
    "HTTP GET request to `games.php` to include the created shell.",
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Ability to send HTTP POST and GET requests to the vulnerable application.",
    "Knowledge of the vulnerable application's file structure and parameters."
