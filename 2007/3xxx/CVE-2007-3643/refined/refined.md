Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the insecure way AV Arcade 2.1b handles user authentication and authorization. Specifically, it directly uses the value of the `ava_userid` cookie to query the database for user information without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (Indirect):** Although not a direct SQL injection in the classic sense, the vulnerability arises because the application is directly embedding the user-controlled `ava_userid` cookie value into an SQL query. This enables attackers to manipulate the query by setting a crafted cookie.
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application relies on a user-controlled cookie value for authorization, trusting it without validation.
*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The code checks the `admin` flag based on the retrieved user data, but doesn't properly authenticate the user before making authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain full administrative privileges by setting the `ava_userid` cookie to `1`. This allows them to bypass the intended authentication mechanism, execute admin functionality, and fully control the application.
*   **Complete System Takeover:** With administrative access, an attacker could potentially modify user data, inject malicious content, or even gain access to the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker exploits this vulnerability by setting the `ava_userid` cookie to `1` in their browser.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely, requiring no access to the server or other user accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker only needs the ability to modify their browser's cookies and send HTTP requests to the vulnerable website.
*   No prior knowledge or specific authentication is required, making this vulnerability easily exploitable.

**Technical Details (from the provided content):**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is located in `admin/index.php`:
    ```php
    $sql = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM ava_users WHERE id=". $_COOKIE['ava_userid']."");
    while($row = mysql_fetch_array($sql)){
    if ($row['admin'] == 1) {
    define( 'ADMIN_ACCESS', 1 );
    [...]
    ```
*   The exploit is described as: "Set in your cookies: `ava_userid = 1;` and that's all."
*   The CVSS score is 10/10, indicating a critical severity, with complete impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   The attack complexity is low and no authentication is required.
