- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A specially crafted packet sent to the SNMPc service login causes a denial-of-service condition. The vulnerability is likely related to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue when processing the crafted packet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow or memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service of the SNMPc service.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted TCP packet to the vulnerable service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets to the vulnerable service, typically through a network connection, and needs to know the target port (165).
