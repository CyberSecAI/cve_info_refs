  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The TeamSpeak WebServer lacks TCP session expiration and does not perform checks on the length of incoming values.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Lack of TCP session expiration",
    "Insufficient input validation on the length of incoming values"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote denial of service (DoS). The attack causes 100% CPU usage and excessive memory consumption (1.2 GB per session).",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the /login.tscmd endpoint. The request includes oversized username, password, and serverport parameters in the form data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network connectivity to the target server and the ability to send HTTP POST requests."
