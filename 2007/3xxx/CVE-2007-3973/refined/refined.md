      "CVE": "CVE-2007-3973",
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_0ecef96c_20250125_031944.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a combination of insecure cookie handling and lack of authentication for admin functions in JBlog 1.0.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Cookie Manipulation: The 'theme' cookie can be manipulated to inject malicious code using meta tags, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).",
         "Authentication Bypass: The script allows creation of new administrator accounts via the `ajoutaut.php` script without proper authentication.",
         "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The `pcomm` parameter in `index.php` is vulnerable to XSS by injecting arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code."
        ],
      "impact": "An attacker can gain complete control of a vulnerable JBlog instance through remote privilege escalation by creating a new administrator account, as well as executing arbitrary code in the context of the victim user via XSS, and redirecting users to malicious websites via cookie manipulation.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST requests to `recherche.php` to manipulate the 'theme' cookie and inject malicious code",
        "HTTP GET requests to `index.php` with a malicious `pcomm` parameter for XSS",
        "HTTP POST requests to `admin/ajoutaut.php` to create new admin accounts."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable JBlog instance and should not be logged in into the application",
       "additional_details": "The exploit-db content provides an exploit code that demonstrates how to perform cookie manipulation via HTML meta tags, how to create a new admin user and how to delete admin users."
