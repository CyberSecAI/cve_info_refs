- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input sanitization and error handling in the search functionality of Gobi/Helma.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) and information disclosure.
-   **Impact of exploitation**:
    -   XSS: Allows attackers to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code via GET or POST forms, potentially leading to session cookie theft.
    -   Information Disclosure: Exposes the system path of Helma due to improper error handling, specifically when invalid characters are used in the search query.
-   **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through crafted GET requests to the search function, injecting malicious scripts, or providing invalid characters to trigger error messages.
-   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable search functionality. No specific privileges or access are needed.
