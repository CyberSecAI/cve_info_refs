Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `ShowImage.php` script of SiteDepth CMS 3.44.
*   The script directly uses the `$_GET['name']` parameter to construct a file path without proper sanitization or validation, leading to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `readfile()` function in `ShowImage.php` includes a file based on user-controlled input (`$_GET['name']`). The lack of input validation allows an attacker to manipulate this parameter to access arbitrary files on the server, including sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Disclosure:** An attacker can read the contents of any file accessible by the web server user. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including:
    *   System files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`)
    *   Application configuration files
    *   Database credentials
    *   Source code

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `ShowImage.php` script with a manipulated `name` parameter.
    *   Example: `http://noobie.com/sitedepth/ShowImage.php?name=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
