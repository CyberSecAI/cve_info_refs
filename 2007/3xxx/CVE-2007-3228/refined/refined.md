Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3228:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) flaw in the Sitellite CMS. The vulnerability is located in the `bug-559668.php` file within the `saf/lib/PEAR/PhpDocumentor/Documentation/tests/` directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The `bug-559668.php` file contains an `include` statement that uses a user-supplied parameter `FORUM[LIB]` to include a remote file:  `require_once $FORUM['LIB'] . '/classes/db/PearDb.php';`
- **Unprotected include:** The code directly includes the file specified by the user-controlled parameter without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Path Traversal:** The provided exploit example shows `xxx.com\path\saf\lib\PEAR\PhpDocumentor\Documentation\tests\559668.php?FORUM[LIB]=Shell`, indicating that the attacker can control the path of the included file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP code from a remote server on the vulnerable system by manipulating the `FORUM[LIB]` parameter. This can lead to complete compromise of the server, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands, steal data, or install malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `559668.php` file. The malicious URL must include the parameter `FORUM[LIB]` set to the location of the attacker's malicious file

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server and the ability to send HTTP requests.
- **Malicious server:** The attacker needs a publicly accessible server hosting a malicious PHP file.
- **Knowledge of vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable file `559668.php` and the vulnerable parameter `FORUM[LIB]`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The `PhpDocumentor` directory, where the vulnerable file resides, is often protected by an `.htaccess` file. However, the vulnerability was likely introduced by the Sitellite developer, as noted in one of the security mailing list messages.
- The exploit example from Exploit-DB demonstrates how to exploit this RFI vulnerability.
- The exploit-db entry also mentions a dork: "powered by Sitellite" to help in finding vulnerable websites
