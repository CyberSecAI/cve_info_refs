Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0747)

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix a security issue, various bugs, and add
enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular and freely-available Web server.

A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod\_proxy module. On sites where
a reverse proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully
crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that
request to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker
could cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a
malicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if
using a threaded Multi-Processing Module. (CVE-2007-3847)

As well, these updated packages fix the following bugs:

* the default "/etc/logrotate.d/httpd" script incorrectly invoked the kill

command, instead of using the "/sbin/service httpd restart" command. If you
configured the httpd PID to be in a location other than
"/var/run/httpd.pid", the httpd logs failed to be rotated. This has been
resolved in these updated packages.

* Set-Cookie headers with a status code of 3xx are not forwarded to

clients when the "ProxyErrorOverride" directive is enabled. These
responses are overridden at the proxy. Only the responses with status
codes of 4xx and 5xx are overridden in these updated packages.

* mod\_proxy did not correctly handle percent-encoded characters (ie %20)

when configured as a reverse proxy.

* invalid HTTP status codes could be logged if output filters returned

errors.

* the "ProxyTimeout" directive was not inherited across virtual host

definitions.

* in some cases the Content-Length header was dropped from HEAD responses.

This resulted in certain sites not working correctly with mod\_proxy, such
as www.windowsupdate.com.

This update adds the following enhancements:

* a new configuration option has been added, "ServerTokens Full-Release",

which adds the package release to the server version string, which is
returned in the "Server" response header.

* a new module has been added, mod\_version, which allows configuration

files to be written containing sections, which are evaluated only if the
version of httpd used matches a specified condition.

Users of httpd are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
resolve these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

httpd security, bug fix, and enhancement update (RHSA-2007-0747)

Original Release Date: December 6, 2007

Last Revised: June 2, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-500

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Apache HTTP Server is a free, open-source Web server available
from the
Apache Foundation.

The Apache HTTP Server's mod\_proxy module was found to contain an
issue when
configured as either a reverse proxy or a forward proxy. When
configured as a
reverse proxy, a specially crafted request sent to the Apache HTTP
Server could
cause the child process handling the request to crash. In the case of
the
Apache HTTP Server being configured as a forward proxy, the child
process could
similarly crash if a user viewed a malicious site through the proxy.
The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name
[CVE-2007-3847](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3847) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security
advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0747.html>

Please note that while no Avaya products are vulnerable to this issue
in
their default configuration, the vulnerable software module is installed
and
could potentially be configured to exploit these issues.

## 2. Avaya System Products with httpd installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 3.x, 4.x, 5.0 | Low | Upgrade to CM 5.1 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity Audix LX | IALX 2.0, 2.0 SP1 | Low | Upgrade to IALX 2.0 SP2. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 3.x, 4.0 | Low | Upgrade to MSS 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya Message Networking | MN 3.1 | Low | See recommended actions below.Â Â This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | SES 3.x, 4.0, 5.0 | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.1 or later. |
| Avaya AES | AES 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.2.1 | Low | Upgrade to AES 4.2.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable versions of
httpd, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

# Apache HTTP Server 2.2 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.2. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.2 is End-of-Life since December 2017 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before the End-of-Life. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.2 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.35-never

### low: Use-after-free when using <Limit > with an unrecognized method in .htaccess ("OptionsBleed") ([CVE-2017-9798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9798))

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Hanno BÃ¶ck for reporting this issue.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.34

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### important: Timeout detection flaw (mod\_proxy\_http) ([CVE-2010-2068](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2068))

An information disclosure flaw was found in mod\_proxy\_http in versions 2.2.9 through 2.2.15, 2.3.4-alpha and 2.3.5-alpha. Under certain timeout conditions, the server could return a response intended for another user. Only Windows, Netware and OS2 operating systems are affected. Only those configurations which trigger the use of proxy worker pools are affected. There was no vulnerability on earlier versions, as proxy pools were not yet introduced.

The simplest workaround is to globally configure;

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

CVE-2006-5752  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mod_status.c in the mod_status module in Apache HTTP Server (httpd), when ExtendedStatus is enabled and a public server-status page is used, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors involving charsets with browsers that perform "charset detection" when the content-type is not specified.  CVE-2007-1863  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mod_status.c in the mod_status module in Apache HTTP Server (httpd), when ExtendedStatus is enabled and a public server-status page is used, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors involving charsets with browsers that perform "charset detection" when the content-type is not specified. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Rajiv Aaron Manglani (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-05 04:11:42 UTC  ``` moderate: mod_status cross-site scripting CVE-2006-5752 Affects: 2.0.59, 2.0.58, 2.0.55, 2.0.54, 2.0.53, 2.0.52, 2.0.51, 2.0.50, 2.0.49, 2.0.48, 2.0.47, 2.0.46, 2.0.45, 2.0.44, 2.0.43, 2.0.42, 2.0.40, 2.0.39, 2.0.37, 2.0.36, 2.0.35 Fixed in Apache httpd 2.0.61-dev patched in apache-2.2.4-r12 or earlier   moderate: mod_cache proxy DoS CVE-2007-1863 Affects: 2.2.4, 2.2.3, 2.2.2, 2.2.0 Fixed in Apache httpd 2.2.6-dev patched in apache-2.2.4-r12 or earlier   didn't check the 2.0.x branch.    however apache-2.2.4-r12 need a patch for  moderate: mod_proxy crash CVE-2007-3847 A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy module. On sites where a reverse proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker could cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a malicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded Multi-Processing Module.  <http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_22.html>   ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-07 14:58:39 UTC  ``` there's also [bug 191603](show_bug.cgi?id=191603 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - www-servers/apache: Security-relevant updates"), and I have to admit I'm a bit lost with all this issues and versions.

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  Apache 2.0 mod_proxy has a defect in parsing dates returned by t
  This defect is a simple error in which heap memory beyond the en
  could be read if the date string has an invalid format.
  If the origin server returns maliciously-formatted dates and the
  improper date string resides at the end of a page of memory and
  next page is not mapped, the web server process could crash whil
  handling the proxy response.
  This could result in a denial of service, where other processing
  being performed by that web server process is terminated by the
  crash.

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  ****************************************************************
  * USERS AFFECTED: IBM HTTP SERVER configurations with          *
  * mod_proxy configured as a forward proxy to untrusted hosts   *
  ****************************************************************
  * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: mod_proxy might be forced to crash a    *
  * web server child process using a malicious Date header field *
  * in the response to IHS running as a proxy                    *
  ****************************************************************
  * RECOMMENDATION: Apply this fix if IHS is used as a forward   *
  * proxy to untrusted hosts.                                    *
  ****************************************************************
  When parsing the Date header returned from the origin server,
  mod_proxy could read memory beyond the end of the allocated
  buffer when the returned Date header is of an invalid format.
  If this memory was beyond the end of a range of addressable
  memory, a crash could result.
  If the memory was not beyond the end of a range of addressable
  memory, no problem would occur and mod_proxy would not be
  influenced by the contents of that memory.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  mod_proxy was updated to more carefully handle invalid dates
  from the origin server.
  .
  This fix is targeted for:
  Fix pack 6.1.0.13.
  Fix pack 6.0.2.23.
  Cumulative e-fix PK53584 for 2.0.47.1
  Cumulative e-fix PK55141 for 1.3.28.1

# USN-575-1: Apache vulnerabilities

4 February 2008

Apache vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.10](/security/notices?release=gutsy)
* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Packages

* [apache2](/security/cves?package=apache2) -

## Details

It was discovered that Apache did not sanitize the Expect header from

an HTTP request when it is reflected back in an error message, which

could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting

attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting

vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output

during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this

to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords),

within the same domain. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 6.06.

([CVE-2006-3918](/security/CVE-2006-3918))

It was discovered that when configured as a proxy server and using a

threaded MPM, Apache did not properly sanitize its input. A remote

attacker could send Apache crafted date headers and cause a denial of

service via application crash. By default, mod\_proxy is disabled in

Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-3847](/security/CVE-2007-3847))

It was discovered that mod\_autoindex did not force a character set,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site

scripting attacks when processing the output. ([CVE-2007-4465](/security/CVE-2007-4465))

It was discovered that mod\_imap/mod\_imagemap did not force a

character set, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable

to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. By

default, mod\_imap/mod\_imagemap is disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-5000](/security/CVE-2007-5000))

It was discovered that mod\_status when status pages were available,

allowed for cross-site scripting attacks. By default, mod\_status is

disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-6388](/security/CVE-2007-6388))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_balancer did not sanitize its input,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site

scripting attacks when processing the output. By default,

mod\_proxy\_balancer is disabled in Ubuntu. This was only vulnerable

in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-6421](/security/CVE-2007-6421))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_balancer could be made to

dereference a NULL pointer. A remote attacker could send a crafted

request and cause a denial of service via application crash. By

default, mod\_proxy\_balancer is disabled in Ubuntu. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-6422](/security/CVE-2007-6422))

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ftp did not force a character set,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site

scripting attacks when processing the output. By default,

mod\_proxy\_ftp is disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2008-0005](/security/CVE-2008-0005))

A new matching mod_ssl package is also provided.  More details about the issues may be found in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database:    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6388   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5000   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3847   Here are the details from the Slackware 11.0 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/apache-1.3.41-i486-1_slack11.0.tgz:   Upgraded to apache-1.3.41, the last regular release of the   Apache 1.3.x series, and a security bugfix-only release.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Apache: Multiple vulnerabilities â GLSA **200711-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache, possibly resulting
in a Denial of Service or the disclosure of sensitive information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.6** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.0.59-r5**>= **2.2.6** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

### Description

Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
mod\_status and mod\_autoindex (CVE-2006-5752, CVE-2007-4465). An error
has been discovered in the recall\_headers() function in mod\_mem\_cache
(CVE-2007-1862). The mod\_cache module does not properly sanitize
requests before processing them (CVE-2007-1863). The Prefork module
does not properly check PID values before sending signals
(CVE-2007-3304). The mod\_proxy module does not correctly check headers
before processing them (CVE-2007-3847).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit one of these vulnerabilities to inject
arbitrary script or HTML content, obtain sensitive information or cause
a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.59-r5"
```

We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.0 has had no new releases since 2013 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before August 2013. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.0 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.65

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Brett Gervasoni of Sense of Security for reporting and proposing a patch fix for this issue.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### moderate: HTTP Request Spoofing ([CVE-2005-2088](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2005-2088))

A flaw occured when using the Apache server as a HTTP proxy. A remote attacker could send a HTTP request with both a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header and a Content-Length header, causing Apache to incorrectly handle and forward the body of the request in a way that causes the receiving server to process it as a separate HTTP request. This could allow the bypass of web application firewall protection or lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### moderate: CGI scripts source revealed using WebDAV ([CVE-2002-1156](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1156))

In Apache 2.0.42 only, for a location where both WebDAV and CGI were enabled, a POST request to a CGI script would reveal the CGI source to a remote user.

| Update 2.0.43 released | 2002-10-03 |
| --- | --- |
| Affects | 2.0.42 |

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.42

### moderate: mod\_dav crash ([CVE-2002-1593](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-1593))

A flaw was found in handling of versioning hooks in mod\_dav. An attacker could send a carefully crafted request in such a way to cause the child process handling the connection to crash. This issue will only result in a denial of service where a threaded process model is in use.

| Issue public | 2002-09-19 |
| --- | --- |
| Update 2.0.42 released | 2002-09-24 |
| Affects | 2.0.40, 2.0.39, 2.0.37, 2.0.36, 2.0.35 |

### low: Path revealing exposures ([CVE-2002-0654](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2002-0654))

A path-revealing exposure was present in multiview type map negotiation (such as the default error documents) where a module would report the full path of the typemapped .var file when multiple documents or no documents could be served. Additionally a path-revealing exposure in cgi/cgid when Apache fails to invoke a script. The modules would report "couldn't create child process /path-to-script/script.pl" revealing the full path of the script.

> We have found the support from Red Hat to be exemplary. Whenever we need anything from them, they have given it â¦ Red Hat is now our backbone. Our business cannot run if Red Hat is not there.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
