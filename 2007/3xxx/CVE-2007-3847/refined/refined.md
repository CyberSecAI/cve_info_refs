{
  "Root cause": "A flaw exists in the Apache HTTP Server's mod_proxy module that could cause a crash when handling specific requests",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper input sanitization",
    "Out-of-bounds read"
    
  ],
  "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the Apache child process.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending a specially crafted request to a reverse proxy.",
    "Persuading a user to visit a malicious website using a forward proxy."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to send crafted requests or have a user visit a malicious site using a proxy",
   "Additional Information": "This vulnerability is present in both reverse and forward proxy configurations of mod_proxy, leading to a potential denial of service if using a threaded Multi-Processing Module. This is due to a flaw in how the date headers are processed."
