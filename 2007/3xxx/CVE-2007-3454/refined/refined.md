Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in the Trend Micro OfficeScan security patch:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the Trend Micro OfficeScan server CGI modules.
*   **Improper Authentication:** The OfficeScan Management Console login password authentication can be bypassed by sending crafted HTTP headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** This is a classic memory corruption vulnerability that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The ability to bypass login authentication mechanisms completely undermines the security of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the web user running the OfficeScan server. This could lead to complete compromise of the server.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the OfficeScan Management Console without valid credentials, allowing them to modify settings, disable security features, and potentially launch further attacks on managed endpoints.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CGI Module Exploitation:** The buffer overflow vulnerability is present in the CGI modules of the OfficeScan server, suggesting that this is the point of exploitation. This likely involves sending specially crafted requests to the vulnerable module.
*   **Crafted HTTP Headers:** The authentication bypass is achieved by sending crafted HTTP headers to the OfficeScan server. This implies a weakness in how the server processes or validates the headers during the login process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to the Trend Micro OfficeScan server.
*   **HTTP Request Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests, specifically crafted ones, to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker would require knowledge of the specific vulnerabilities in order to craft their exploit requests.

**Additional Details**

* The security patch updates the CGIOCommon.dll and cgiChkMasterPwd.exe modules to address the vulnerabilities.
* The patch prevents the authentication bypass by resetting the stored decrypted user logon information
*  The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it outlines the exact nature of the vulnerabilities and how the patch resolves them.
