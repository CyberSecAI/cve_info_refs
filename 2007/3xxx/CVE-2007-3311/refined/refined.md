Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `print.php` file of the Articles module for XOOPS. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is directly used in a SQL query without adequate validation.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code through the `id` parameter.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The provided exploit indicates the vulnerability is exploitable even without direct feedback from the server. The attacker can use techniques to infer data based on server responses.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *  **Data Leakage:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information, including usernames and password hashes, from the `xoops_users` table.
    *  **Potential for Further Compromise:** Depending on database privileges, the attacker could modify data, escalate privileges, or potentially gain control of the server.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `print.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.
    *   **URL Manipulation:**  The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL to inject SQL code, e.g. `http://localhost/script/modules/articles/print.php?id=3/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,uid,uname,pass,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL/**/FROM/**/xoops_users/**/LIMIT/**/1,1/*`

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable XOOPS installation.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any authentication.
    *   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic understanding of HTTP requests and SQL injection techniques.

**Summary of Technical Details**

The provided exploit code in Perl confirms the SQL injection by utilizing a `UNION SELECT` to extract password hashes from the `xoops_users` table.  It performs blind SQL injection by iterating over different user IDs. The exploit works by injecting malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter to retrieve password hashes.

The content provides more detail than the standard CVE description by providing specific details on exploitation via the provided perl script, and describing the blind sql injection attack.
