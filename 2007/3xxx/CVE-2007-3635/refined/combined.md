# [VIM] SquirrelMail GPG Plugin Vulnerabilities

I'm trying to make sense of the spate of recent vulnerabilities
associated with the GPG Plugin for SquirrelMail.

o There's the WabiSabiLabi advisory (ZD-00000004) that sparked the
interest. It supposedly affects version 2.0 of the plugin, is remotely
exploitable, and allows for command execution.

o The author released version 2.1 of the plugin on 7/7 and says it
"contains security fixes to prevent possible command injection attacks
by local authenticated users against the webserver user." I don't find
any reference in the release or on the author's site to the WabiSabiLabi
advisory per se, and the CVS commit log for the software, at
<<http://www.braverock.com/gpg/statcvs/commit_log.html>>, shows only a
single change in 2007, made on 7/7, for a local file include issue in
the 'gpg_pop_init.php' script as noted by Stefan Esser. [A quick check
shows that it involves the 'MOD' parameter and can be exploited remotely
without authentication.]

o <http://lists.immunitysec.com/pipermail/dailydave/2007-July/004448.html>
is a post made by Charlie Miller on 7/6 to Daily Dave in which he
suggests the issue underlying ZD-00000004 might involve $passphrase in
gpg_sign_attachment() although he has not actually verified it.

o <http://lists.immunitysec.com/pipermail/dailydave/2007-July/004452.html>
is a post made Nicob on 7/8 to Daily Dave that mentions an attack vector
fixed in version 2.1 but provides no specifics.

o <http://lists.immunitysec.com/pipermail/dailydave/2007-July/004453.html>
is a post from Stefan Esser on 7/9 to Daily Dave that asserts there are
several more shell command execution flaws in version 2.1 that the
vendor is aware of. Unfortunately, he provides no specifics.

o <http://lists.immunitysec.com/pipermail/dailydave/2007-July/004456.html>
is a post made by Nicob on 7/9 to Daily Dave that details an attack
vector involving the gpg_check_sign_pgp_mime() function in
gpg_hook_functions.php.

So, how are you VDB folks sorting all this out? I've noticed so far that
Bugtraq 24782 maps to WabiSabiLabi's advisory (although oddly it claims
the issue has now been resolved with version 2.1 of the plugin) and
24828 to Esser's posting.

Am I getting all this straight?

George
