Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2007-3142:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the handling of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) in the Opera web browser. Specifically, the issue is related to how Opera displays URIs, including how it handles whitespaces within the URI and how it renders long HTTP server names in dialog boxes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **URI Display Issue:** The vulnerability is described as a "minor error," related to how Opera displays URIs.  The primary issue is that URIs containing whitespace or very long HTTP server names are not correctly displayed, potentially misleading users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Deception:** An attacker could craft a malicious URI, using either whitespaces or an overly long server name, which may mislead the user about the actual destination or origin of the link. This could lead a user to visit a malicious website, assuming it was a legitimate website. This is primarily a phishing attack vector that relies on the user not recognizing the deception.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URI:** An attacker could create a malicious link containing a long server name or whitespaces, and send it to the user. If the user clicks on this link, it is not correctly displayed and they might be fooled into trusting it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send or present the crafted URI to the victim. This could be done through email, instant messaging, or by placing the crafted URI on a website that a victim may visit. The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.
