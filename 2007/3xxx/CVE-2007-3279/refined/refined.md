Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described, which are related to PostgreSQL but not specific to a single CVE, and do not match CVE-2007-3279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Default Trust Authentication:** The default PostgreSQL configuration allows local connections without password authentication, which enables local users to connect as any PostgreSQL user, including the superuser. This is due to the `trust` setting in `pg_hba.conf`.
*   **`dblink` Library Misuse:** The `dblink` library, designed for inter-database connections, can be abused to escalate privileges when combined with local trust authentication. It allows execution of queries in the context of a different user, including superusers, on the same server.
*   **Unrestricted Function Mapping (Prior to PostgreSQL 8.2):**  Prior to version 8.2, PostgreSQL allowed users to map functions from arbitrary libraries (like libc) into database functions. This allowed execution of system commands and file system access via mapped functions.
*   **PL/pgSQL Function Creation:** The ability for PUBLIC users to create functions in PL/pgSQL by default allows the creation of malicious functions (brute forcing passwords)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Local users can gain superuser privileges by using `dblink` to connect to the local database with superuser credentials when trust authentication is enabled.
*   **Password Brute-Forcing:** The ability to create functions in PL/pgSQL allows for the implementation of brute-force password attempts against PostgreSQL users, potentially leveraging a remote database for wordlists.
*   **Remote Port Scanning:** The `dblink` library can be used to perform port scanning on a remote host. Connection errors expose details about the network and target server, which can be used to identify open ports and services.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution (Prior to PostgreSQL 8.2):** Mapping functions from `libc` allows execution of arbitrary code on the server via the `system()` function, as well as arbitrary file access via `open`, `write` and `close`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Database Control:** Privilege escalation grants complete control over the database, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data and gain access to sensitive information like password hashes.
*   **Data Breach:** Access to database content can lead to sensitive data breaches.
*   **Denial of Service:** System resource abuse can lead to DoS.
*   **Remote Server Compromise (Prior to PostgreSQL 8.2):** Arbitrary code execution enables attackers to compromise the host server where PostgreSQL is running, potentially establishing a shell.
*   **File System Access (Prior to PostgreSQL 8.2):** Ability to read and write to the file system.
*   **Network Reconnaissance:** Port scanning can reveal network vulnerabilities and provide information to launch further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** Exploiting the local trust authentication to gain initial access.
*   **SQL Injection:** Leveraging SQL injection vulnerabilities to execute malicious queries.
*   **Database User Account:** Exploiting compromised database user accounts to execute malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the database server if trust authentication is enabled.
*   **SQL Injection Vulnerability:** An attacker can leverage SQL injection to perform the attacks remotely.
*   **Database User Account (For some brute-force attacks):** The attacker requires valid database user accounts to attempt brute-force attacks.
*   **Superuser Account or privilege escalation (prior to 8.2):** Exploiting functionality that required superuser privilege would require the attacker to compromise a superuser account or escalate to this privilege through other means.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document emphasizes that these are issues with configuration and older versions of PostgreSQL and not issues with the libraries themselves.
*   The attacks using direct function mapping are not possible in versions of PostgreSQL after 8.2 due to compatibility checks.
*   The document introduces pgshell, a Perl script designed to automate the described attack vectors, further illustrating the potential for exploitation.
