## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

# Ruby on Rails: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-17**

Several vulnerabilities were found in Ruby on Rails allowing for file
disclosure and theft of user credentials.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-ruby/rails** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.5** |

### Background

Ruby on Rails is a free web framework used to develop database-driven
web applications.

### Description

candlerb found that ActiveResource, when processing responses using the
Hash.from\_xml() function, does not properly sanitize filenames
(CVE-2007-5380). The session management functionality allowed the
"session\_id" to be set in the URL (CVE-2007-5380). BCC discovered that
the to\_json() function does not properly sanitize input before
returning it to the user (CVE-2007-3227).

### Impact

Unauthenticated remote attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to
determine the existence of files or to read the contents of arbitrary
XML files; conduct session fixation attacks and gain unauthorized
access; and to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's
browser session in context of an affected site by enticing a user to
browse a specially crafted URL.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Ruby on Rails users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-ruby/rails-1.2.5"
```

| [Description](#c0)  Rajiv Aaron Manglani (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-10 01:45:13 UTC  ``` Security Enhancements  1.2.4 fixes several potential security issues:      * Session fixation attacks are mitigated by removing support for URL-based sessions     * Changed the JSON encoding algorithms to avoid otential XSS issues when using ActiveRecord::Base#to_json     * Potential Security and performance problems with XmlSimple have been fixed by disabling certain dangerous options by default.  -------------------------------  From: 	  michael@koziarski.com Subject: 	Ruby on Rails 1.2.4 Date: 	October 9, 2007 9:33:45 PM EDT To: 	  rubyonrails-security@googlegroups.com Reply-To: 	  rubyonrails-security@googlegroups.com   The release of Ruby on Rails 1.2.4 addresses some potential security issues, all users of earlier versions are advised to upgrade to 1.2.4:  The particular issues are:  # Potential Information Disclosure or DoS with Hash#from_xml  Maliciously crafted requests to a rails application could cause the XML parser to read files from the server's disk or the network.  1.2.4 removes this functionality entirely.  # Session Fixation attacks.  The session functionality in rails allowed users to provide their session_id in the URL as well as cookies.  The functionality could be exploited by a malicious user to obtain an authenticated session.  Users who rely on URL based sessions can re-enable them as follows:  config.action_controller.session_options[:session_secure] = true  --  Cheers  Koz ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Hans de Graaff   gentoo-dev Security  2007-10-10 05:37:02 UTC  ``` The JSON problem, although not mentioned in the security announcement, is being addressed in [bug #182223](show_bug.cgi?id=182223 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-ruby/activesupport <= 1.4.2 \"to_json\" Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2007-3227)"). Rails 1.2.4 is already in the tree and if no regressions are found we'll ask for it to become stable this weekend. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Hans de Graaff   gentoo-dev Security  2007-10-11 05:47:25 UTC  ``` So it seems that Rails 1.2.5 is forthcoming shortly to address the problem with JSON encoding once more. I propose we wait until Rails 1.2.5 is out and stabilize that once it is in the tree. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Rajiv Aaron Manglani (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-12 16:56:29 UTC  ``` <http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/10/12/rails-1-2-5-maintenance-release>   From: DHH <david.heinemeier@gmail.com> To: "Ruby on Rails: Security" <rubyonrails-security@googlegroups.com> Date: Fri, 12 Oct 2007 16:50:53 -0000 Subject: Rails 1.2.5: Closes JSON XSS vulnerability Reply-To: rubyonrails-security@googlegroups.com   This release closes a JSON XSS vulnerability, fixes a couple of minor regressions introduced in 1.2.4, and backports a handful of features and fixes from the 2.0 preview release.  All users of Rails 1.2.4 or earlier are advised to upgrade to 1.2.5, though it isn't strictly necessary if you aren't working with JSON. For more information the JSON vulnerability, see CVE-2007-3227.   ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Hans de Graaff   gentoo-dev Security  2007-10-13 06:38:43 UTC  ``` Rails 1.2.5 and friends just got added to CVS. Since upstream in all its wisdom decided to also include a few features that are backported from the forthcoming 2.0 branch, I'd like to test this a bit more before we start to stable it. Let's aim for a call to stable this on Monday. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-15 23:52:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=195315#c4)) > ... I'd like to test this a bit more before we start to stable it. > Let's aim for a call to stable this on Monday.  Did you experience any regressions, is it ok to go? ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Hans de Graaff   gentoo-dev Security  2007-10-16 05:32:40 UTC  ``` We should be good to go. No reports of any issues and I've also not noticed any regressions or problems in my own tests.   Arches, please stabilize dev-ruby/rails-1.2.5 and its dependencies. Both Rails 1.2.4 and 1.2.5 contain security fixes compared to Rails 1.2.3-r1. The following packages need to be stabilized in this order to avoid dependency issues:  eselect-rails-0.10 (already stable on arches that have marked rails 1.2.3-r1 as stable) activesupport-1.4.4 activerecord-1.15.5 actionpack-1.13.5 actionmailer-1.3.5 actionwebservice-1.2.5 rails-1.2.5  Note that this bug supersedes [bug #177209](show_bug.cgi?id=177209 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - stabilize dev-ruby/rails-1.2.3-r1"), calling for the stabilization of rails-1.2.3-r1 ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-16 06:01:32 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 177209](show_bug.cgi?id=177209 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - stabilize dev-ruby/rails-1.2.3-r1") *** ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-16 06:13:16 UTC  ``` Of course it should be the other way round ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-16 06:13:33 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 177209](show_bug.cgi?id=177209 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - stabilize dev-ruby/rails-1.2.3-r1") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Hans de Graaff   gentoo-dev Security  2007-10-16 06:57:35 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 182223](show_bug.cgi?id=182223 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-ruby/activesupport <= 1.4.2 \"to_json\" Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2007-3227)") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Christian Faulhammer (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-16 07:16:56 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Raúl Porcel (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-16 13:31:01 UTC  ``` ia64/sparc stable ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Tobias Scherbaum (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-18 17:16:21 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Steve Dibb (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-21 15:24:36 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-21 15:42:34 UTC  ``` Proposing B3. Please vote!  Together with [bug #182223](show_bug.cgi?id=182223 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-ruby/activesupport <= 1.4.2 \"to_json\" Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2007-3227)"), we have these these issues:  CVE-2007-5380:          Session fixation vulnerability in Rails before 1.2.4, as used for Ruby          on Rails, allows remote attackers to hijack web sessions via          unspecified vectors related to "URL-based sessions." CVE-2007-5379:          Rails before 1.2.4, as used for Ruby on Rails, allows remote attackers          and ActiveResource servers to determine the existence of arbitrary          files and read arbitrary XML files via the Hash.from_xml          (Hash#from_xml) method, which uses XmlSimple (XML::Simple) unsafely,          as demonstrated by reading passwords from the Pidgin (Gaim)          .purple/accounts.xml file. CVE-2007-3227:          Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the to_json function in          Ruby on Rails before edge 9606 allows remote attackers to inject          arbitrary web script via the input values.  ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-21 17:48:04 UTC  ``` I tend to vote YES. ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Raphael Marichez (Falco) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-25 20:11:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=195315#c15)) > CVE-2007-5380: >          Session fixation vulnerability   perhaps...   > CVE-2007-5379: >          files and read arbitrary XML files via the Hash.from_xml >          (Hash#from_xml) method, which uses XmlSimple (XML::Simple) unsafely, >          as demonstrated by reading passwords from the Pidgin (Gaim)  mmm   > CVE-2007-3227: >          Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the to_json function in  non-persistent XSS, i would vote no for this CVE.    Globally i vote nothing, sorry...  ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  Robert Buchholz (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-10-25 23:21:02 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=195315#c15)) >      ... read arbitrary XML files via the Hash.from_xml >          (Hash#from_xml) method, which uses XmlSimple (XML::Simple) unsafely, >          as demonstrated by reading passwords from the Pidgin (Gaim) >          .purple/accounts.xml file.  I would vote yes for this issue. XML might not be the dominant way to save configurations and passwords, but I would not call it uncommon, so reading those files could be quite a breach for users. ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-07 08:25:03 UTC  ``` voting yes too, glsa request filed. ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-11-14 21:23:23 UTC  ``` GLSA 200711-17 ``` |  |
