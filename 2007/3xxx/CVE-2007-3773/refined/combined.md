Advisory #2 |
=============
-> "Generic YouTube Clone Script - XSRF: Arbitrary Code Injection" <-
\_\_\_\_\_\_
Data |
======
Author: Pepepistola <Pepepistola\_at\_chxsecurity\_dot\_org>
Program: Generic YouTube Clone Script
Severity: Moderately Critical
Type of Advisory: Mid Disclosure
Affected/Tested Versions: -- (\* See below)
\* There multiple clone scripts make by multiple vendors but all share the
same mistakes
and even same code, so we couldnt determinate the right (or original)
vendor.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Program Description |
====================
Dream to build your own highly profitable online video sharing community
just like YouTube or DailyMotion?
Unleash the power of video sharing to boost your websites' traffic &
revenues!
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Overview |
=========
The "Email-Template" module has no file type validation and a remote
attacker could lead the admin
to create a especially crafted malicious email template that allows the
remote attacker to compromise
the entire system.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
WorkAround |
===========
The Admin has the capabilities to create and a "Email-Template" that would
be stored in the directory:
/templates/emails/
Since the module doesn't have any file type validation the admin can upload
any arbitrary file type,
so a remote attacker can gain access by just leading the (already logged-in)
admin to and a specially
crafted (malicious) website that truth a Cross-site Request Forgery make the
admin automatically create
a email template.
This could lead to a remote attacker to gain access and further more
compromise the entire system.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Proof Of Concept|
================
ChX Security will not release any proof of concept.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Solution/Fix|
============
By the moment there is no official solution provided by the vendor(s)...
ChX Security encourages to the website admins to just stay logged-in only
the necessary time and keep
logged-off at all time that you dont have to do any administration related
task.
