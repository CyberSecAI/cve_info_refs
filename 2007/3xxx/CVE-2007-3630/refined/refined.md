Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `changePW.php` script of AV Tutorial 1.0. The script allows a user to change the password of any user by manipulating the `userid` parameter in the URL. The script incorrectly uses the `userid` parameter to identify the user whose password needs to be changed. The `oldpassword` variable is also taken from the URL, which isn't checked against the actual password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The `userid` parameter in the URL directly controls which user's password is being modified. There is no proper authorization or validation to prevent a user from changing another user's password.
- **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The script does not verify the identity of the user making the password change request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Password Change:** An attacker can change the password of any user, including administrators, by exploiting this vulnerability, which can result in complete account compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP POST request to `changePW.php`, modifying the `userid` parameter to the target user's ID and supplying a new password in the request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know or guess the target user's ID, but the user's old password is not needed.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
