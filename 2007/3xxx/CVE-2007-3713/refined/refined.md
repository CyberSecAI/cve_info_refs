```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Insufficient bounds-testing in centericq, a text-mode multi-protocol instant messenger client.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Buffer overflow.
- Impact of exploitation: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code.
- Attack vectors: Remote.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to send malicious input that triggers the buffer overflow via network.
