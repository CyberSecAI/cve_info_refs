  "related_cves": [
    "CVE-2007-3997"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the usage of MySQL's LOCAL INFILE feature which allows loading data from files on the server into a table. This can bypass PHP's safe_mode restrictions when handling MySQL and MySQLi extensions.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "PHP's MySQL and MySQLi extensions do not properly restrict the usage of MySQL's LOCAL INFILE feature, which can be exploited to bypass safe_mode restrictions."
  ],
  "impact": "This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass PHP's safe\_mode restrictions, potentially leading to unauthorized file access and information disclosure on shared hosting systems.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "The attack vector is local, by exploiting the LOCAL INFILE option through MySQL or MySQLi database connections from within PHP scripts."
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute PHP code on the server, which may be possible through shared hosting accounts or other avenues of code injection."
