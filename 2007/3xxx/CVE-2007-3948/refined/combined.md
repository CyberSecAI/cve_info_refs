How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Lighttpd: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200708-11**

Several vulnerabilities were reported in Lighttpd, most of them allowing a
Denial of Service and potentially the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/lighttpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.16** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.16** |

### Background

Lighttpd is a lightweight HTTP web server.

### Description

Stefan Esser discovered errors with evidence of memory corruption in
the code parsing the headers. Several independent researchers also
reported errors involving the handling of HTTP headers, the mod\_auth
and mod\_scgi modules, and the limitation of active connections.

### Impact

A remote attacker can trigger any of these vulnerabilities by sending
malicious data to the server, which may lead to a crash or memory
exhaustion, and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.
Additionally, access-deny settings can be evaded by appending a final /
to a URL.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Lighttpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/lighttpd-1.4.16"
```

Package        : lighttpd
Vulnerability  : various
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-0983 CVE-2007-3948
Debian Bug     : 434888 466663

Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd,
a fast webserver with minimal memory footprint.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2008-0983
  lighttpd 1.4.18, and possibly other versions before 1.5.0, does not
  properly calculate the size of a file descriptor array, which allows
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large number
  of connections, which triggers an out-of-bounds access.

CVE-2007-3948
  connections.c in lighttpd before 1.4.16 might accept more connections
  than the configured maximum, which allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (failed assertion) via a large number of connection
  attempts.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.13-4etch9.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.18-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### lighty 1.4.13 crashes with accessing out of bound fd array index

Added by Anonymous [over 17 years](/projects/lighttpd/activity?from=2007-06-04 "2007-06-04 04:30") ago.

**Description**

When server.max-fds was set lower than system/process limits in lighttpd.conf it allocates that number of file descriptors to process evenets with various back-ends type.
However if lighty get larger number of fds under high system load it will access the array without checking whether the index is valid or not. That results in segfault or voluntary abort() in fdevent\_get\_context().

It can be easily demonstrated with lower fd value, say "server.max-fds = 100", while maintaining large number of active connections. Sometimes lighty records "accept failed: Too many open files" in error log and ignore the excessive file descriptor but it's not enough as lightty tries to accept connections upto 100 in network\_server\_handle\_fdevent().

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.
