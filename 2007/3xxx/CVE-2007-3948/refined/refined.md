  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to insufficient connection limits in lighttpd.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The server accepts more connections than the configured maximum.",
      "Out-of-bounds access due to incorrect file descriptor array size calculation."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) via a large number of connection attempts, potentially leading to a crash or failed assertion.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a large number of connection attempts to the server."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable server."
  },
  "additional_details": {
        "vulnerability_details": "The 'connections.c' file in Lighttpd before version 1.4.16 has a flaw where it might accept more connections than the configured maximum, leading to a denial-of-service. A separate issue exists where the file descriptor array size isn't correctly calculated leading to out-of-bounds access. This occurs when the number of active connections exceeds the server's intended limit, causing a crash or assertion failure.",
      "affected_software": "lighttpd versions prior to 1.4.16",
