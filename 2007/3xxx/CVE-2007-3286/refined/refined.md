- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the COM objects installed by Avaya IP Softphone. These COM objects interface with Internet Explorer (IE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflows in the IP Softphone COM objects.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain administrative access on the vulnerable system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited if a user with IP Softphone installed visits a malicious intranet website. The malicious website can trigger the buffer overflows within the vulnerable COM objects through Internet Explorer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website on a local intranet that is accessible to a user with the vulnerable software. The user needs to visit the malicious site using a vulnerable browser configuration (IE 6 SP2 or earlier with low security settings for the local intranet or where "Initialize and script ActiveX controls not marked as safe" is not disabled). The COM objects must not be marked as "safe for scripting".
