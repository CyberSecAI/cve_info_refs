Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in IP Softphone

Original Release Date: September 11, 2007

Last Revised: September 11, 2007

Number: ASA-2007-314

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Avaya IP Softphone installs various Windows Component Object Model (COM) objects
that interface with Internet Explorer (IE). Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities in
the COM objects installed with IP Softphone have recently been reported to Avaya.

If a user with IP Softphone installed on their system visited a malicious intranet Web site,
the malicious site could exploit one of the vulnerable routines in the IP Softphone COM Objects and
obtain administrative access on the vulnerable system. This vulnerability can only be
exploited by a Web site located within a local intranet,
as the COM objects installed by IP Softphone are not marked as "safe for scripting".
Systems with IP Softphone installed are vulnerable if they have IE 6 SP2 or earlier, and
IE security settings for "Local intranet" are set to Low or the security setting "Initialize and
script ActiveX controls not marked as safe" is not Disabled.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project name for this issue is
[CVE-2007-3286](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3286).

Avaya would like to thank Kurt Grutzmacher for reporting these issues.

## 2. Avaya System Products with Buffer Overflow Issues:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya IP Softphone | R5.2 and R6.0, including Service Packs and Video Integrator | Low | Install R5.2 Service Pack 3 supplied on support.avaya.com. The next service pack for R6.0 will also contain the fix for this issue (fall 2007). To mitigate these issues, Avaya recommends setting the Security Level in IE for the "Local intranet" zone to be at least Medium to prevent potentially dangerous ActiveX controls from executing. IP Softphone users can also upgrade to IE 7, which has protection against such attacks. |
