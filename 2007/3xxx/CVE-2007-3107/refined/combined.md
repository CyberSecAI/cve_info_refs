How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

The minix filesystem did not properly validate certain filesystem

values. If a local attacker could trick the system into attempting

to mount a corrupted minix filesystem, the kernel could be made to

hang for long periods of time, resulting in a denial of service.

This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2006-6058](/security/CVE-2006-6058))

The signal handling on PowerPC systems using HTX allowed local users

to cause a denial of service via floating point corruption. This was

only vulnerable in Ubuntu 6.10 and 7.04. ([CVE-2007-3107](/security/CVE-2007-3107))

The Linux kernel did not properly validate the hop-by-hop IPv6

extended header. Remote attackers could send a crafted IPv6 packet

and cause a denial of service via kernel panic. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-4567](/security/CVE-2007-4567))

The JFFS2 filesystem with ACL support enabled did not properly store

permissions during inode creation and ACL setting. Local users could

possibly access restricted files after a remount. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-4849](/security/CVE-2007-4849))

Chris Evans discovered an issue with certain drivers that use the

ieee80211\_rx function. Remote attackers could send a crafted 802.11

frame and cause a denial of service via crash. This was only

vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-4997](/security/CVE-2007-4997))

Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam

devices. A local user with physical access to the system could remove

the device while a userspace application had it open and cause the USB

subsystem to block. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04.

([CVE-2007-5093](/security/CVE-2007-5093))

Scott James Remnant discovered a coding error in ptrace. Local users

could exploit this and cause the kernel to enter an infinite loop.

This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.04 and 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5500](/security/CVE-2007-5500))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel could dereference a NULL

pointer when processing certain IPv4 TCP packets. A remote attacker

could send a crafted TCP ACK response and cause a denial of service

via crash. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 7.10. ([CVE-2007-5501](/security/CVE-2007-5501))

Warren Togami discovered that the hrtimer subsystem did not properly

check for large relative timeouts. A local user could exploit this and

cause a denial of service via soft lockup. ([CVE-2007-5966](/security/CVE-2007-5966))

Venustech AD-LAB discovered a buffer overflow in the isdn net

subsystem. This issue is exploitable by local users via crafted input

to the isdn\_ioctl function. ([CVE-2007-6063](/security/CVE-2007-6063))

It was discovered that the isdn subsystem did not properly check for

NULL termination when performing ioctl handling. A local user could

exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-6151](/security/CVE-2007-6151))

Blake Frantz discovered that when a root process overwrote an existing

core file, the resulting core file retained the previous core file's

ownership. Local users could exploit this to gain access to sensitive

information. ([CVE-2007-6206](/security/CVE-2007-6206))

Hugh Dickins discovered the when using the tmpfs filesystem, under

rare circumstances, a kernel page may be improperly cleared. A local

user may be able to exploit this and read sensitive kernel data or

cause a denial of service via crash. ([CVE-2007-6417](/security/CVE-2007-6417))

Bill Roman discovered that the VFS subsystem did not properly check

access modes. A local user may be able to gain removal privileges on

directories. ([CVE-2008-0001](/security/CVE-2008-0001))

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=245580#c0)  Ludek Smid    2007-06-25 15:13:15 UTC  ``` This bug has been copied from [bug #245332](show_bug.cgi?id=245332) and has been proposed to be backported to 5.0 z-stream (EUS).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=245580#c3)  Martin Jenner    2007-07-05 19:13:20 UTC  ``` Konrad,  Any update on the status of IBM testing on with the 2.6.18-8.1.8.el5 kernel ?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=245580#c4)  Konrad Rzeszutek    2007-07-05 20:07:59 UTC  ``` Testing of 2.6.18-8.1.8.el5 passed the  HTX test-suite successfully.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=245580#c7)  Marcel Holtmann    2007-07-10 03:35:34 UTC  ``` We think that we are getting a page fault or timer interrupt during one of the __copy_from_user calls in restore_sigcontext - the ones that write to current->thread.fpr and current->thread.vr.  Since we aren't clearing MSR_FP and MSR_VEC until after the copy, switching to another process during the copy will overwrite current->thread.fpr (assuming the signal handler used floating-point instructions).  If we clear those MSR bits before copying into current->thread.fpr and/or current->thread.vr, like the 32-bit code already does, we are safe -- and that's what we will do with this patch. The bad news is that this bug was introduced in 2.6.2, so it is present in RHEL4, SLES9 and SLES10 as well...    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=245580#c8)  Red Hat Bugzilla    2007-07-10 04:04:28 UTC  ```  An advisory has been issued which should help the problem described in this bug report. This report is therefore being closed with a resolution of ERRATA. For more information on the solution and/or where to find the updated files, please follow the link below.
