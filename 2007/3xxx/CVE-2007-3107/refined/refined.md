  "cve": "CVE-2007-3107",
  "source_text": "The signal handling on PowerPC systems using HTX allowed local users to cause a denial of service via floating point corruption. This was only vulnerable in Ubuntu 6.10 and 7.04.",
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper signal handling on PowerPC systems when using HTX, specifically during the restore_sigcontext function where MSR_FP and MSR_VEC bits were not being cleared before copying to current->thread.fpr and current->thread.vr, which can lead to data corruption if the process gets switched during the copy operation.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Improper signal handling",
    "Data corruption due to race condition"
  ],
  "impact": "Local users can cause a denial of service via floating point corruption.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Local access to a vulnerable system"
