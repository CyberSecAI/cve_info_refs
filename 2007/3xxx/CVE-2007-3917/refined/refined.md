{
  "CVE-2007-3917": {
    "Description": "A malicious user could send a long chat message with multibyte characters. The server would truncate the message on a fixed length, without paying attention to the multibyte characters. This led to invalid utf-8 on the client and an uncaught exception was thrown. Note both wesnoth and the wesnoth server are affected.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of multibyte characters during chat message truncation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow due to fixed-length truncation of UTF-8 strings.",
      "Lack of proper UTF-8 handling leading to invalid characters.",
      "Uncaught exception on the client side when receiving invalid UTF-8."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service due to client crashes caused by invalid UTF-8 input.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a long chat message with multibyte characters to a vulnerable server.",
      "Exploitation via network communication with a vulnerable client or server."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to send chat messages to a vulnerable Wesnoth server.",
      "Knowledge of how to craft a message to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
    "Additional Information": [
      "The vulnerability was present in older versions of Wesnoth, including 0.9.x.",
      "The issue affects both the client and server components.",
      "The vulnerability was fixed in Wesnoth versions 1.2.7 and later.",
      "A similar issue was also present in the 1.3 development branch, which was fixed in version 1.3.9."
