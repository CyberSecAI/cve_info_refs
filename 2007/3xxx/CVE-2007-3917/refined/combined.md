How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This led to invalid utf-8 on the client and an uncaught exception was thrown. Note both wesnoth and the wesnoth server are affected.  Additional information:  I am aware of no further details, nor the fix.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=324841#c1)  Fedora Update System    2007-10-11 01:46:56 UTC  ``` wesnoth-1.2.7-1.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 testing repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.  If you want to test the update, you can install it with   su -c 'yum --enablerepo=updates-testing update wesnoth'   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=324841#c2)  Fedora Update System    2007-10-11 22:55:04 UTC  ``` wesnoth-1.2.7-1.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

Package        : wesnoth
Vulnerability  : progrmaming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-3917

A problem has been discovered in the processing of chat messages.
Overly long messages are truncated by the server to a fixed length,
without paying attention to the multibyte characters.  This leads to
invalid UTF-8 on clients and causes an uncaught exception.  Note that
both wesnoth and the wesnoth server are affected.

For the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.0-6 and in version 1.2.7-1~bpo31+1 of sarge-backports.

For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2-2 and in version 1.2.7-1~bpo40+1 of etch-backports.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.7-1.

Packages for the oldstable mips architecture will be added to the
archive later.

We recommend that you upgrade your wesnoth packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Wesnoth 1.2.7 is out!

This is a bugfix release for 1.2 and it is compatible with the other 1.2 versions. The main reason for this release was an important fix where an utf8 char at the wrong position in a chatmessage could crash other clients. This bug was filled as CVE-2007-3917. Since this is a rather serious issue, it was fixed in this release. Please update as soon as possible to the new version. Most problems could already be fixed by an update to the server but it is still critical if you are running your own server or direct games not via the official servers. This bug is a really old one, it did even exist in 0.9.x (relevant for all the old debian stable users, a fix will be applied in there, too) but should now be completely fixed.

Beside this important change only small things were changed. Some maps and translations were updated and the font needed for the japanese translation was added to the release tarball and should from now on be included in all binaries, too. For all the other changes (really not much), have a look at the [changelog](http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/wesnoth/tags/1.2.7/changelog?rev=20982&view=download).

Downloads:

[http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnot ... 2?download](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/wesnoth-1.2.7.tar.bz2?download) (69.7MB) [md5sum](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/wesnoth-1.2.7.tar.bz2.md5?download)

The xdelta is available already, but keep in mind that it is rather big due to the new font:

[http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnot ... a?download](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/wesnoth-1.2.6.tar-wesnoth-1.2.7.tar.xdelta?download) (5.3MB)

Check <http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7034> for info on using xdelta.

The MacOSX binary is ready, keep in mind that OSX 10.3+ is required:

[http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnot ... g?download](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/Wesnoth_MacOSX_1.2.7.dmg?download) (full version, 80.8MB)

[http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnot ... g?download](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/Wesnoth_MacOSX_1.2.7_lite.dmg?download) (lite version (no artwork and music), 51.5MB)

The Windows binary is not available yet.

Beside this you can already find the Gentoo and the Debian binaries at the usual places (aka in your package manager once you updated it).

As a fallback you can also get the sources from <http://files.wesnoth.org/> - you should first try to get files through SourceForge to help us save bandwidth.

server.wesnoth.org is ready to be used for multiplayer games.

If you have any problems, follow the instructions given in [this](http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14531) thread before reporting it as a bug. Instructions for bug reporting can be found at <http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/ReportingBugs>

The OpenSUSE, ArkLinux, OpenBSD, Syllable and OpenSolaris packagers have been notified. These are all in my list of packagers to be notified, I hope their packages are ready soon.

Enjoy!

[OpenBSD package](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#OpenBSD) ready! Currently only @ my server (uploading it to SF now).

**Note:** you need OpenBSD -current branch (especially for xenocara -- libX11 version 11) to install this package.

p.s. uploaded to SF.

**Wesnoth 1.3.9 is out!**

So this is 1.3.9. Since I am feeling very lazy today I will keep this thingie short. Here is what the other devs told me that I would have to mention in the announcement:

The campaign "An Orcish Incursion" has been heavily revised and added to mainline. We hope you will enjoy playing this campaign. Feedback is welcome.

The multiplayer DoS attacks have been fixed, both in server and client. Those are the same problems that were the reason for the release of 1.2.7 and there should be no more problems with users being able to crash other users clients.

The algorithm for rebuilding the map after its terrain changes has been optimized, and so the editor and some WML events might work faster now. Please test if it really is faster, speedup should be at least a factor of 10 on slow machines, in some cases even a factor of 100 though you will mainly notice it when using the editor, those situations are rather rare in the game itself. No idea if you will feel any change on faster machines, getting some feedback would be nice.

What else was changed? Some updated graphics, translations and probably a lot more that I am too lazy to mention now. For a more complete list (not 100% complete, some devs tend to forget adding entries) have a look at the [changelog](http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/wesnoth/tags/1.3.9/changelog?rev=21008&view=download). A changelog with the changes that might be visible to most users (and only includes these) is the [players\_changelog](http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/wesnoth/tags/1.3.9/players_changelog?rev=21008&view=download).

**Downloads**

Sources:

[http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wesn ... 2?download](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/wesnoth-1.3.9.tar.bz2?download) (93.6MB) [md5sum](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/wesnoth-1.3.9.tar.bz2.md5?download)

Here is the xDelta for the sources:

[http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnot ... a?download](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wesnoth/wesnoth-1.3.8.tar-wesnoth-1.3.9.tar.xdelta?download) (1.3.8 to 1.3.9, 9.6MB)

Check <http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7034> for info on using xdelta.

The Windows binary is ready and available at the [download page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Development_.281.3_branch.29).

The Mac OSX binary is ready and available at the [download page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Development_.281.3_branch.29).

The OpenSolaris binary is not available yet. Once it is you can find it on the [download page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Development_.281.3_branch.29).

The Debian binary is already on its way into experimental though it might take some more days until it is accepted. No idea which other binaries are ready, but all the known packagers have been contacted. Infos about where to get the respective binaries or how to get them work you get on the [Linux binaries site](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/WesnothBinariesLinux) for the Linux binaries. Download links for the other supported systems will be listed at the [downloads page](http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Download#Development_.281.3_branch.29) once the binaries are available.

As a fallback you can also get the sources from <http://files.wesnoth.org/> - you should first try to get files through SourceForge to help us save bandwidth.

Soon we will shutdown the 1.3.8 multiplayer server because we want to focus on getting 1.3.9 tested. No idea if the game itself would be compatible with 1.3.8 but to be honest: I don't care too much and you should assume that it is not. The server for 1.3.9 is already up and waiting for you to play on it. So consider doing an update as soon as possible. We want to wait with this until the MacOSX and the Windows binary are ready but once they are out we will shut down the old server.

If you find any bugs don't hesitate to report them after reading the instructions about how to post them. Instructions for bug reporting can be found at <http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/ReportingBugs>.

Enjoy!

EDIT: Added the MacOSX binary.

EDIT 2: Added the Windows binary.

Liking the change to "Crossroads". The old approach was just annoying...

Compiled source under Ubuntu Gutsy (7.10) the other day. Compilation works fine, however the tests fails. Are the tests up to date and working or can I just ignore it? The game seems to work fine.

Used the suggested

Code: Select all

```
./configure --datadir=/usr/share/games ... (with ... = /wesnoth-source)
make
sudo make install

```

from <http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/WesnothBinariesLinux>

Maybe that is why the test cant find the files?

For anybody wanting to also compile it on their own you will need the following extra packages:

libsdl1.2-dev

libsdl-image1.2-dev

libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

libsdl-net1.2-dev

libfreetype6-dev

plus basic compilation tools (already compiled ALSA .15 on the fresh Gutsy install so dont know exactly what specific packages you would also need on a completely fresh Gutsy)

BTW Just saw that these are listed on

<http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/CompilingWesnoth>

but not in the compile advices for debian/ubuntu on the binary page.

Maybe some cleaning and moving around on the wiki would be in order ![:)](./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif "Smile")

I compiled and played under Mandriva 2007 without problems.

One, simple and little annoying thing its a strange sound that sometimes appears: just started your turn and you ear the Bell sound repetead until the end of your turn.

This doesn't happen always, seems to me to happen random.
Don't bother a dwarf.. you can argue with his hammer!
