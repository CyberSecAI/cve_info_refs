      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user input in the `lang` parameter of the `login.php` script, allowing for file inclusion and subsequent remote code execution.",

          "Remote Code Execution",
          "File Inclusion"
        ],
         "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by injecting malicious PHP code into the log files using HTTP GET requests, and then including the file with a vulnerable `login.php` script. This allows complete control of the system.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "HTTP GET requests",
           "File inclusion",
          "Log Poisoning"

        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server, knowing the path of the affected application. The attacker also needs to guess the path of the server's log files."
