```
  - **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `WriteMovie` method in `Avaxswf.dll` does not properly validate if it is being called by a legitimate application or a malicious user.
  - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary data write vulnerability due to insecure file handling in the `WriteMovie` method.
  - **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can write arbitrary data to any file on the vulnerable system, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, system compromise or denial of service.
  - **Attack vectors:** Remote exploitation via a malicious webpage that includes the vulnerable ActiveX control.
  - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to get a victim to visit a webpage with malicious code targeting the vulnerable ActiveX control. No authentication is needed.
