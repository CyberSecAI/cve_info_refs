How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : debian-goodies
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitising
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: yes
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-3912
Debian Bug     : 440411

Thomas de Grenier de Latour discovered that the checkrestart tool in the
debian-goodies suite of utilities, allowed local users to gain privileges
via shell metacharacters in the name of the executable file for a running
process.

For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.27+etch1.

For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.23+sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.34.

We recommend that you upgrade your debian-goodies package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Subject: checkrestart: arbitrary root-privileged command execution
Date: Sat, 1 Sep 2007 12:42:19 +0200
```
Package: debian-goodies
Version: 0.33
Severity: grave
Tags: security

Hi,

The checkrestart program from debian-goodies (both latest 0.33 and
stable 0.27) allows arbitrary command execution with root privileges.

Example:

 $ cp /bin/sleep "; OWNED"
 $ ./"; OWNED" 1000 &
 $ rm "; OWNED"
 $ sudo checkrestart
 ...
 sh: OWNED: command not found
 ...

Since this program is likely launched as a daily root cron job on some
systems, I think this is a grave security hole.

The cause of the problem is the way "dpkg --search" is spawned
from the main() function:

    ...
    dpkgQuery = 'dpkg --search ' + ' '.join(programs.keys())
    for line in os.popen(dpkgQuery).readlines():
        ...

In my above example, one of the programs.keys() is "; OWNED", and thus
the executed command is "dpkg --search ... ; OWNED ...".

Fixing this should be as easy as:

 ...
 import subprocess
 ...
    dpkgQuery = ["dpkg", "--search"] + programs.keys()
    dpkgProc = subprocess.Popen(dpkgQuery, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    for line in dpkgProc.stdout.readlines():
        ...

This way, the command arguments are all well separated, without any
shell interpretation.

PS: sorry for any mistake i may have done in the way i've reported this
bug.  I'm not a Debian user, so i'm not used to your system.  Actually,
i just happened to come accross this "checkrestart" script reading a
gentoo-dev@ post:

Thanks. I was not aware of this bug.

Actually, it should not be executed as a daily cron job, but should be run
manually by an admin.

Thanks, I will test out the patch and fix this as soon as possible.
