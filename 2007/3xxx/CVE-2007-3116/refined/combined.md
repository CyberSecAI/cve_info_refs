How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### [Yes, open source is a win-win](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/09/yes-open-source-is-win-win.html)

Open source is a win-win.

I am very pleased to let the MaraDNS community know that I have successfully gotten a job offer which I just accepted this week. This is a job offer which I would not have gotten if I had not kept my skills current while living in Mexico by continuing to develop MaraDNS, culminating with a three-year-long complete rewrite of the recursive code.

The timing for getting this offer is perfect. As I [planned to do a year ago](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2009/10/every-open-source-developer-grows-up.html), now that MaraDNS 2.0 is out the door, I will put MaraDNS on the back burner. This will give me more time to be a productive worker at my new job and refine my programming knowledge to master new technologies, keeping my skills current in the 2010s.

I am going to continue to support MaraDNS, of course. I will fix important bugs brought up on the mailing list, and will naturally fix any critical security bug that may be found in MaraDNS. I will also answer emails on the mailing list when and if I have time to do so. But, I do not have any plans to add new features to MaraDNS at this time.

I would like to thank all MaraDNS users for all of your comments, feedback, bug reports, and feature requests. I have devoted a lot of the last decade to MaraDNS, and it has been an honor to freely give to the world something which I hope people find useful.

Open source development truly pays off. It’s a win for users, since they have good code which they can change any way they see fit; it’s a win for developers, because it allows them to showcase their work and demonstrate their programming discipline to prospective employers. I encourage people who are looking to improve their programming skills to become part of an open-source project. It can be frustrating at times; but it is also rewarding.

### [MaraDNS 2.0.01 released](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/09/maradns-2001-released.html)

I have released MaraDNS 2.0.01. This is simply MaraDNS 1.4 with the deprecated MaraDNS 1.x recursive DNS server removed, and with the documentation updated to reflect the fact that Deadwood 3 is now used for MaraDNS’ recursion. People, of course, are free to use MaraDNS 1.4 for as long as they want, but its recursive code is now deprecated and only supported for critical security updates.

I encourage users of MaraDNS to use Deadwood for all recursion with MaraDNS.

### [Deadwood 3.0.01 released](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/09/deadwood-3001-released.html)

I have released Deadwood 3.0.01 today. With this release made, no new features will be added to the Deadwood recursive resolver for the foreseeable future. However, bug fixes and other routine maintenance will still be applied to this software package.

Deadwood is now a stable recursive resolver suitable for embedded systems, desktop PCs, or on internet servers. Deadwood is fully 64-bit compatible, has optional support for IPv6, and does not require threads to resolve records.

Deadwood 3.0.01 will be the recursive resolver for MaraDNS 2.0, which I will release shortly, as well as being an optional recursive DNS server to use in MaraDNS 1.4.

It has been a pleasure developing Deadwood and MaraDNS for nearly a decade. I will continue to support MaraDNS and Deadwood but have no plans to add new features once MaraDNS 2.0 is released.

In addition, I no longer need to accept donations for MaraDNS. All Deadwood and MaraDNS support needs to be done via the MaraDNS mailing list.

The 3.0.01 release of Deadwood is available here:

### [MaraDNS progress report: Documentation updates](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/08/maradns-progress-report-documentation.html)

I am continuing to update MaraDNS 2.0’s up and-coming documentation to correctly reflect the fact that all recursion is now done by the separate daemon Deadwood. I have also updated Deadwood’s manpage to state that Deadwood is a fully recursive DNS server.

### [New MaraDNS 1.9 snapshot](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/08/new-maradns-19-snapshot.html)

I made some progress with updating the documentation for MaraDNS 2.0; I have updated the mararc man page to remove parameters that are used for MaraDNS 1’s recursion, as well as adding a section in the update document on updating from MaraDNS 1.4 to MaraDNS 2.0.

I plan on adding a couple of details from the Deadwood FAQ to MaraDNS’s upgrade document, as well as updating MaraDNS’ tutorials to discuss using Deadwood for all recursion.

I am considering MaraDNS 1.9.x releases “snapshot” releases since I am making them fairly quickly right now.

They can be looked at here:

### [MaraDNS 1.9: Moving towards MaraDNS 2.0](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/08/maradns-19-moving-towards-maradns-20.html)

I have made the changes to MaraDNS’ codebase to prepare her for the MaraDNS 2.0 release. The changes are (drum roll) pretty simple, actually: I have gone through all of the #ifdef AUTHONLY statements to either keep them as AUTHONLY statements, or to change them to #ifdef IPV6 for statements which enable IPv6 support (MaraDNS 1 has no recursive IPv6 support, so AUTHONLY is also used to enable IPv6).

The only other change I have done is to revise the build scripts to:

* Always define AUTHONLY when compiling MaraDNS* Update the configure script and Makefiles to allow one to enable or disable IPv6* Not link MaraDNS to the pthreads library (MaraDNS 2.0 will be thread-free)* Compile Deadwood as MaraDNS 2.0’s recursive resolver* I removed makefiles for all operating systems besides Linux, Windows, and a generic \*NIX “noflock” makefile

It can be looked at here:

<http://maradns.org/download/1.9/>

At this point, the code for both MaraDNS 2.0 and Deadwood 3.0 (the recursive resolver MaraDNS will have) are done: The only changes will be bug fixes. The thing I should do at this point is revise MaraDNS’ documentation to reflect the MaraDNS 2.0 changes, as well as removing any MaraDNS 1 SQA tests that test MaraDNS’ recursor.

One issue MaraDNS 2.0 will have is that the recursive resolver will require a separate IP, and that there isn’t an automated way to convert a MaraDNS 1 mararc file in to a MaraDNS 2 mararc file and Deadwood 3 dwood3rc file. This in mind, I have no plans to stop supporting MaraDNS 1.4 for critical security fixes and other important bugfixes and updates (such as updating the default list of root nameservers) for the foreseeable future, as well as supporting MaraDNS 2.0 for “this host does not resolve” bugs, as well as other bug fixes.

### [Deadwood update: No news is good news](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/08/deadwood-update-no-news-is-good-news.html)

No news is good news.

And, there’s no news for Deadwood this week. The only updates since 2.9.05 released a week ago today are documentation updates. I haven’t seen a single site not resolve in Deadwood that can resolve with other DNS servers.

I encourage users to continue testing Deadwood and reporting bugs on [the MaraDNS mailing list](http://maradns.org/faq.html#subscribe).

### [Where is the money?](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/08/where-is-money.html)

**This job market is scary**

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I just wake up and I can’t sleep anymore. I wonder if I am going to be able to re-enter the technology field or if I’m just going to end up teaching ESL for the rest of my life.

**How MaraDNS came in to being**

About a decade ago, everything was right. I had a well-paying promising contract with a major software company. I was making far more money than I knew what to do with. The work environment was fun and there was no limit with where I could take my career.

I was miserable.

It didn’t help that the girl I was dating at the time was not working out. When I finally let her go—she still owes me $312.98 for the record—I could not for love or money get a decent date. Having to commute for an hour followed by working eight hours followed by another hour coming back home five times a week doesn’t leave me much time to be part of the singles scene.

*Something had to change.*

The last job I had in technology before the dot-com bubble popped was for an internationalization firm. I met a lot of people from a lot of countries speaking a lot of languages. This revived my long-dormant interest in learning Spanish. Once that company died when the dot-com party ended, I went down to Mexico for a few months to learn Spanish.

It was a life-changing experience. I instantly went from being a guy who couldn’t get a decent date to save my life to someone who had this beautiful girl in my bed passionately making out with me. While things sadly didn’t work out with her, I discovered a world where I was no longer isolated and miserable. I had found home.

Of course, I wasn’t going to put my technical skills to waste. No, I wanted to make a name for myself and MaraDNS was already well underway when I was still working in the dot-com industry. It ignited my passion because here was something that wasn’t going to get forgotten when the company I worked for got bought out two times. It was my chance to make my mark on the world.

And, indeed, it has. You do a Google search of my name and MaraDNS is the third link that pops up. [It has a Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaraDNS). Indeed, MaraDNS is notable enough that the entry can not be easily deleted by the kinds of Wikipedia editors hell-bent on removing anything they can from the Wikipedia [1], because it has been used by a number of people and mentioned in books, in the title of a ZDnet article, as well as a number of scholarly papers.

After over a year of hard work, I released MaraDNS 1.0 on June 21, 2002. Then I went back to college and put MaraDNS on the back burner. Sure, I fixed bugs, but with all of my studies, and with adjusting to living in a far more conservative town than where I lived before (something I never fully adjusted to, quite frankly), I put MaraDNS on the back burner, sometimes going as long as half a year without updating it. Even back then, I wanted to rewrite MaraDNS’ recursive code, but just didn’t have time to do it.

As things were winding down with college and I was getting accustomed to life in that town, I was able to devote some time to improving the authoritative half of MaraDNS, including adding non-recursive IPv6 support to MaraDNS and improving its zone file format. This culminated with MaraDNS 1.2 being released in late 2005, a few months after I graduated from college. I then made some minor revisions to the zone file format to make it possible to write a Python script to convert BIND zone files in to MaraDNS zone files; that resulted in the 1.3 release a year after 1.2 was released.

It was between the 1.2 and 1.3 releases that I decided it was more important to go back to Mexico to improve my personal relationships than to try and get a job in the computer industry again. I had two notable rejections because I didn’t know more about C++ and objected-oriented programming, from both Google and a startup in southern California, and ended up briefly working as a cashier in Wal\*Mart before throwing in the towel and going back to Mexico.

While dating girls down in Mexico, not only did I get a Python script to convert BIND zone files to MaraDNS zone files done, I finally started work on rewriting the recursive engine, something I had wanted to do for years. I started writing Deadwood in late 2007, with me planning to have a standalone recursive DNS daemon finished in mid-2008.

That didn’t happen. I had the fully non-recursive cache finished by late 2007, but then realized I had to concentrate more strongly on dating to have the right girl in my life in 2008.

It was while dating in 2008 that I started realizing the needs to put boundaries on MaraDNS support and start looking in to getting compensated for my hard work. Private email support was getting backlogged, so I finally had to let people know I would not support MaraDNS via private email without being paid for my time. People who appreciated MaraDNS started paying me a little in the tip jar I set up or by paying me a token sum for me to implement a feature they wanted in MaraDNS.

I had lost a lot of my free-software ideals at this point. I believed in 2000 that the year of the Linux desktop would happen. In 2004, I got off my high horse and started dual-booting in to Windows. In 2008, I got rid of my Linux partition altogether and started using Windows with Cygwin and a VMware virtual machine for the occasional Deadwood development I did that year. As I started developing Deadwood again, I tried putting Linux on my computer and [liked it so little](http://maradns.blogspot.com/search/label/Linux%20sucks) that I stabilized on the current setup I have for Deadwood development: Windows XP as my primary desktop OS, along with a CentOS 5 virtual machine which I use to develop Deadwood.

While this was going on, I found the girl who is today my wife in late 2008, and then had both a setup in place and some more free time to devote to working on Deadwood in 2009.

After getting most of the underlying support for having a fully recursive nameserver done (DNS compression support, integrated DNS-over-TCP support, full mararc dictionary variable and “execfile” support, “ip\_blacklist” support, inflight merging, etc.), things with my girlfriend got serious and she became my fiancée. With marriage looming on the horizon, I grew up and realized [it was time to make a roadmap to put closure on MaraDNS](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2009/10/every-open-source-developer-grows-up.html).

I was, when I made that decision, close enough to having Deadwood be fully recursive that I made Deadwood’s full recursion the point when I would declare MaraDNS done. I started work on Deadwood again in early 2010, and finally had full recursion finished in late July of 2010.

So, yeah, MaraDNS is finished. This doesn’t mean I am never going to make another release of MaraDNS. MaraDNS 2.0 is simply going to be MaraDNS 1.4 with the old recursive code thrown out, replaced by Deadwood being integrated in to the build script.

I will also update the documentation telling people how to update from MaraDNS to Deadwood. This will have to be done by hand; in order to ease the transition, I will support both MaraDNS 1.4 and 2.0 with security and other critical bug fixes for the foreseeable future. I also have no plans to stop fixing “this host does not resolve with Deadwood” bugs.

In addition, I am getting some minor sponsorship for MaraDNS, and will consider implementing features my sponsors want to implement. The only other thing I *might* do is add some more extensive SQA tests to test for bugs in fully recursive Deadwood (I currently only have one that tests one kind of recursive query).

**Back to reality**

So, yes, MaraDNS is finished. Time to get back to reality. I have been spending the last couple of weeks, along with fixing bugs in Deadwood, learning about a lot of new technologies. I have a mid-1990s book on Object Oriented programming I have almost finished (inheritance, both single and multiple, abstract classes, throwing and catching exceptions, a bit on C++ templates).

I had a phone screen for, of all things, a Javascript position yesterday. The position didn’t pan out: Even after spending all last weekend madly studying and learning Javascript, and explaining it is hardly the first scripting language I played with, my technical knowledge was not up to par with what they were looking for.

A good friend of mine told me last night I need to get more focused to get something in today’s job market. Since I have *decades* of C programming experience, and well over 60,000 lines of C code to show potential employers (MaraDNS), it makes the most sense to expand this with C++. There is the argument that it may make more sense for me to instead concentrate on Objective C, but the issue there is that I’m not a user of Apple’s products and don’t see too much money selling 99 cent iPhone toy applications.

I feel, if I improve my C++ programming, I will be able to get a good job, possibly with Google. Back during the dot-com days, I went to a lot of Linux User Group meetings where I met such people as Paul Vixie, Larry Wall, Linus Torvalds, RMS, as well as getting on a first-name basis with [Chris DiBona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_DiBona). I think I will shoot Chris an email and see what ideas he has for me getting a stable corporate job.

I also have, bouncing around my head, a couple of ideas of how I can use the MaraDNS code to make a commercial product. I’m not sure how to develop the ideas and make a product from them, but I have already sent out a couple of emails to people who may have an idea how to start a business with them.

I’ve grown up. The 2000s were a good decade, since not only did I become fluent in the Spanish language and make my mark on the world with MaraDNS, an excellent high-security tiny embedded DNS server, I also found the woman who today is my wife.

There are some things I regret. I feel I spent too much time in the 2000s editing the Wikipedia, posting to Slashdot, making chess variants, or playing video games by myself; time I could have spent mastering C++ and being in a better position to get a job in the tech sector today. Indeed, I have a strict “no posts to Slashdot, no edits to the Wikipedia, and no chess variants” rule I made for myself so I can focus on the things I need to do to be a good husband for my wife.

So, yeah, even though everything seems scary right now and I wake up with these anxiety attacks when I bomb a phone screening like what happened yesterday, I know there is a good job out there for me for the 2010s that will support my wife and myself. I just have to keep trying, not give up, and not get upset every time I try and fail.

[1] A classic example of the internet dork rule. I find it rather fitting that [the twit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%3ATheserialcomma) who [tried to delete the MaraDNS article](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MaraDNS&action=historysubmit&diff=319098865&oldid=319084383) is not only completely anonymous (unlike [my Wikipedia account](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User%3ASamboy) [which I haven’t used since March](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special%3AContributions/Samboy)), but also is someone who [has been blocked for rude Wikipedia behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User%3ATheserialcomma), [something that hasn’t happen to me](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User%3ASamboy) [2].

[2] Truth in reporting compels me to point out I once had a 24-hour block for violating something called the “three revert rule” back in 2005, when I thought it was worth wasting my time arguing with the kinds of people who like to pretend their kitchen is their own empire that they are the grand emperor for. Oh, how I wish I had spent the time I wasted arguing on the Wikipedia (and, yeah, /.) learning C++ or Java.

### [MaraDNS 1.4.04 released](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/07/maradns-1404-released.html)

Now that Deadwood is feature-complete, I have released MaraDNS 1.4.04. This is the most current stable release of MaraDNS; if using an older MaraDNS, please update to this release (yes, I ran a bunch of SQA tests so anything that worked before should work in 1.4.04).

While the old recursive code is still in place to allow people to slowly make the transition to using Deadwood as their recursive DNS server, Deadwood 2.9.02 is included. The Windows version of MaraDNS has had its documentation updated to encourage people to use Deadwood for recursion instead of MaraDNS; I will also start nudging \*NIX users along.

I have also, [as blogged about yesterday](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/07/deadwood-and-maradns-now-have-windows.html), made a tool for getting entropy from the OS and putting it in a file. This is currently a very simple tool; it makes a random 64-byte file called secret.txt which MaraDNS and Deadwood can use. It acts like a UNIX command: There is no user interface; when it is run, it just silently creates the 64-byte random secret.txt file, overwriting any already existing secret.txt, and only outputting something if something goes wrong.

It’s a lot better than the old “just type in some random text to make secret.txt” directions I have given. I plan on making it a little more friendly (failing if secret.txt already exists, and stating the secret.txt file has been created, and always pausing and having the user hit a key so they know what the program is doing if called from the GUI.)

In addition, I fixed the bug with delegation NS records and ANY queries, as well as incorporating a NAPTR bugfix I made a few months ago in to the code. [There is a full changelog](http://maradns.org/changelog.html).

It can be looked at here:

### [Deadwood and MaraDNS now have a Windows tool for making secret.txt](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/07/deadwood-and-maradns-now-have-windows.html)

Deadwood and MaraDNS now both have a tool for getting entropy (random numbers) so that the file secret.txt is automatically generated. I call the tool "mkSecretTxt", and its source code can be looked at here:

<http://samiam.org/software/mkSecretTxt.txt>

Or downloaded as a C source file here:

<http://samiam.org/software/mkSecretTxt.c>

The file is a Windows port of the following \*NIX command:

dd if=/dev/urandom of=secret.txt bs=64 count=1

In English: My program creates a 512-bit (64-byte) file called “secret.txt” using CryptGenRandom() to acquire the entropy from the Windows operating system.

This tool will make it easier for people to install and use MaraDNS and Deadwood in Windows, since they only have to run this program once to get some entropy for the servers’ random number generators.

### [Deadwood 2.9.02 released ; keep on testing guys](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/07/deadwood-2902-released-keep-on-testing.html)

I have released Deadwood 2.9.02 today. This is Deadwood 2.9.01 with bugfixes and documentation improvements. In more detail, here are the changes since 2.9.01:

* Script to apply patches against one version of Deadwood to make the next Deadwood release made (based on similar MaraDNS script; this is something I have implemented now that the code is feature-complete and ready for general testing)* INSTALL.txt updated to not mention DwMain (Deadwood's older name; issue reported [on mailing list](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000610.html))* DW\_MAXIPS increased to 128 (issue reported [on mailing list](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000615.html))* Spurious debug message removed* Documentation updates (root\_servers more fully described in man page; more questions and answers added to FAQ; fixes things I saw myself and reported on mailing list)* Bug reporting policy update (you better have a stack trace or be able to reproduce a crash; otherwise I can’t use the bug report. No current issue; but I have had stuff like this with MaraDNS. Any joker can pretend Deadwood is crashing, but I won’t believe you without proof)* Issue getting “SERVER FAIL” when AAAA query points to non-existent AAAA fixed. (Reported [on mailing list](http://marc.info/?l=maradns-list&m=128014555425838&w=2))* Issue when we get a “a.kabah.foo CNAME b.kabah.foo ; c.kabah.foo A 10.2.3.4” packet (where “b.kabah.foo” is a CNAME for “c.kabah.foo”) fixed. (Found this one during my own “dogfood” testing of Deadwood)* Deadwood for Windows now built using MinGW 3.4.2 instead of MinGW 3.1.0 (issue found by myself and discussed [on mailing list](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000601.html))

It can be downloaded here:

<http://maradns.org/deadwood/testing/>

As an aside, now that I’m visibly actively working with users again so we can find and fix bugs together, I have been getting a lot more private email asking for MaraDNS support. I don’t mind this email (I’ve come to accept it’s a natural consequence of MaraDNS becoming popular), but you’re going to get the “pay me or take it to the list” form reply (I’ve come to accept people will occasionally get all worked up I don’t provide free support; I forward such lusers [1] on to the list, like I warn people I may do in my form reply, for our collective amusement).

I hope some of the people sending me this kind of email pay me for MaraDNS support; I can use the money. Or better yet, get me a real job with a living wage. Now that MaraDNS 2.0’s recursive resolver is feature-complete, I hope to have time to master OOP, Java, and whatever other buzzwords I need on my resume to get the job to support my beautiful wife.

[1] Someone who doesn’t read the “no free private email support” disclaimer at the bottom of the [MaraDNS web page](http://maradns.org/), as well as [on the webpage with my email address](http://samiam.org/mailme.php), not to mention [at](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000627.html) [the](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000625.html) [bottom](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000624.html) [most](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000622.html) [postings](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000619.html) [I](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000607.html) [make](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000606.html) [to](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000604.html) [the](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000602.html) [mailing](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000618.html) [list](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/2010-July/000611.html), and then flames me in response to my form reply asking for money [2] gets a LART in the form of me going public with their email. Especially since the form reply says, very clearly at the top, that I may forward their email to the MaraDNS mailing list.

[2] It doesn’t just ask for money. It also lets them know they can get free support by posting it to the MaraDNS list.

### [Upstream replies to Debian bugs](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/07/upstream-replies-to-debian-bugs.html)

Since a number of MaraDNS users use the Debian bug tracking system to report MaraDNS bugs, I have just gone through a number of old Debian bugs. The ones with distribution-specific issues I have ignored, but here are my replies to issues I, as upstream, are responsible for:

[Bug 477787](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=477787): MaraDNS 2.0 will have full IPv6 support. I have just made a beta-test release of the relevant code (MaraDNS 2.0's up-and-coming recursor, Deadwood) and encourage people to test it and report bugs on the MaraDNS mailing list.

[Bug 484466](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=484466): If MaraDNS is run using the duende daemonizer, sending MaraDNS a HUP signal will stop and restart MaraDNS, reloading all configuration and zone files.

[Bug 486497](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=486497): It's a really bad idea to bind MaraDNS to 0.0.0.0, but if you insist on doing it, it can be done if csv2\_synthip\_list is set.

[Bug 507591](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=507591): This issue was never present in MaraDNS 1.2, and has been fixed in MaraDNS 1.3.07.10 and MaraDNS 1.4.03. If Debian versions of MaraDNS still have this bug, they need to incorporate my fix, or, better yet, upgrade to 1.3.07.10 or 1.4.03.

[Bug 525188](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=525188): Just this last day, I have released Deadwood 2.9.01, which is the daemon that will become MaraDNS 2.0's recursive resolver. This daemon fixes a number of long-standing issues MaraDNS 1.0's recursive resolver has, including CNAMEs pointing to AAAA records.

This particular issue is one that I will not fix in MaraDNS 1.x (IPv6 does not have wide adoption yet, and MaraDNS 2.0 should be out there by the time it does), but it has already been fixed for MaraDNS 2.0.

[Bug 573970](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=573970): There are no plans to add this to the authoritative MaraDNS code, but the up-and-coming MaraDNS 2.0 release will use a separate daemon for recursion called Deadwood (I just released the first beta-test version of this daemon this last day), which does support "includes" via Python-compatible execfile("filename") syntax.

[All other bugs](http://bugs.debian.org/maradns) appear to be Debian-specific OS issues. The next time I look at Debian bugs will probably be in a year or two.

### [Deadwood 2.9.01 released: Full recursion](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/07/deadwood-2901-released-full-recursion.html)

I have just released Deadwood 2.9.01. This is the first release of the fully recursive Deadwood; Deadwood no longer needs an upstream server performing the “heavy lifting” of recursive DNS.

I have done a lot of “web surfing” testing with Deadwood; I have fixed enough bugs that Deadwood can be used for casual web surfing. Indeed, I am using Deadwood to post this blog right now and the issues I saw before ([tagged.com](http://tagged.com), etc.) are no longer a problem.

This is a testing release. That now has a different meaning than my previous definition of a testing release. All of the features Deadwood 3.0 (MaraDNS 2.0) will have are already implemented. At this point, the program needs testing (expansion of the SQA regressions to handle recursion, etc.) and documentation (root\_servers hasn’t been documented yet) updates.

It has been a long road to get here. I have wanted to rewrite MaraDNS’ recursive resolver since 2002; I started writing Deadwood in 2007 and it’s finally feature-complete here in 2010.

Deadwood 2.9.01 can be downloaded as source code and Windows binaries here:

[maradns.org/deadwood/testing/](http://maradns.org/deadwood/testing/)

I encourage people to test Deadwood and make bug reports. Some things to keep in mind:

* Valgrind-reported memory leaks can always be reported. Valgrind-reported errors are only valid if Deadwood is compiled with -DVALGRIND\_NOERRORS* The only officially supported OSes are Windows XP and CentOS 5. OS-specific issues such as startup, daemonizing, sysloggin, and /etc/resolv.conf setup are only supported on these two OSes.* Bugs need to be reported to the MaraDNS list, not to my email account nor as blog comments. I hope to have time to set up a web forum for MaraDNS/Deadwood support for people not comfortable with mailing lists, but no promises.

### [I am getting sponsorship for MaraDNS](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/07/i-am-getting-sponsorship-for-maradns.html)

I am letting people know that I am now getting regular sponsorship for MaraDNS. This means that, as long as the sponsorship continues, I will, [contrary to the roadmap I placed in this blog entry](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2009/10/every-open-source-developer-grows-up.html), add new features to MaraDNS (as [I said when I clarified my MaraDNS roadmap](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2009/10/clarification-about-maradns-roadmap.html)).

That’s the good news.

The bad news for the freetards is that the features I will add will be the features my sponsor wants me to add. They are not the features you want to add to MaraDNS—unless you’re willing to also sponsor MaraDNS.

### [Deadwood update: I have found some bugs](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/07/deadwood-update-i-have-found-some-bugs.html)

Just letting you all know that I have, from a single day of casual web surfing, found a number of host names that don’t resolve correctly with Deadwood 2.6.04. I will be working on fixing those this week.

There is no need to send me bug reports about Deadwood 2.6.04. I am already aware of its bugs.

I should probably note that Deadwood has much more solid code that MaraDNS 1.0’s recursive resolver did at this point back in 2001; the bugs I’m seeing are SERVER FAILs and hostnames resolving incorrectly. The bugs MaraDNS 1.0 had during this phase of development (good enough to start using on the real internet for recursive resolution) caused crashes.

### [Deadwood 2.6.04 released: CNAME support](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/07/deadwood-2604-released-incomplete-cname.html)

I’m almost at the finish line.

Deadwood is almost feature-complete for the (hopefully very soon) up-and-coming 2.0 release of MaraDNS.

This morning, I wrapped up support for resolving incomplete CNAME entries. The only thing I have to do at this point is have Deadwood do the right thing for ANY records, then the testing cycle begins.

In plain English, this means Deadwood is ready for people who do not need to run an email server with it (email servers need to do a lot of ANY queries); it is OK to test it by browsing the web with it.

As I was doing the regression tests for the release (a series of tests I run before any release to make sure nothing breaks between releases), I discovered that one of my tests, which works fine in CentOS 5.3 and 5.4, no longer works in CentOS 5.5. This is an issue with the OS, not Deadwood. If I have time and feel charitable, I will isolate the bug and make a bug report. I still run this test in CentOS 5.3 when I do Deadwood’s 64-bit testing.

In addition, I had to revise the tests using Valgrind, since CentOS 5.5 has updated Valgrind to a version with slightly different output. I have set up these tests to have two successful outputs—the output in Valgrind that comes with CentOS 5.5, and the old output for when I do 64-bit testing in CentOS 5.3.

This release of Deadwood is available here:

<http://maradns.org/deadwood/testing/>

I am using its recursive resolution to write this blog entry right now. Web surfing around, the only website I have seen problems with is [tagged.com](http://tagged.com); some host name needed to load Javascript here isn’t resolving. I will look at this when I have some time.

Another known bug is that Deadwood makes unneeded multiple upstream DNS queries when resolving an incomplete CNAME record.

OK, I have a lot to do, but encourage users who aren’t running MTAs (email servers) to test out Deadwood 2.6.04 and report any bugs as comments here or on the MaraDNS mailing list. Please do not email me bug reports, unless it’s a Bugtraq-worthy security bug report.

### [On CNAME records](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/07/on-cname-records.html)

I thought handling incomplete CNAME records would be really easy once I had support for glueless NS referrals.

I was wrong.

I can understand why DJB [took some shortcuts with CNAME records in DJBdns](http://homepages.tesco.net./~J.deBoynePollard/FGA/djbdns-problems.html#dnscache-cname-handling). CNAME handling is pretty much the last thing I’m adding support for in Deadwood, MaraDNS 2.0’s recursive resolver. It’s like I have been running a 40 kilometer marathon and I’m within 50 meters of the finish line. I just want to run as fast as possible to the finish line and end the marathon.

So, yeah, I’m making some shortcuts with CNAME referrals. DJB has it so that CNAME records are not stored *at all* in the cache. Deadwood right now stores CNAME records in the cache, but only when the CNAME record is completed. For example, if I ask for up.nytimes.com, which is right now an incomplete CNAME record that points to up.about.akadns.net, Deadwood stores the completed version of up.nytimes.com with the IP for up.about.akadns.net in the entry for up.nytimes.com, but only when we get all of the information.

In addition, the CNAME records before the final answer (up.nytimes.com in the above example) have a fixed TTL of 60 seconds (which doesn’t mean anything); the final answer has a fixed TTL of 3600 seconds (one hour).

Right now, incomplete CNAME records only work if the record the incomplete CNAME points to is already in the cache. Resolving this is *hopefully* easier than getting CNAME records already in the cache working was; I think I have mostly done this when I got glueless NS referrals to work.

Another thing: If the resolution of an incomplete CNAME record is needed to handle a glueless record, the resolved record will not be used to help solve the parent query that needed the glueless record until that query is sent to Deadwood again. I may or may not fix this before releasing MaraDNS 2.0.

OK, back to finishing up incomplete CNAME referral support. I will hopefully have Deadwood 2.6.04 out in a few days.

### [Placing text ads on samiam.org or maradns.org](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/05/placing-text-ads-on-samiamorg-or.html)

Every now and then, I get someone who sends me an email wanting to participate in a "link exchange program" or to pay me a little to place a text ad on one of my websites.

For example, about a year ago, during the worst of the recession, I had someone offer to pay me a little money to place a text ad up on maradns.org and samiam.org. The person insisted that the ad be permanent. I told him I wasn’t going to do that; he got agitated and I finally handled it by ignoring the person. Nothing is forever.

I finally have come up with a policy and pricing structure for these people (the price is, yes, a little high, but that is a case of giving invoice therapy):

The fee for a simple text-based ad on samiam.org is $50 per month. The fee for a simple text-based ad at maradns.org is $100 per month. This fee is paid by sending money to my PayPal account; the text ad will be placed after 100% of the first month's fee is paid. This fee is to be paid in full one week before the first day of the month when the text ad appears. The fee is not prorated; if you wish a text-based ad to be placed immediately, you must pay for the entire month.

Please allow up to seven calendar days for a given text ad request to be processed.

Multiple months can be paid for, but fractional months are not allowed (I would just pocket the extra money). There is a 10% discount if you pay for an entire year's worth of text-based ads.

Anyone willing to pay this fee will be listed as a sponsor on the MaraDNS list of sponsors for the foreseeable future; this listing will include the content of your text-based ad.

Simple text-based ads will be placed at the top of the content area of the "portal" page before my main content, and separated from my content with a <hr> HTML tag. Text based ads can include links, but the only other markup allowed is italics.

All text-based ads must be approved by me before being placed on my site; any changes to text-based ads are subject to prior approval. Text ads for pornography or advocating any illegal activity (as per US law) will not be accepted. Fees paid for rejected text ads are non-refundable.

### [Why I don’t do free private email support](http://maradns.blogspot.com/2010/05/why-i-dont-do-free-private-email.html)

Every now and then, I get someone who gets really angry at me when I give them the “pay up or take it to the mailing list” form reply from me after sending me a request for unpaid private MaraDNS support. This is not very good for the user in question; since the form reply makes it clear I can make replies to my form letter public, they end up publicly embarrassed when I forward their rude email to the MaraDNS list.

The reason why I don’t do unpaid support is because MaraDNS is an open-source project. Open source fundamentally changes the customer-supplier relationship; the thinking behind open source is that I supply something that benefits the community as a whole. The community, in return, benefits MaraDNS.

If I answer a private MaraDNS support email for free, I am not doing anything to benefit the MaraDNS community. I am only benefiting one particular user of MaraDNS.

MaraDNS users with support concerns should help MaraDNS by either paying me (which encourages me to work harder on MaraDNS), or by making their support concern public; this way any reply to their email is public and the next person with the same concern can quickly find the answer to their question in the [MaraDNS mailing list archives](http://woodlane.webconquest.com/pipermail/list/).
