Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-3590 (and CVE-2007-3589)

**Vulnerable Software:** b1gbb version 2.24.0

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in `showthread.php` and `showboard.php` through the `id` parameter.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS via the `user` parameter in `visitenkarte.php`.

**Root Cause:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of `showthread.php` and `showboard.php` allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Insufficient output encoding of the `user` parameter within the `visitenkarte.php` script permits injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   An attacker could potentially bypass authentication by extracting user credentials. The provided example shows how to extract usernames and passwords from the `cebb_user` table.
    *   Full database compromise is possible depending on the database user permissions.
    *   Data modification or deletion
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript, allowing for actions like cookie stealing, session hijacking, and redirecting victims to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** HTTP GET requests to vulnerable `showthread.php` and `showboard.php` files with a specially crafted `id` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** HTTP GET requests to the `visitenkarte.php` script with a malicious payload in the `user` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker only needs to send crafted requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific privileges or network access (beyond standard HTTP) is necessary. The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Information:**
*   The provided exploit examples demonstrate the SQL injection by using a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to retrieve usernames and passwords.
*   The XSS exploit example injects a simple JavaScript `alert(1)` for demonstration.
*   The content also includes Google dorks for identifying vulnerable instances.
*   This vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 2007-06-28.
