How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

2007/07/10 Norman replays the following:
"Sergio,
We have discussed your mail. It is not our company's policy
to publish information about vulnerabilities or bugs in our
software, unless they are extremely critical and/or can be
worked around by the end-user. There are usually a large
number of vulnerabilities/bugs in any software, and in our
opinion it would only serve to unsettle user confidence in the
products if the industry continually feeds information about
such weaknesses, and we don't see that it would give the user
any benefit in return.
Instead we feel that it should be the supplier's
responsibility to correct any errors and weaknesses and have
them released to the user fast and silently, without alerting
also the malware industry.
Hence, there is no forum where we can credit you for your
findings.
We sincerely appreciate that you notify us whenever you find a
vulnerability in our software, as we appreciate such
information from other sources. These findings, in addition
to bug reports, are continuously being reviewed with respect
to seriousness and work involved in fixing the problems, and
assigned priorities accordingly, but no estimated dates for
fixing the issues are published.
This has always been - and presently is - our company's
policy. This policy may of course be revised by company
management at any time, if deemed necessary or useful."
2007/07/11 n.runs replays that when they request the PoC files
they implicitly accepted n.runs RFP and that the last
mail was violating n.runs RFP and request a soon
replay, otherwise the advisories would have to be
release uncoordinated.
2007/07/23 Norman DID NOT replay
2007/07/23 n.runs assumes that Norman finalized their
