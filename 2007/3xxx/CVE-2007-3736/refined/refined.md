Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-3736:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a race condition that occurs during the execution of `addEventListener()` and `setTimeout()` functions. When these functions are called on a window, and a new page load is initiated mid-call, the execution of these functions can continue within the context of the newly loaded page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a failure to maintain proper context when executing `addEventListener()` and `setTimeout()` during a page navigation. This leads to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
*   **Inconsistent Object Context:** The execution of code related to `addEventListener()` and `setTimeout()` can occur in the context of a different document than intended, violating same-origin policies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts into a target site's context.
*   **Data Theft:**  This could allow attackers to access and exfiltrate sensitive information from the target site such as cookies or credentials.
*   **Content Modification:** Attackers could modify the appearance or behavior of the target site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** Attackers can host a malicious web page which triggers the vulnerability in browsers of users who visit it.
*   **Timing-Based Exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires precise timing, where the page load has to occur during the execution of `addEventListener()` or `setTimeout()`, potentially while the arguments of those functions are still being evaluated, or passed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create a webpage:** The attacker must be able to create a web page which triggers the exploit.
*   **No direct interaction with the target:** The attack can occur when the victim navigates to the malicious page in their browser.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs within the implementation of the `addEventListener()` and `setTimeout()` JavaScript methods.
*   During the execution of these methods, while converting arguments, a page load can be initiated, causing the execution to transfer to the new page while preserving the context.
*   The root of the problem is in the way that the window object's inner object is managed during these operations, and how callbacks are attached.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the inner window is used in the appropriate places in code.

**Additional Information from Bugzilla:**

*   The issue was identified by a reporter named `moz_bug_r_a4`.
*   The vulnerability was present in multiple versions of Firefox, including 1.5.x and 2.0.x.
*   Patches were developed to address the issue, and the fixes were applied to both the trunk and branch versions of the browser.
*   The bug was marked as `fixed` and `verified`.

**Summary:**

CVE-2007-3736 describes an XSS vulnerability caused by a race condition when calling  `addEventListener()` or `setTimeout()`, which could allow attackers to inject scripts into a target's site, steal data or modify page behavior.
