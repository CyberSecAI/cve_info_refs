| [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=243719#c1)  Mark J. Cox    2007-06-11 14:59:26 UTC  ``` Olaf Kirch from Oracle found two issues in open-iscsi   1)     iscsid provides a management interface using an AF_LOCAL         socket. To prevent unauthorized users from messing with it, it         checks for the client's uid by doing a getsockopt(SO_PEERCRED).          Unfortunately, it performs this operation on the *listening* socket,         rather than the newly accepted connection. This will always return         a uid of 0, effectively allowing everyone to perform management         operations on the iSCSI initiator.          It currently appears as if the impact is limited to DoS, as there's         no obvious way for an attacker to retrieve eg passwords, or         gain privilege. There's a whole lot of code though, so maybe         there's a buffer overflow lurking somewhere that can be exploited.          However, at a minimum this allows an attacker to shoot down iscsid,         or tear down individual iSCSI connections.          [CVE-2007-3099](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-3099)   2)     iscsid uses a rather fanciful logging mechanism, where         the main process logs to a shared memory area, from         where a child process picks up the messages and feeds         them to syslog. This is protected by a semaphore created         with mode 0666. This allows anyone to up the semaphore.         iscsid will block on the next attempt to log something, and         hang indefinitely.          [CVE-2007-3100](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-3100)  Should be public later today, marking as embargoed for now.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=243719#c2)  Mark J. Cox    2007-06-11 15:03:43 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 156720](attachment.cgi?id=156720&action=diff "cve-2007-3099 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=156720&action=edit "cve-2007-3099 patch") [cve-2007-3099](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-3099) patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=243719#c3)  Mark J.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security update for open-iscsi

## Knowledgebase

*(Last modified: 07AUG2007)*

---

**solutions**
Security update for open-iscsi
SuSE Linux Maintenance Web (187174044e1dbe78726bcf840f7530ed)

### Applies to

**Package**: open-iscsi

**Product(s)**: SLE SDK 10 SP1 for x86

SLE SDK 10 SP1 for IPF

SLE SDK 10 SP1 for IBM iSeries and IBM pSeries

SLE SDK 10 SP1 for IBM zSeries

SLE SDK 10 SP1 for X86-64

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP1 for x86

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP1 for IPF

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP1 for IBM POWER

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP1 for IBM zSeries 64bit

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP1 for AMD64 and Intel EM64T

**Zypp-Patch-Number:** 4035

**Release:**  20070807

**Obsoletes:** none

### Indications

Everyone using open-iscsi should install this update.

### Contraindications

None.

### Problem description

Two vulnerabilites to denial of service in the open-iscsi daemon have been found. The daemon does not properly check the credentials of the process connecting to the management interface, which could be abused by an attacker to disrupt iSCSI connections. Likewise, a semaphore for a shared memory segment of the logging mechanism has too broad permissions, which allows local users to block the daemon on the next attempt to log an event.

These DoS vulnerabilities are tracked by CVE-2007-3099 and CVE-2007-3100.

### Solution

Please install the updates provided at the location noted below.

### Installation notes

This update is provided as an RPM package that can easily be installed onto a running system by using this command:

`rpm -Fvh open-iscsi.rpm`

Debian Security Advisory DSA 1314-1                    security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                         Moritz Muehlenhoff
June 19th, 2007                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : open-iscsi
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : local/remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-3099 CVE-2007-3100

Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in
open-iscsi, a transport-independent iSCSI implementation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-3099

    Olaf Kirch discovered that due to a programming error access to the
    management interface socket was insufficiently protected, which allows
    denial of service.

CVE-2007-3100

    Olaf Kirch discovered that access to a semaphore used in the logging
    code was insufficiently protected, allowing denial of service.

The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include open-iscsi.

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 2.0.730-1etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.865-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your open-iscsi packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
