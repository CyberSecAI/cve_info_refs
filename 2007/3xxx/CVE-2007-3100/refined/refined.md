{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The open-iscsi daemon's logging mechanism uses a semaphore created with mode 0666. This allows any local user to manipulate the semaphore, leading to a denial-of-service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure permissions on a semaphore used by the logging mechanism."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can block the iscsid daemon, causing it to hang indefinitely and preventing it from logging further events. This results in a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system where the open-iscsi daemon is running."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs local user privileges to manipulate the semaphore.",
     "additional_information": "The iscsid daemon uses a shared memory area for logging, where a child process picks up messages and feeds them to syslog. This shared memory access is controlled by a semaphore. The vulnerability arises because the semaphore is created with overly permissive mode 0666, allowing any local user to signal the semaphore and block the daemon's attempts to log events."
