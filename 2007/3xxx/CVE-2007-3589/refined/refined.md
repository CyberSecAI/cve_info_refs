{
  "CVE-2007-3589": {
    "root_cause": "The b1gbb forum software has SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL Injection: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in `showthread.php` and `showboard.php` allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.",
       "XSS: The `visitenkarte.php` script is vulnerable to XSS by injecting a script tag through the `user` parameter."
    ],
    "impact": "SQL injection allows the attacker to extract sensitive information such as usernames and passwords from the `cebb_user` table. XSS allows the execution of arbitrary javascript in user's browsers, which can be used for session hijacking, phishing attacks, or defacement.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "SQL Injection: By manipulating the `id` parameter in the `showthread.php` and `showboard.php` scripts with crafted SQL queries.",
       "XSS: By injecting javascript code through the `user` parameter in the `visitenkarte.php` script."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable application is hosted."
