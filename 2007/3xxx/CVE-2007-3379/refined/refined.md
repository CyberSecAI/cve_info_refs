{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `get_gate_vma()` function in the x86_64 kernel, specifically how it handles the Virtual Memory Area (VMA) for the vsyscall page. When `fuser(1)` tries to access the vsyscall page, it can trigger a kernel oops due to incorrect VMA handling.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect VMA handling in `get_gate_vma()` function.",
      "Potential null pointer dereference when accessing vsyscall page."
    ],
    "impact": "A user-triggered call to `fuser(1)` on x86_64 systems can cause a kernel oops, leading to system instability or a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system.",
       "Execution of the `fuser` command"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
       "Ability to execute commands on the local system."
    ],
	 "additional_information": "The fix involves an upstream patch that modifies the behavior of the `get_gate_vma()` function for the x86_64 architecture to correctly handle the vsyscall page's VMA. The issue was triggered by the `fuser` utility trying to access this page, which exposed the incorrect handling"
