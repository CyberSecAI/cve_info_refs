The provided content discusses multiple potential XSS vulnerabilities in the PHPIDS (PHP Intrusion Detection System) filter rules and ways to bypass them. It does not directly describe a specific vulnerability that matches CVE-2007-3578. However, it details multiple weaknesses and bypasses. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities and bypasses discussed:

**1. IE Script Handling Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Internet Explorer translates certain prefixes before `script:` to `vbscript:` or `javascript:`.
*   **Weakness:** IE interprets `??script:`, `???script:` prefixes as `vbscript:`, and `????script:` as `javascript:`.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute VBScript or Javascript by using these prefixes followed by the code.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted URLs or inputs containing the vulnerable script prefixes.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to inject a malicious script prefix via a URL or other input field.

**2. `document.location.search` and `document.referrer` Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of filtering for `document.location.search` and `document.referrer`.
*   **Weakness:** `document.location.search` and `document.referrer` are not filtered, allowing extraction of GET parameters and referrer URLs, respectively.
*  **Impact:** Attackers can redirect a user to a malicious page that includes executable code within the referrer URL, or by using URL parameters.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted URLs or websites that redirect to a vulnerable site, passing code through these variables.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to redirect the victim to a vulnerable site with malicious code in the referrer or query parameters.

**3. VBScript Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:**  PHPIDS filter doesn't validate VBScript.
*   **Weakness:** The filter doesn't check for VBScript execution.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject and execute VBScript.
*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious code injection using VBScript.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Requires injection of malicious VBScript code.

**4. Rule Bypass - `document.location.hash`:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The rule `(?:(?:location)?[. ]\*hash[. ]\*(?:substr(?:ing)?|replace)\s?\()` can be bypassed.
*   **Weakness:** The rule that detects self-contained XSS payloads is circumvented using `document.location.hash.split(document.location.hash.charAt(0)).join()` or `document.location.hash[String().substr.toString().substr(9,6)](1)`.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the hash portion of the URL.
*   **Attack Vector:** Using specially crafted JavaScript within the hash portion of the URL.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs to control the hash portion of the URL.

**5. Rule Bypass - `alert`, `prompt`, `confirm`...:**

*   **Root Cause:** The rule that detects `alert`, `prompt`, `confirm`, etc. can be bypassed.
*   **Weakness:**  The rule can be circumvented using `window[eval.toString().substr(9,4)](--code_here--)` or `Function(--code_here--)();`.
*  **Impact:** Allows attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript via eval or Function constructors.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting the bypass method with malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Need to be able to inject the bypass code into input that is not properly filtered.

**6. Combined Bypass:**

*   **Root Cause:** Combining `document.location.hash` bypass with other bypasses
*   **Weakness:** Can use  `Function(document.location.hash[String().substr.toString().substr(9,6)](1))();`  to run code within `site.com/#code-here`.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code by combining multiple bypass techniques
*   **Attack Vector:** Combining bypass techniques.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to control the URL hash and inject it into an application that does not adequately validate it.

**7. Attribute Injection Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect handling of quotes and characters in attribute values.
*   **Weakness:**  The filter doesn't properly escape/handle  `x' y" z" awesome"whatever='something'` allowing attributes to be set.
*   **Impact:** Allows the injection of arbitrary attributes, including `style`, leading to possible XSS.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting the above mentioned string into an attribute, potentially leading to a style injection attack.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to insert the crafted string into a vulnerable attribute context

**8. `with` Statement Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of filtering of the `with` statement.
*   **Weakness:** The `with` statement was not filtered, allowing code execution within the scope of a document.
*  **Impact:** Allows attackers to manipulate the document using the "with" keyword.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting  `with(document)location.href=cookie;`
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Need to be able to inject the `with` keyword into an exploitable input context.

**9. Newline Handling Vulnerability:**

*  **Root Cause:** Error in the handling of new lines.
*   **Weakness:** The filter had an error handling new lines, which could lead to `eval` being reached and code execution, for example using `for each(screw\n in window)try{screw(code\n)}catch(rock_and_roll){1}`.
*   **Impact:** Allows code execution by exploiting the way new lines are handled within the `for each` statement and leveraging the `eval` function.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting the above mentioned string with a carefully crafted payload that uses newlines.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Must be able to inject the complex code pattern that includes newlines

In summary, this content provides a variety of potential cross-site scripting vulnerabilities that could be used to attack web applications using PHPIDS, but it does not describe a vulnerability that matches CVE-2007-3578. The content focuses on vulnerabilities within the PHPIDS filtering logic itself, not the systems that PHPIDS would protect.
