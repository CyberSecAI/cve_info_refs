  "cve": "CVE-2007-3039",
  "description": "The Microsoft Windows Message Queuing Service suffers from a stack-based buffer overflow, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of opnum 0x06 of the RPC interface defined on port 2103 with UUID fdb3a030-065f-11d1-bb9b-00a024ea5525.  A vulnerable wcscat() call copies user-supplied information into a fixed-length stack buffer. Sending at least 300 bytes will trigger the overflow.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "weakness": "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing attackers to gain complete control of the affected system. On Windows XP, local elevation of privilege is possible by leveraging the vulnerability.",
      "attack_vector": "Sending a specially crafted MSMQ message to the vulnerable RPC interface (port 2103).",
        "attacker_capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability on Windows 2000. On Windows XP, a local user with valid logon credentials is required."
    }
  ],
  "affected_products": [
    "Windows 2000 SP4",
    "Windows XP SP2"
   ],
  "patch_info": "Microsoft has released an update to address this vulnerability. The update modifies how the MSMQ service validates input strings before passing them to the buffer.",
    "additional_notes": "The Message Queuing component is not installed by default, meaning only systems with the component enabled are vulnerable. Firewall best practices and default firewall configurations can help protect networks from external attacks by blocking the relevant ports and RPC."
