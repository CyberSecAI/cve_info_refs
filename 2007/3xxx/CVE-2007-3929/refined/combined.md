## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

# Opera: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200708-17**

Opera contain several vulnerabilities, some of which may allow the
execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/opera** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **9.23** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **9.23** |

### Background

Opera is a multi-platform web browser.

### Description

An error known as "a virtual function call on an invalid pointer" has
been discovered in the JavaScript engine (CVE-2007-4367). Furthermore,
iDefense Labs reported that an already-freed pointer may be still used
under unspecified circumstances in the BitTorrent support
(CVE-2007-3929). At last, minor other errors have been discovered,
relative to memory read protection (Opera Advisory 861) and URI
displays (CVE-2007-3142, CVE-2007-3819).

### Impact

A remote attacker could trigger the BitTorrent vulnerability by
enticing a user into starting a malicious BitTorrent download, and
execute arbitrary code through unspecified vectors. Additionally, a
specially crafted JavaScript may trigger the "virtual function"
vulnerability. The JavaScript engine can also access previously freed
but uncleaned memory. Finally, a user can be fooled with a too long
HTTP server name that does not fit the dialog box, or a URI containing
whitespaces.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time for all these
vulnerabilities.

### Resolution

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.23"
```
