Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-3156:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input passed to the `pam_login.cgi` script before being returned to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `pam_login.cgi` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code into a user's browser session when they access a crafted URL.
- This can lead to the theft of session cookies, potentially allowing the attacker to log in to Webmin or Usermin with the user's privileges.
- Depending on the privileges of the user whose session is hijacked, an attacker could gain significant access to the Webmin/Usermin system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker entices a user to visit a specially crafted, malicious URL while the user is logged into Webmin or Usermin.
- The crafted URL exploits the XSS vulnerability in the `pam_login.cgi` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and get a logged-in user to access it.
- The attacker does not need to have prior authentication credentials to the Webmin/Usermin system itself. They exploit the XSS to potentially steal credentials from valid users.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Webmin versions prior to 1.350 and Usermin versions prior to 1.280.
- The vulnerability is present in both Webmin and Usermin as they share the vulnerable `pam_login.cgi` file.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 200707-05) confirms the XSS vulnerability and recommends users to update to the specified versions
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
