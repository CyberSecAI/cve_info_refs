Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Input passed via the URL, specifically the "path" parameter in `filedetails.php`, was not properly sanitized before being returned to the user. This lack of sanitization allowed for the injection of malicious HTML and script code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application was vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML and script code into a user's browser session, within the context of the vulnerable website.
- This could potentially lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing of sensitive information
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious sites
  - Other client-side attacks

**Attack vectors:**
- URL Parameter Manipulation: The attacker injects malicious code through the "path" parameter in `filedetails.php` within a crafted URL.
- User interaction: The victim needs to visit the manipulated link for the attack to be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the injected code.
- They need to lure a victim into clicking the link, or otherwise make them access it.
- No special privileges or network position are mentioned as requirements.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was reported in WebSVN version 2.0rc4, but other versions may have been affected.
- The issue was fixed in WebSVN version 2.0
- Gentoo Bugzilla entry confirms the XSS vulnerability in websvn < 2.0
