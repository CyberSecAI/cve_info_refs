Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `bloggie_root_path` parameter within multiple PHP files of myBloggie 2.1.5. This allows an attacker to include remote files via HTTP.
*   **Weakness:**  The primary vulnerability is a **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**. The application fails to validate and sanitize the `bloggie_root_path` parameter, allowing the inclusion of arbitrary remote files.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this RFI vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Complete compromise of the server.
    *   Data theft or manipulation.
    *   Installation of malware.
    *   Denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTTP requests by appending the `bloggie_root_path` parameter with a URL pointing to a malicious remote file. The vulnerable PHP files include:
    *   `config.php`
    *   `includes/db.php`
    *   `includes/template.php`
    *   `includes/functions.php`
    *   `includes/classes.php`
    *   `viewmode.php`
    *   `blog_body.php`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   The attacker needs to have a web server hosting a malicious file that the vulnerable application can include.
    *   No authentication is required for exploitation.
