- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `idaiehlp.dll` browser helper object (BHO) of Internet Download Accelerator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `NotSafe` function of the `idaiehlp.dll`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, likely by crashing the browser or the application. Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided content, a carefully crafted payload could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted HTML page containing a specific object tag and VBScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to convince a victim to open a malicious HTML page in Internet Explorer that is using a vulnerable version of the Internet Download Accelerator. The attacker could achieve this through various methods, including phishing or hosting the malicious page on a website.
- The vulnerability exists within the user's browser, meaning that the attacker does not need any special privileges or system access prior to the user visiting the malicious site.
- The user must have the vulnerable browser helper object installed.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit targets the `NotSafe` method of the `idaiehlp.dll` BHO with an oversized string argument.
- The vulnerable BHO is identified by the CLSID: `{2A646672-9C3A-4C28-9A7A-1FB0F63F28B6}`.
- The exploit code includes a download link for the vulnerable software version: `http://download1.westbyte.com/ida/idasetup.exe`.
- Multiple versions of Internet Download Accelerator were reported vulnerable including versions 5.2 and 5.8.
-  The vulnerability is triggered by the `idaiehlp.NotSafe(arg1)` call in the VBScript, passing a large string as `arg1`.
