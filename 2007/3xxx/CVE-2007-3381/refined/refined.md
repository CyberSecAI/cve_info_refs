Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2007-3381:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how GDM (GNOME Display Manager) handles the output of the `g_strsplit()` function. Specifically, it does not properly check for NULL values returned by `g_strsplit()`, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Null pointer dereference:** The core issue is that GDM attempts to dereference a pointer that may be NULL if `g_strsplit()` fails or returns an empty result.
- **Improper input validation:** GDM does not validate the output of `g_strsplit()`, leading to the possibility of using an invalid pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of service (DoS):** A successful exploit crashes the GDM daemon.
- **Loss of display management:** After the crash, GDM stops managing displays, meaning new login sessions cannot be started and existing sessions might be disrupted.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local attack:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Crafted GDM socket command:** The attacker sends a carefully crafted command to the GDM socket (`/tmp/.gdm_socket`) that will trigger the vulnerable code path and result in a NULL value returned from `g_strsplit()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local user account:** The attacker needs a user account on the target machine.
- **Ability to send messages to the GDM socket:** The attacker needs the ability to write to `/tmp/.gdm_socket`.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected files:** The vulnerability is present in the following files: `daemon/gdm.c`, `daemon/gdmconfig.c`, `gui/gdmconfig.c`, and `gui/gdmflexiserver.c`
- **Fix:** The fix implemented was improved handling of null values returned from the `g_strsplit` calls.
- **Versions affected:** GDM versions prior to 2.18.4 and 2.16.7 are affected.
- **Gentoo Security Advisory:** Gentoo released GLSA 200709-11 for this issue, recommending an update to the latest version.
