The provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2007-3416.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a lack of referrer checks on administrative actions, specifically deletions, in multiple WebAPP features. This allows an attacker to induce an administrator to perform unintended actions through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing referrer checks in administrative interfaces for poll, profiles, IP bans, and forums.
- Vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- Lack of delete confirmation pages on some features.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can perform deletions as administrators by tricking them into following malicious links or through XSS on another page.
- Accidental deletion of data by administrators.

**Attack vectors:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) redirects on other pages.
- Tricky links that an administrator may be tricked into clicking.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link or visiting a page with an XSS vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to target a well-known administrator who is likely to have admin privileges and is a likely target.
