Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3523:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the `Galerie.php` script of XCMS 1.1. The script uses user-supplied input from the `Lang` GET parameter without proper sanitization. This unsanitized input is used in an `include()` statement, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary local files.
Additionally, the `Ent` parameter is also vulnerable to a directory listing vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `include('Lang/' . $Lang . '.lang');` line is vulnerable because the `$Lang` variable is taken directly from the `$_GET['Lang']` parameter. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can include any file on the server that the web server process has permission to access.
*   **Directory Listing:**  The `opendir("../Images/$Lang/$Ent");` is vulnerable to directory listing because the `$Ent` variable is taken directly from the `$_GET['Ent']` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Inclusion:** Successful exploitation of the LFI vulnerability allows an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, password files, or source code.
*   **Directory Listing:** Successful exploitation of the Directory Listing vulnerability allows the attacker to view directory structure, and determine the files they may try to access through the LFI vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to `Module/Galerie.php`.
*   By manipulating the `Lang` parameter with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../etc/passwd`), an attacker can include arbitrary local files.
*   By manipulating the `Ent` parameter with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../etc/`), an attacker can cause the script to list directory contents.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*   The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable script (`Module/Galerie.php`) on the target server.
*   The attacker does not need authentication, and the vulnerability can be triggered with a simple GET request.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided exploit-db content provides more detail than the official CVE description, including specific vulnerable code, exploit examples and directory listing vulnerability.
* The exploit example shows how to use the LFI vulnerability to read the `/etc/passwd` file by appending `%00` to the malicious path, this is to null terminate the path and avoid any further concatenation of file extensions.
