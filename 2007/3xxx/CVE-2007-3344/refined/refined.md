Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is used in the output. Specifically, the application does not sanitize the "album_id", "order", "sort", "filter", and "genre_id" parameters in "index.php", and the "url" parameter in "redirect.php".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS due to the lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML and script code into the web pages. This code will be executed in the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirecting the user to malicious sites

- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can also discover the full install path of the application by testing the vulnerable parameters.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface, by crafting malicious URLs containing the vulnerable parameters with injected script/HTML code.
  - For `index.php`, the vulnerable parameters are: `album_id`, `order`, `sort`, `filter`, and `genre_id`.
  - For `redirect.php`, the vulnerable parameter is `url`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can likely be exploited without prior authentication. The attacker can craft the malicious requests from any network that can reach the web server.

**Additional details:**
- The blog post from pridels-team.blogspot.com provides more detail than the typical CVE description. It lists specific vulnerable parameters and files, as well as the impact of the vulnerability. It also mentions that the full install path can be obtained by exploiting the XSS vulnerability.
- The netjukebox.nl changelog confirms that version 4.02 fixed the XSS issues.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is a classic example of XSS due to lack of proper input sanitization, which could lead to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser session and information disclosure of the install path of the application. The attacker can exploit it remotely without authentication by crafting malicious URLs.
