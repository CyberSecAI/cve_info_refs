RSBAC Changes
-------------
1.3.5:
- Check crypto return codes (2.6) and fixed UM password hashing.
- Fix compilation issues for "disable writing to disk". See bug #98.
- Safety mesures for inheritence in case of null pointers.
1.3.4:
- No changes :)
1.3.3:
- Change FD cache counters to 64 Bit to avoid wrapping.
- Make FD Cache xstats output look nicer.
- Make an adf\_request permission check when modyfing capabilities is the new set >> old one.
- Copy auth\_last\_auth on CLONE, gets reset on EXECUTE.
- Provide pid and process name in some UM debug output.
- 2.6 WARNING: sysrq key 'w' is GONE! no more wake up trigger possible
1.3.2:
- mark FS\_OBJ\_HIDE as EXPERIMENTAL and depends on it
- clean compilation warnings, data types and such.
- removed double "ready" message in rsbac\_do\_init()
- disable partner process check for unix socks by default.
- Show fd cache hits/misses ratio in xstats. Really inline rsbac\_is\_initialized().
- Change fd cache descriptor to get rid of separate compare function in 2.4 kernels.
- Add FD inherited attribute value cache. Hash device list. Allow per-list max\_ite
ms\_per\_hash.
- Change return code in AUTH syscalls to INVALIDATTR, if group or eff/fs support i
s not compiled in.
- port from ex 1.4 trunk: do not intercept PTRACE\_DETACH request
- rewrite of error handling to be more logical in rsbac\_handle\_filldir().
- Also take partner pid from other on Unix socket stream connects.
- Accept syscalls from tools with all versions 1.3.x.
- Take partner process on UNIXSOCK CONNECT from other->sk\_peercred.
- Try to get partner process for UNIXSOCK RECEIVE from other sources, if peercred is not filled.
- New error code INVALIDLIST, if list handle is invalid.
- New jail flags for syslog jail.
- Extra check before reiserfs secure\_delete call.
- Fix Dazuko device registration in 2.6. Return INVALIDPOINTER for invalid pointer
s in some syscalls.
- lvm/md automount fix
- Fix oops on loop umounts: device was auto-mounted, if there were dirty lists. Ne
ver auto-mount loop devices.
-
1.3.1:
- Add xstats counter for get\_parent calls.
- Fix sort order of network templates.
- Add missing DAZ request in vector. Add role number in RC syscall denied log message.
- Create bitmasks for each module of which requests it is interested in and only call request\_xy and set\_attr\_xy, if necessary.
- small performance tunning: removed usage of rsbac\_list\_compare\_u32 (always use memcmp which is asm-tuned per arch)
- Reduce stack usage in list, ACL and RC init.
- Optimize list hash functions with bit masks instead of % operation.
- make sure that rsbac\_list\_max\_hashes and rsbac\_list\_lol\_max\_hashes are always potential of 2 and warn the user at configuration time. (127 will round to 64).
1.3.0:
- Restarted 1.3 tree from the 1.2.7 release
- System call rsbac\_version to return numeric version without checking the callerâs version provided to syscall.
- JAIL: allow\_parent\_ipc to allow IPC into parent jail. Useful with Apache mod\_jail and others. Needs another process attribute jail\_parent
- JAIL: add a flag to allow suid/sgid files and dirs.
- Optionally check CHANGE\_OWNER for PROCESS targets also as CHANGE\_OWNER on the new USER. This allows fine grained control also in RC and ACL models.
- Change network templates to hold up to 25 ip networks and up to 10 port ranges.
- Automatic online resizing of per-list hash table. As list identifiers are pointers to list headers, which must not change, the arrays of list heads are allocated separately and accessed through a pointer.
- Change named UNIX sockets to be new filesystem target type T\_UNIXSOCK and unnamed to be new IPC type anonunix (like pipes)
- RC role def\_unixsock\_create\_type, which overrides the def\_(ind\_)fd\_create\_type. Default value use\_def\_fd.
- Change aci, acl and auth devices lists to use RCU on 2.6 kernels
- Dazuko udev support
- UM password history with configurable length to avoid password reuse.
- Update HTML doc in Documentation/rsbac, or point all docs to the website.
- Hide dir entries a process has no SEARCH right for
- Limit number of items per single list to 50000, so real limit is at 50000 \* nr\_hashes.
- New request type AUTHENTICATE against USER targets. No authentication against RSBAC UM without this right in RC and ACL.
- Complete hook review with several small fixes.
- More detailed JAIL decision logging for IPC and UNIXSOCK targets with rsbac\_debug\_adf\_jail.
1.2.7:
- Use new PaX flags location at current->mm->pax\_flags.
- Removed remaining non-RSBAC code
1.2.6:
- DAZ Renaming of files from non-scanned to scanned directory
now works correctly (does not cache results from non scanned
as CLEAN - and/but keep INFECTED status if set when moving file
from scanned to non-scanned)
- DAZ unscanned files decision is now DO\_NOT\_CARE instead of
GRANTED
- Full pathes returned by RSBAC do not display double
(or more) / with double (or more) mounts anymore.
ex: /home//bob => /home/bob
This allows DAZ path based scanning to function normally.
- Fix setting of RC IPC type with def\_ipc\_create\_type.
- Added ptrace hook for m32r architecture.
- New kthread notification code.
- Fix xstats to include GROUP targets.
- Mark lists dirty again, if saving failed.
- Fix FF to allow file READ (but not READ\_OPEN) even with execute\_only.
- Stop making SEND and RECEIVE requests for STREAM sockets, if
CONFIG\_RSBAC\_NET\_OBJ\_RW is not set.
- Notify that shm is destroyed only when it really is (thanks rtp).
- Minor compile fixes
1.2.5: - AUTH config switch to globally allow setuid to user (real, eff, fs),
who started the program. Boot time option and proc setting to enable
per uid type.
- Show missing Linux caps in JAIL like in CAP.
- Change device attribute backup to use a list of attribute objects
instead of traversing /dev and possibly missing some.
- Device attribute inheritance: Use values at type:major as default for
type:major:minor.
- Add a generic request directly in sys\_ioctl with new request type
IOCTL on DEV and NETOBJ target.
- Finish ioctl extra interception with GET\_STATUS\_DATA and
MODIFY\_SYSTEM\_DATA, e.g. for SCSI.
- Store remote IP when process accepted its first INET connection as
process attribute and pass on to children. Log remote IP in request
log.
- Symlink redirection based on remote IP.
- Optional UM password limits: Min length, non-alpha char required
- Fix EINVALIDPOINTER when changing UM password with passwd via
pam\_rsbac.
- Complete system call interception review with additional hooks where
necessary. See Interceptions log for details.
- Change USER attribute backup to list of known items.
- Fix dereference bug related to rsbac\_get\_parent: set\_attr call in
do\_exec sometimes used file struct after freeing.
- Fix 2.6.11 random file not found errors, caused by symlink redirection
and ext2/ext3 kernel fs layer violation.
- Add CREATE and DELETE notifications in um syscalls.
- Make RC apply default\_{user|group}\_create\_type on {USER|GROUP} CREATE.
- Configure module switching per module. Only allow switching stateful
models on after switching off with extra kernel config switch.
- Review all devision modules, whether they decide on all relevant
request to target combinations and whether they protect all relevant
attributes.
- Full review of all interceptions to make them locks safe
- Fix initrd problems showing up with the Adamantix kernel
1.2.4: - Per dir FD type RC default\_fd\_create\_type
- Full kernel space user management as a replacement for /etc/passwd,
/etc/shadow, /etc/group
- Add GROUP target type
- Change RC copy\_role to be allowed with role in admin\_roles
- Log full program path, get dentry from mappings for this
- Make RSBAC remote logging target configurable at boot or runtime.
Suppress remote logging, if address or port is 0.
- audit\_uid: Default value "unset". Set at CHANGE\_OWNER away from a uid
!= 0, kept, inherited to child processes and logged. Allows to log
actions of users who did an su etc. Configurable additional uid per
program which works like uid 0, e.g. for SSHD privilege separation
(new attr auid\_exempt).
- AUTH protection for Linux group IDs.
- New kernel flag: rsbac\_softmode\_once: Sets softmode, but denies
setting it again during runtime. For those systems that for some
reason must start in softmode, disable it and do not want to have it
set again later.
- New kernel flag: rsbac\_softmode\_never: Disallows setting softmode
during this runtime.
- Keep last UM authenticated users in a per-process attribute
auth\_last\_auth. Allow processes with auth\_may\_set\_cap flag to set
last\_auth.
- New kernel flag: rsbac\_freeze: Disallows all modifying administration
in RSBAC syscalls. Added new switch target FREEZE.
- Make PaX default flags configurable.
- RC check access to UNIX socket partner process
- Transaction support for administration: begin, add a set of desired
changes, commit atomically or forget.
- Add RC copy\_type, to be allowed with ADMIN right.
- User Management "exclusive mode": Only users and groups known to
RSBAC UM can be reached. Kernel parameter and /proc setting to
temporarily disable the restrictions.
- Randomize UM password salt better
- Optionally randomize transaction numbers
- Reduce memory consumption of rsbac\_do\_init.
- Further reduce RSBAC's stack usage to prepare for 4 KB kernel stack
size.
- Password protection for transaction operations refresh, forget, commit
- Add hooks with MODIFY\_SYSTEM\_DATA on SCD network to queueing
administration
- Warn explicitely, if CAP max\_caps do not get applied because of
running in softmode.
- Update Dazuko interface to 2.0.5
- Update defconfig in all archs
- ACLs for Users and Linux groups
- Extend AUTH auth\_may\_setuid flag with values last\_auth\_only and
last\_auth\_and\_gid to allow last authenticated uid to be reached.
The second allows all group ids, too, because you cannot auth for
them. No longer add process cap at UM authentication, but rather
check at CHANGE\_OWNER with last\_auth process attribute.
- Fix severe Oopses when forgetting transactions with lists of lists.
- Optionally log all denied calls to capable() function with
CONFIG\_RSBAC\_CAP\_LOG\_MISSING
1.2.3: - Port to linux kernel 2.6.0-test with LSM
- New JAIL flag allow\_clock for ntpd encapsulation
- Removed LSM support (see http://rsbac.org/documentation/why\_rsbac\_does\_not\_use\_lsm).
- Global AUTH learning mode
- AUTH cap inheritance from parent dir (single step only, not
accumulated)
- RC pretty-print config output
- Remove 2.2 kernel support.
- Improve AUTH learning mode to use special value for same user
- Trigger AUTH learning mode per program
- Show type, name and mode of new object in T\_DIR/CREATE request log.
- Statix PaX support decision module
- Faked (root) user ID in ''getuid()'' to make stupid programs with uid
checks happy.
- Full log separation between syslog and RSBAC log, also for debug
messages (except rsbac\_debug\_aef). RSBAC now really shuts up, if
rsbac\_nosyslog is set, and sends everything to RSBAC own log only.
- ACL learning mode for user rights to filesystem objects, parameter
rsbac\_acl\_learn
- New RC syscall to get current role
- mac\_trusted\_for\_user with list instead of single user.
- Block fchdir outside the jail, if some stupid program opened a dir,
called rsbac\_jail() and then called fchdir(). Done by simply closing
all open dirs after rsbac\_jail() called chroot.
- Fixed some JAIL bugs found, all relevant chroot items from regression
suite solved. Not urgent enough and too many changes to make a 1.2.2
bugfix.
- Added JAIL Linux Capability restriction
- Dazuko integration as fixed module, as replacement for MS module
- Dazuko result caching with generic lists (as in old MS module)
- AUTH special value for eff and fs uid (thanks to Arnout Engelen)
- New optional rsbac\_jail parameter max\_caps, which limits the Linux
capabilities of all processes in the jail
- Optionally hide process ids without GET\_STATUS\_DATA in /proc/
dir listing
- /proc/rsbac-info/active to get current version and list of active
modules: One line each for version, mode: Secure/Softmode/Maintenance,
softmode: available/unavailable and one line per module: on/softmode/off
- Solve the new "kernel complains about vmalloc with lock" uglyness:
removed all vmalloc use in 2.6 kernels, too many workarounds needed.
- Protect sysfs objects in 2.6 kernels
- Added three real life example REG modules to rsbac/adf/reg,
contributed by Michal Purzynski
- Changed DEV list descriptor to be compatible between 2.4 and 2.6
kernels
- Added RC types and compatibility settings for USER targets
- Allow to set a different RC boot role than that of user root
- Add RC process type for kernel threads
1.2.2: - Added ms\_need\_scan attribute for selective scanning
- MS module support for F-Protd as scanning engine
- ms\_need\_scan FD attribute for selective scanning
- JAIL flag allow\_inet\_localhost to additionally allow to/from
local/remote IP 127.0.0.1
- RSBAC syscall version numbers
- New RES module with minimum and maximum resource settings for
users and programs
- Moved AUTH module to generic lists with ttl
- Added new requests CHANGE\_DAC\_(EFF|FS)\_OWNER on PROCESS targets
for seteuid and setfsuid (configurable)
- Added caps and checks for effective and fs owner to AUTH module
(optional)
- Changed behaviour on setuid etc.: Notification is always sent, even
if the uid was set to the same value. This allows for restricted RC
initial roles with correct role after setuid to root.
- New Process Hiding feature in CAP module
- Delayed init for initial ramdisks: delay RSBAC init until the first
real device mount.
- rsbac\_init() syscall to trigger init by hand, if not yet
initialized - can be used with e.g. rsbac\_delayed\_root=99:99, which
will never trigger init automatically.
- MS module support for clamd as scanning engine.
- Almost complete reimplementation of the MAC model with many new
features.
- New system role 'auditor' for most models, which may read and flush
RSBAC own log.
1.2.1: - Added support for all other architectures.
- Cleaned up rsbac syscall filesystem name lookup and target type
checks.
- New module JAIL: preconfigured process encapsulation (see kernel
config help).
1.2.0: - Moved most lists to generic lists, splitting up between modules on
the way (GEN = general for all modules).
- DS for each module only included, if module is compiled in.
- New Linux Capabilities (CAP) module
- Split system\_role into mac\_role, fc\_role, etc. Please do not use
old A\_system\_role attribute any longer.
- Changed rsbac\_get/set\_attr interface to include target module
- Added module guessing from attribute into sys\_rsbac\_get/set\_attr,
if module is not given (value SW\_NONE).
- Added user and RC role based symlink redirection
- Added network and firewall config protection as SCD network and
firewall targets
- Added NETDEV, NETTEMP and NETOBJ targets for network access control.
- Added network templates for default NETOBJ attribute values
- Renamed /rsbac dir to /rsbac.dat to avoid name conflicts.
- RC model with unlimited roles and types
- Selective dir tree disabling of Linux DAC
- Generic list ordering (needed for templates and optimization)
- List optimization
- Generic time-to-live support in generic lists (new on-disk version)
- Support time-to-live for ACL group members and ACL entries
- copy\_net\_temp
- Individual module soft mode
- Support time-to-live for RC entries
- Backport to 2.2.20
1.1.2: - Own RSBAC memory allocation functions. Own RSBAC mem slabs in 2.4
kernels.
- Generic lists - simply register your list item sizes with filename
and persist flag, and a persistent list will be kept for you.
- Generic lists of lists, two level version.
- Moved pm\_data\_structures.c to new lists with proc backup files
Attention: There is no auto-update from older versions possible!
- proc backup files for RC and ACL are now optional
- New proc subdir pm, replaces old write\_list call
- rsbac\_pm write\_list call removed
- New FD aci version with new rc\_initial\_role and 16 bit ff\_flags
- New FF flag append\_only, which limits all write accesses to
APPEND\_OPEN and WRITE
- Fix for rename hole: rename could replace and thus delete an
existing file without DELETE check. Also performs secure\_delete, if
necessary
- New rsbac\_mount hook in change\_root for initial ramdisk
- Fixed missing Linux check in bad\_signal
- Added optional switch rsbac\_dac\_disable to disable Linux filesystem
access control
- Added count support for multiple mounts
- Added optional switch rsbac\_nosyslog to temporarily disable logging
to syslog
- Added config option for DEBUG code
1.1.1: - New target type FIFO, with a lot of cleanup, e.g. IPC type fifo
removed
- MAC module reworked, including MAC-Light option
- Several bugfixes
- Port to 2.4.0, 2.4.1 and 2.4.2
- New Makefiles with lists for 2.4 and without for 2.2 kernels
(Thanks to Edward Brocklesby for samples)
- init process default ACI now partly depends on root's ACI
- Optional interception of sys\_read and sys\_write.
Attention: you might have to add READ and WRITE rights to files,
fifos, dirs and sockets first, if upgrading from an older version
- REG overhaul. Now you can register syscall functions, everything is
kept in unlimited lists instead of arrays and registering is
versioned to allow for binary module shipping with REG version
checks.
- Inheritance is now fixed, except for MAC model
- MAC: optional inheritance, new option Smart Inheritance that tries
to avoid new attribute objects (see config help)
- New soft mode option: all decisions and logging are performed, but
DO\_NOT\_CARE is returned to enforcement. Off by default. See config
help for details.
- Optional initialization in extra rsbac\_initd thread.
1.1.0: - Port to 2.4.0-test11
- Interception of sys\_mmap and sys\_mprotect added. Now execution of
library code requires EXECUTE privilege on the library file, and
setting non-mmapped memory to EXEC mode requires EXECUTE on target
NONE.
- MAC Light option by Stanislav Ievlev added. See kernel config help or
modules.htm.
1.0.9c:
- Port to 2.4.0-test{[789]|10}, this means major changes to the lookup and
inheritance code - of course #ifdef'd
- Change string declarations to kmalloc. On the way moved
MAX\_PATH\_LEN restriction from 1999 to max\_kmalloc - 256
(>127K).
- Renamed several PM xy.class to xy.object\_class for C++
compatibility
- Added SCD type ST\_kmem
- Changed rc\_force\_role default to rc\_role\_inherit\_parent,
terminated at root dir with old default rc\_role\_inherit\_mixed.
This makes it much easier to keep a dir of force-roled binaries.
1.0.9b:
- Port to 2.3.42 - 2.3.99-pre3
- Port to 2.2.14 - 2.2.16
- 32 Bit Uid/Gid with new attribute versions
- User and program based logging
- AUTH capability ranges
- Made write to MSDOS fs a config option, so use it on your own risk
(see config help)
- MAC levels 0-252
- Added config option for ioport access (X support)
1.0.9a:
- Added group management to ACL module.
- Removed CONFIG\_RSBAC\_SYNC option.
- Added module hints to logging
- Added RC separation of duty (see models.htm)
- Added RC force role inherit\_up\_mixed and made it default setting
1.0.9: - Added registration of additional decision modules (REG)
- Wrote decision module examples (see README-reg and reg\_samples dir)
- Port to 2.2.8, 2.2.9, 2.2.10, 2.2.11, 2.2.12 (pre versions)
- Heavily changed RC model: Now it has a distinguished role-to-type
compatibility setting for each request type, instead of one setting
for all request types. This allows for much finer grained access
control.
Unfortunately there was no way to update existing role settings,
so those have to be reentered by hand. Still, the types entries are
kept.
- Set all MSDOS based file systems to read-only, because inode
numbers are likely to change between boots.
- Added Access Control List module. ACLs are kept on FILE, DIR,
DEV, IPC, SCD and PROCESS targets (IPC and PROCESS have only
one default ACL each). Each entry contains subject type (user,
rc\_role, group), subject id and the rights this subject has. Also,
rights are inherited from parents and from a target specific default
ACL.
See html/models.htm for details.
- Added optional full path logging.
1.0.8a:
- Port to 2.2.7
- File Flag no\_execute added to prevent execution, e.g. of user
binaries under /home tree. Can be circumvented by scripts via
'interpreter scriptname'.
1.0.8: - Port to 2.2.1
- Added /proc/rsbac-info/backup to provide an easier means of backup
for not device dependent stuff. To be extended.
- Added new Role Compatibility (RC) module.
- New on-disk binary layout, auto update from all versioned data
(1.0.5 upwards).
- AUTH module added to support proper authentification by enforcing
externally granted CHANGE\_OWNER capabilities.
- Save to disk inconsistency in PM sets fixed.
- MAC categories added, but limited to a fixed number of 64. Apart
from that, the MAC module categories are as proposed in the
Bell-LaPadula model.
- Port to 2.2.2
- Port to 2.2.3 with minor changes
- Port to 2.2.4
- Port to 2.2.5
1.0.7a:
- Added alpha support (with Shaun Savage). Has different storage sizes,
so default useraci does not work and you need a maint kernel.
- Added new error detection features for file/dir entries.
- Increasing of NR\_FD\_LISTS is now handled differently for error
detection reasons. See README-nrlists.
- Marked init functions as \_\_init - though saving a few KB doesn't
make such a big difference while using RSBAC... ;)
- Fixed memory leaks in write\_\*\_list while introducing vmalloc for
large lists. The number of file/dir lists is now only a matter of
performance and available memory.
- Added two flags to File Flags
- Port to 2.2.0-pre6
- Added secure deletion/truncation, needs a config switch to be
enabled. If on, all files marked with (inheritable) FF-flag
secure\_delete and all files marked as PM-personal data are zeroed on
deletion and truncation - if the regarding modules are switched on.
1.0.7: - Port to 2.1.131
- Added more fs types to non-writable: smbfs, ncpfs, codafs - so
there should be no writing on network mounts (unfortunately there
is no afs SUPER\_MAGIC)
- Added configuration option NO\_DECISION\_ON\_NETMOUNTS, which
additionally turns off all decisions for all these fs, so that
they are completely ignored
- Added attribute inheritance: Some attributes for files and dirs
have a special value 'inherit'. If this is set, the value of the
parent dir's attribute is used instead. This mechanism ends on
fs boundaries - each fs root dir gets old style standard values,
if attribute is set to 'inherit'.
Currently security\_level, object\_category and data\_type are
inheritable.
- Added configuration option DEF\_INHERIT. If set, default values for
inheritable attributes are \*inherit, rather than the old default.
This option setting should not differ between different RSBAC
kernels to avoid deeper confusion for administrators and
rsbac\_check().
- To support inheritance, added parameter inherit to both get\_attr
system calls. If on, the effective (possibly inherited) value is
returned, if off, the real value is returned.
- Corrected a security hole in receiving from / sending via datagram
sockets (thanks to Simone). Now a read/append open and a close
request are done for every datagram (if net support is configured,
as usual).
Attention: Programs that open an UDP socket as one user (e.g. root)
and then setuid to another (e.g. bin) may not be able
to access that socket, if the new user has insufficent
rights! (see config help)
Checking of net access can as before be turned on/off via
CONFIG\_RSBAC\_NET.
- Worked on rsbac\_check(). Is more stable now, but should only be
called under maximum of moderate load.
1.0.6: - Moved to 2.1.128
- Cleaned up old includes in syscalls.c
- Added RSBAC own logging in /proc/rsbac-info/rmsg, to be accessed
by modified klogd or sys\_rsbac\_log, restricted by most modules to
security officers.
Additionally, logging to standard syslog can be turned off to hide
security relevant log from all but those with explicit access.
- Added module File Flags with attribute ff\_flags for FILE/DIR
targets
- Added auto-update of last version attributes (only FD changed
though)
- Changed ms\_trusted from boolean to tristate: non-trusted, read,
full
- Fixed rm -r hang bug
- Added consistency check for RSBAC items, which can remove items for
deleted inodes (ext2 only) and entries containing only default
values (FILE/DIR targets only). It also recalculates item counts.
- Added sys\_rsbac\_check to trigger this check.
1.0.5:
- Rewrote most of attribute saving to disk. Now disk writing is never
done with a spinlock held, increasing stability significantly
(is this a taboo? if yes, where is it documented?)
- Changed write-to-disk behaviour: The old immediate write is no
longer default, but optional (CONFIG\_RSBAC\_SYNC\_WRITE). Instead,
sys\_rsbac\_write can be used from user space or a kernel daemon can
be activated to write changes automatically every n seconds
(CONFIG\_RSBAC\_AUTO\_WRITE)
- Added kernel param rsbac\_debug\_auto for the daemon - gives a good
overview of attribute change rate
- Added proc interface for statistics and many RSBAC settings
- Added rsbac\_adf\_request calls MODIFY\_SYSTEM\_DATA to sysctl.c
- Wrote man pages for all RSBAC syscalls (in Documentation/rsbac/man)
- Added version information and check for all file/dir/dev aci and
for log\_levels
- Added some more scan strings to Malware Scan module, had to change
string representation to a more general way
1.0.4:
- Port via 2.1.115 and 2.1.124 to 2.1.125
- IPC targets: changed ids for sockets from pid/fd combination to
pointer to sock structure, including (many) changes in the
handling.
- Added socket level scanning (tcp and udp) to module Malware Scan.
This feature can stop malware while still being transferred to
your system. Added new attributes for IPC, process and file/dir
targets to manage socket scan.
- Reordered configuration options
- Added CONFIG\_RSBAC\_NO\_WRITE to totally disable writing to disk for
testing purposes and kernel parameter rsbac\_debug\_no\_write to
temporarily disable disk writing
- Added CONFIG\_RSBAC\_\*\_ROLE\_PROTection for all role dependant
modules: Now change-owner (setuid etc.) can be restricted between
users with special roles - see configuration help for details
- Some more bugfixes, mostly to decision modules
1.0.4-pre2:
- Port to 2.1.111
- Attribute mac\_trusted\_for\_user added to FILE aci. Value meanings:
RSBAC\_NO\_USER (-3): program is not MAC-trusted
RSBAC\_ALL\_USERS (-4): program is MAC-trusted for all users
other user-ID: program is MAC-trusted, if invoked by this user
Especially the last is useful for daemon programs that can be
started by all users.
Init process is checked, too, but is MAC-trusted by default.
- Syscalls rsbac\_mac\_set/get\_max\_seclevel added. Now a process can
reduce its own maximum security level. Useful for wrapper daemons
like inetd after forking and before invoking another program.
- Object dependent logging #ifdef'd with configuration option.
- Configuration option 'Maintenance Kernel' added. Disables all other
options.
- removed CONFIG\_RSBAC\_ADMIN and rsbac\_admin() stuff - now we have
capabilities, and there is no suser() anymore to extend
- changed locking for Data Structures component from semaphores to
read/write spinlocks
- added (U)MOUNT requests for target DEV to sys\_(u)mount. Now both
target dir and device are checked for access (MAC: dir: read-write,
dev: depending on mount mode read or read-write). Note: After
mount, all file/dir accesses on this device are checked as usual.
- Moved checks for valid request/target combinations from MAC module
to extra functions in rsbac/adf/check.c.
1.0.3: - Target DEV added. Now devices can get their own attributes based
on major/minor numbers. Attributes based on their file representations
in /dev are no longer used for open, but still for all other calls.
MAC decisions on open requests for devices must be explicitely enabled
by mac\_check to keep system bootable.
Short rule: Only if contents is accessed, DEV attributes apply.
- Attribute object\_type removed, was not used anyway and maintained in
linux structures.
- Attributes log\_array\_low and log\_array\_high for FILE/DIR/DEV added,
providing individial request based logging for those objects.
- PM module: if DEV is personal\_data, neccessary access is checked
for new class DEV (can be changed to custom class)
- A couple of minor bugfixes done
1.0.2A: - Port to 2.0.34
- A few #ifdef CONFIG\_RSBAC\_USE\_RSBAC\_OWNER were missing, causing
error messages "rsbac\_set/get\_attr returned error" -> added

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
