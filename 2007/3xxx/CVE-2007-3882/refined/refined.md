```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the 'id' parameter of the 'index.php' script.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including administrator usernames and passwords, potentially gaining full access to the application.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing SQL injection payloads in the 'id' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application's web server and manipulate URL parameters.
