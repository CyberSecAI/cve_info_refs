  "CVE-2007-3896": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the Windows shell's insufficient handling of invalid URIs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper URI handling",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the logged-on user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted URI in an application or attachment",
      "Malicious website exploiting the vulnerability through Internet Explorer",
       "Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content or advertisements",
       "Banner advertisements or other methods to deliver web content"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a user to either open a malicious attachment or click on a link to a malicious website. Or the attacker can inject the malicious URI into a vulnerable website or advertisement. An attacker would have to create a specially crafted URI and provide the URI as input to an application on an affected system"
