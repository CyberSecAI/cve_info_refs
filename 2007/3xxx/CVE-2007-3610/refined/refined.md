Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-3610

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `categories_type.php` file of PHPVID 0.9.9. Specifically, the `cat` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application fails to sanitize the input provided through the `cat` parameter in `categories_type.php` before using it in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including:
    *   Admin usernames and passwords.
    *   Usernames and passwords of regular members.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete access to the application's data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to `categories_type.php`.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `cat` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL to craft injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
The exploit examples provided show how an attacker can use `UNION ALL SELECT` statements to retrieve data from the `admin_users` and `members` tables. The exploit replaces the `cat` parameter value with `-1` and then injects the SQL query using the `UNION ALL SELECT` clause.  The examples use `concat` to retrieve the username and password fields.

**Exploit Example:**
```
http://www.server.com/categories_type.php?cat=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,concat(admin_user,0x3a,admin_password),5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35/**/FROM/**/admin_users/*
```
```
http://www.server.com/categories_type.php?cat=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,3,concat(username,0x3a,password),5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35/**/FROM/**/members/*
```
These queries are designed to extract usernames and passwords from the database.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided Exploit-DB entry gives a good overview of the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is present in PHPVID version 0.9.9.
*   The advisory points out the administrator login is typically located at `/admin/`.
