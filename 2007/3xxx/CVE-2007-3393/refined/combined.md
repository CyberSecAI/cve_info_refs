## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

# Wireshark: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200708-12**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wireshark, allowing for
the remote execution of arbitrary code and a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-analyzer/wireshark** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **0.99.6** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **0.99.6** |

### Background

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer with a graphical front-end.

### Description

Wireshark doesn't properly handle chunked encoding in HTTP responses
(CVE-2007-3389), iSeries capture files (CVE-2007-3390), certain types
of DCP ETSI packets (CVE-2007-3391), and SSL or MMS packets
(CVE-2007-3392). An off-by-one error has been discovered in the
DHCP/BOOTP dissector when handling DHCP-over-DOCSIS packets
(CVE-2007-3393).

### Impact

A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets on a network
being monitored with Wireshark, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Wireshark which
might be the root user, or a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

In order to prevent root compromise, take network captures with tcpdump
and analyze them running Wireshark as a least privileged user.

### Resolution

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-0.99.6"
```

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : wireshark
Vulnerability  : several
Problem-Type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-3390 CVE-2007-3392 CVE-2007-3393

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark
network traffic analyzer, which may lead to denial of service. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-3390

    Off-by-one overflows were discovered in the iSeries dissector.

CVE-2007-3392

    The MMS and SSL dissectors could be forced into an infinite loop.

CVE-2007-3393

    An off-by-one overflow was discovered in the DHCP/BOOTP dissector.

The oldstable distribution (sarge) is not affected by these problems.
(In Sarge Wireshark used to be called Ethereal).

For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.4-5.etch.0. Packages for the big endian MIPS architecture
are not yet available. They will be provided later.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.99.6pre1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your Wireshark packages.

Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is the world's most popular network protocol analyzer. It
is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development, and education.

## What's New

### Bug Fixes

The following vulnerabilities have been fixed. See the
[security advisory](http://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2007-02.html) for details and a workaround.

* Wireshark could crash when dissecting an HTTP chunked
  response.
  (Bug [1394](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1394))

  Versions affected: 0.99.5
* On some systems, Wireshark could crash while reading
  iSeries capture files.
  (Bug [1415](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1415))

  Versions affected: 0.10.14 to 0.99.5
* Wireshark could exhaust system memory while reading a malformed
  DCP ETSI packet.
  (Bug [1264](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1264))

  Versions affected: 0.99.5
* Wireshark could loop excessively while reading a malformed SSL
  packet.
  (Bug [1582](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1582))

  Versions affected: 0.8.20 to 0.99.5
* The DHCP/BOOTP dissector was susceptible to an off-by-one error.
  (Bug [1416](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1416))

  Versions affected: 0.10.17 to 0.99.5
* Wireshark could loop excessively while reading a malformed MMS
  packet.
  (Bug [1342](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1342))

  Versions affected: 0.10.12 to 0.99.5

The following bugs have been fixed:

* WEP decryption would only work for the first key specified.
  disappear or become unusable. WEP and WPA decryption didn't work
  for QoS frames. WPA decryption failed if EAPOL handshake packets
  contained extra data. Wireshark failed to parse colon-separated
  WEP keys.
* Merging files in Wireshark now appends files properly.
* Wireshark could hang while saving an RTP stream with bad timestamp
  data.
* You must now explicitly pass "--disable-wireshark" to the build
  environment if you only want to build TShark; the configure
  script will fail, rather than automatically building only
  TShark, if it's run on a system that doesn't have GTK+ headers
  and libraries installed.
* Capture from named pipes (via `-i
  \\<server>\pipe\<pipename>`) now works under
  Windows.
* The `frame.time_delta` display filter now works as
  expected, matching the delta time between the current and previous
  *captured* packet. A new filter,
  `frame.time_delta_displayed`,
  matches the delta time between the current and previous
  *displayed* packet.
### New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since the last release:

* You no longer have to restart Wireshark after changing column
  preferences. Woohoo!
* You can now export HTTP objects via File→Export→Objects→HTTP.
* [Display
  filter macros](http://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChDisplayFilterMacrosSection.html) are now supported.
* Right-clicking on a packet lets you copy many more things, such
  as the packet summary and the packet bytes.
* You can now match upper- and lower-case text with the `contains` operator, e.g. `upper(http.request.method) contains "GET"`.
* A great deal of code has been cleaned up, including fixing many
  compiler errors. Many thanks to those who worked on this.

## Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
the [download
page](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html) on the main web site.

### Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages
can be found on the
[download page](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html#otherplat) on the Wireshark web site.

## File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.

## Known Problems

The Filter button is nonfunctional in the
file dialogs under Windows.
([Bug
942](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=942))

            Versions affected: 0.10.12 to 0.99.5

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark or Ethereal crash or use
up available memory by injecting a purposefully malformed packet
onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet
trace file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 0.99.6.

If are running Wireshark 0.99.5 or Ethereal 0.99.0 or earlier and
cannot upgrade, you can work around each of the problems listed above
by doing the following:

* Disable the HTTP, DCP ETSI, SSL, DHCP/BOOTP, and MMS dissectors.
  + Select *Analyze→Enabled Protocols...* from the menu.+ Make sure "HTTP", "DCP (ETSI)", "SSL", "BOOTP/DHCP", and "MMS"
      are un-checked.+ Click "Save", then click "OK".

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
