Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `PtzUrl` property of the Vivotek Motion JPEG Control (MjpegDecoder.dll 2.0.0.13). The vulnerability is triggered when the `PtzUrl` property is assigned an overly long string, causing a buffer overflow on the stack.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow. The application fails to properly validate the length of the input provided to the `PtzUrl` property before copying it to a fixed-size buffer on the stack. This lack of bounds checking allows an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory regions, including the return address, when a long string is passed to the vulnerable property. The exploit specifically notes that the application handles strings in UNICODE, meaning that the overflow occurs in the UNICODE representation of the input string.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** By controlling the overwritten return address, the attacker can redirect the execution flow to arbitrary code, which they provide as part of their exploit. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the targeted system, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control of the compromised machine. In the provided exploit, this is leveraged to add a new user (`sun` with password `tzu`) to the system.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through a web browser, by embedding a malicious ActiveX object on a web page. Additionally, the exploit can be triggered by dragging the HTML file directly into the browser window.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to visit a malicious website or open a crafted HTML file containing the exploit. The attacker must also craft a valid exploit payload, including the shellcode to be executed on the targeted system.
