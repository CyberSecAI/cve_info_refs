- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The login form of Broadcast Machine is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) because it does not properly sanitize user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the username input field in the login form is vulnerable to injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious code that could steal session cookies or perform other actions within the context of the user's session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into the `username` field of the login form via a crafted POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable login form. No special privileges or position is required other than being able to access the login form.
