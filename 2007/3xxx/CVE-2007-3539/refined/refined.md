Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2007-3539

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `qti_ind_member.php` and `qti_usr.php` files of QuickTicket.
- Input passed to the `dir` and `order` parameters in `qti_ind_member.php`, and the `id` parameter in `qti_usr.php`, are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Manipulation:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries.
- **Data Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the database, such as user credentials (as demonstrated in the provided exploit example for `qti_usr.php` which targets the `pwd` column).
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** With sufficient privileges, attackers could potentially modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through the `dir`, `order`, and `id` parameters within HTTP GET requests to vulnerable scripts.
    - `qti_ind_member.php?dir=[SQL Injection]&order=[SQL Injection]`
    - `qti_usr.php?id=[SQL Injection]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote and does not require any special privileges.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters (`dir`, `order`, `id`) and the vulnerable scripts (`qti_ind_member.php` and `qti_usr.php`).

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit example provided for `qti_usr.php` uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to extract data from the `qtiuser` table, specifically targeting the password field.
- The `d0rk` section provides Google dorking search queries that can help identify potentially vulnerable installations.
- Affected versions include at least QuickTicket 1.2 build 20070621, 1.4, and 1.5.
