## What Is It?

*Libarchive* is a programming library that can create and
read several different streaming archive formats, including most
popular tar variants, several cpio formats, and both BSD and GNU
ar variants. It can also write shar archives and read ISO9660
CDROM images and ZIP archives. The *bsdtar* program is an
implementation of tar(1) that is built on top of *libarchive*.
It started as a test harness, but has grown into a feature-competitive
replacement for GNU tar. The *bsdcpio* program is an implementation
of cpio(1) that is built on top of *libarchive*.

The *bsdtar* archiving program is built on libarchive,
so offers a variety of modern features. One unusual feature it
offers is the ability to function as a format-conversion filter,
reading entries from one archive and emitting an archive in a
different format with the same contents. This feature was simple
to implement because libarchive's robust automatic format
detection makes it unnecessary to specify the format of the input
archive. More details are available in the bsdtar documentation.

## Why?

Sometime around 2001, there was a debate on one of the mailing lists
about the FreeBSD package tools. The debate concerned two
interrelated questions:

* What is the "right" format for a package system?* Why are FreeBSD's package tools slower than their
    counterparts on other systems?

After looking into it a bit, I concluded that tar/gzip and tar/bzip2
were fine formats and that the performance problems were purely
implementation issues.

So, I started a project to rewrite the package tools, beginning
with *pkg\_add*. Key to this project is a library that
understands tar/gzip and tar/bzip2 archives.
I finished *libtarfile* in early 2003 and realized that
much of the core infrastructure would easily generalize to
handling other formats, so the library was renamed
*libarchive*.
Once I had built *libarchive*, I realized that my
early test harness was very nearly a complete
BSD-licensed replacement for GNU *tar*, hence *bsdtar*.
The FreeBSD project adopted bsdtar and libarchive and allowed
me to continue development within the FreeBSD source tree.
Around 2007, libarchive was ported to other platforms and
primary development moved to a separate repository, first
on GoogleCode, then on Github where it is today.

Hash: SHA1
=============================================================================
FreeBSD-SA-07:05.libarchive Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: Errors handling corrupt tar files in libarchive(3)
Category: core
Module: libarchive
Announced: 2007-07-12
Credits: CPNI, CERT-FI, Tim Kientzle, Colin Percival
Affects: FreeBSD 5.3 and later.
Corrected: 2007-07-12 15:00:44 UTC (RELENG\_6, 6.2-STABLE)
2007-07-12 15:01:14 UTC (RELENG\_6\_2, 6.2-RELEASE-p6)
2007-07-12 15:01:32 UTC (RELENG\_6\_1, 6.1-RELEASE-p18)

2007-07-12 15:01:56 UTC (RELENG\_5\_5, 5.5-RELEASE-p14)
CVE Name: CVE-2007-3641, CVE-2007-3644, CVE-2007-3645
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The libarchive library provides a flexible interface for reading and
writing streaming archive files such as tar and cpio, and has been the
basis for FreeBSD's implementation of the tar(1) utility since FreeBSD 5.3.
II. Problem Description
Several problems have been found in the code used to parse the tar and
pax interchange formats. These include entering an infinite loop if an
archive prematurely ends within a pax extension header or if certain
types of corruption occur in pax extension headers [CVE-2007-3644];
dereferencing a NULL pointer if an archive prematurely ends within a
tar header immediately following a pax extension header or if certain
other types of corruption occur in pax extension headers [CVE-2007-3645];
and miscomputing the length of a buffer resulting in a buffer overflow
if yet another type of corruption occurs in a pax extension header
[CVE-2007-3641].
III. Impact
An attacker who can cause a corrupt archive of his choice to be parsed
by libarchive, including by having "tar -x" (extract) or "tar -t" (list
entries) run on it, can cause libarchive to enter an infinite loop, to
core dump, or possibly to execute arbitrary code provided by the
attacker.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available, but systems which do not read tar or pax
extension archives provided by untrusted sources are not vulnerable.
Note that while these issues do not affect libarchive's ability to
parse cpio, ISO9660, or zip format archives, libarchive automatically
detects the format of an archive, so external metadata (e.g., a file
name) is not sufficient to ensure that a file will not be parsed using
the vulnerable tar/pax format parser.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to 5-STABLE, or 6-STABLE, or to the
RELENG\_6\_2, RELENG\_6\_1, or RELENG\_5\_5 security branch dated after the
correction date.
2) To patch your present system:
The following patches have been verified to apply to FreeBSD 5.5, 6.1,
and 6.2 systems.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-07:05/libarchive.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-07:05/libarchive.patch.asc
b) Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
# cd /usr/src/lib/libarchive
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
# cd /usr/src/rescue
# make obj && make depend && make && make install
NOTE: On the amd64 platform, the above procedure will not update the
lib32 (i386 compatibility) libraries. On amd64 systems where the i386
compatibility libraries are used, the operating system should instead
be recompiled as described in

# libarchive (formerly named as bsdtar): Multiple PaX Extension Header Vulnerabilities — GLSA **200708-03**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in libarchive (formerly named as
app-archive/bsdtar), possibly allowing for the execution of arbitrary code
or a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-arch/libarchive** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.2.4** |

### Background

libarchive is a library for manipulating different streaming archive
formats, including certain tar variants, several cpio formats, and both
BSD and GNU ar variants.

### Description

CPNI, CERT-FI, Tim Kientzle, and Colin Percival reported a buffer
overflow (CVE-2007-3641), an infinite loop (CVE-2007-3644), and a NULL
pointer dereference (CVE-2007-3645) within the processing of archives

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : libarchive1
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-3641, CVE-2007-3644, CVE-2007-3645
Debian Bug     : 432924

Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in libarchive1,
a single library to read/write tar, cpio, pax, zip, iso9660, archives.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2007-3641

  It was discovered that libarchive1 would miscompute the length of a buffer
  resulting in a buffer overflow if yet another type of corruption occurred
  in a pax extension header.

CVE-2007-3644

  It was discovered that if an archive prematurely ended within a pax
  extension header the libarchive1 library could enter an infinite loop.

CVE-2007-3645

  If an archive prematurely ended within a tar header, immediately following
  a pax extension header, libarchive1 could dereference a NULL pointer.

The old stable distribution (sarge), does not contain this package.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.53-2etch1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libarchive package.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package: libarchive1
Version: 2.2.3-1
Tags: security
Severity: grave

FreeBSD has disclosed several security problems in libarchive:

| Several problems have been found in the code used to parse the tar and
| pax interchange formats.  These include entering an infinite loop if an
| archive prematurely ends within a pax extension header or if certain
| types of corruption occur in pax extension headers [[CVE-2007-3644](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3644)];
| dereferencing a NULL pointer if an archive prematurely ends within a
| tar header immediately following a pax extension header or if certain
| other types of corruption occur in pax extension headers [[CVE-2007-3645](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3645)];
| and miscomputing the length of a buffer resulting in a buffer overflow
| if yet another type of corruption occurs in a pax extension header
| [[CVE-2007-3641](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3641)].

Please mention the CVE names when fixing these bugs.

I will upload a fix to unstable shortly.  However, it sounds like this could
also impact the version in stable, so CCing security@debian.org.

  Yes that looks to be the case.

  If you had a patch that would apply to the version in Stable that
 would be appreciated.  I applied the FreeBSd patch but that failed
 more than it succeeded ..

  I'll have a few hours tomorrow to look at it, so don't worry too
 much if you can't supply it.

I'm afraid I don't have anything other than that same FreeBSD patch, and am
going to be pretty much tied up until next week.  Thanks for your help,
Steve.
