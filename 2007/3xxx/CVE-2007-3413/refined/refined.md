- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Input passed to the "GridSearch", "gsearch", and "ParentID" parameters is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary HTML and script code can be executed in a user's browser session in the context of the affected site.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious input passed through the "GridSearch", "gsearch", and "ParentID" parameters in HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can inject malicious code through the vulnerable parameters, which is then executed in the browser of users accessing the affected site.
