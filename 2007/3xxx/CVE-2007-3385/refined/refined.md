Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2007-3385:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The content from multiple sources (IBM, OpenSUSE, Apache Tomcat, CERT) explicitly mentions CVE-2007-3385 and describes it as a vulnerability related to improper handling of characters within cookies by Apache Tomcat. Therefore, the content is relevant to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The root cause of the vulnerability is the incorrect handling of the character sequence `\"` (backslash followed by double quote) within cookie values by Apache Tomcat. The server was not properly escaping/handling this sequence, leading to misinterpretation during cookie parsing.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - **Improper Input Handling:** Tomcat's cookie parsing mechanism was flawed, failing to correctly interpret backslash followed by double quote within a cookie value.
   - **Cookie Parsing Vulnerability:** The core issue was how Tomcat was parsing cookies, particularly when certain special characters were present.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **Session Hijacking (Information Disclosure):** A primary impact was the possibility of session hijacking, where an attacker could potentially obtain sensitive information, such as session IDs from other users, which could then be used to gain unauthorized access. This is due to the misinterpretation during cookie parsing.
   - In some circumstances it could leak information such as session ID to an attacker.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - **Manipulated HTTP Cookies:** The primary attack vector involved sending an HTTP request to a vulnerable server with a cookie containing the specially crafted `\"` sequence. This could be achieved through various means such as crafted links, cross site scripting, or through attacker-controlled clients.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable Tomcat server. This could be from a remote location over the network, or from a local machine, depending on the application architecture.
   - **Ability to craft HTTP cookies:** The attacker needs the ability to create and send a crafted cookie value. This might involve other vulnerabilities, such as XSS, to inject the cookie into a user's browser.

**Additional Details from the Content**

   - **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affected multiple versions of Apache Tomcat, including versions 6.0.0 to 6.0.13.
   - **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by correcting how Tomcat handles the specific character sequence during cookie parsing. Patches were included in later versions, such as Apache Tomcat 6.0.14.
   - **Severity:** The vulnerability was considered to be of "low" or "moderate" severity, requiring specific conditions to be exploitable.
   - **Mitigation:** Upgrading to a patched version of Tomcat is the most effective way to address this vulnerability. In some cases, mitigation was possible by validating user-provided data in HTTP headers and ensuring that cookies did not contain single quotes.
    - IBM states that the exposures listed are low priority due to the fact that it requires Administrative authority on the IMS server to exploit.

**Summary of extracted information:**
- **Root cause:** Incorrect handling of the `\"` sequence in HTTP cookie values.
- **Vulnerability:** Cookie parsing mechanism flaw.
- **Impact:** Information disclosure via session hijacking.
- **Attack vector:** Maliciously crafted HTTP cookies.
- **Attacker position:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests with crafted cookies.
- **Affected versions**: 6.0.0 to 6.0.13.
- **Fix:** Patched versions of Apache Tomcat 6.0.14 and above.
