Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw present in the `SearchResults.asp` page of the "Image Racer" application by Junction Quest.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input within the `SearchWord` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database query. This is a classic example of a CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact (Partial):** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data from the database, such as usernames and passwords, as shown in the example exploit.
- **Integrity Impact (Partial):** By injecting SQL commands, attackers could modify or delete data stored in the database.
- **Availability Impact (Partial):** The database could be disrupted through SQL injection, potentially leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through HTTP requests to the vulnerable `SearchResults.asp` page.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attack vector involves manipulating the `SearchWord` URL parameter by injecting SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests, typically via a web browser or a similar tool.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs basic SQL knowledge to construct effective injection payloads.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided example `Example : -1 'union select username,password from admin where [FIND IT YOUR SELF]=1` demonstrates how an attacker can extract usernames and passwords from the 'admin' table.
- The vulnerability is rated as a "Medium" risk with a CVSS base score of 7.5/10, according to securityreason.com.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by the Aria-Security Team.
