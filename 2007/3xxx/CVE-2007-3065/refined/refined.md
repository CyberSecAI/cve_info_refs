  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_d7a49963_20250124_140522.html",
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `editcomment` parameter of `viewimage.php` before using it in an SQL query.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection",
        "Lack of proper input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data disclosure, modification, or deletion, as well as potential complete compromise of the database server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request",
         "Manipulation of the `editcomment` parameter in the `viewimage.php` script"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application and have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.  The provided exploit also registers a new user and uses that user's credentials to perform the exploit. No elevated permissions are needed initially."
