The provided content details multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Interact 2.4 beta 1, and potentially other versions.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it's displayed back to the user in various parameters within the application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present. Specifically, the following parameters are vulnerable:
*   `module_key` parameter in `modules/kb/kb.php`, `modules/quiz/runquiz.php`, `modules/quiz/quiz.php`, `modules/forum/forum.php`, `modules/forum/byname.php`, and `modules/journal/journalview.php`
*   `tag_key` parameter in `modules/journal/journalview.php`
*   `user_group_key` parameter in `users/secureaccounts.php`
*   `request_uri` parameter in `login.php`

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser session, in the context of the vulnerable website. This could allow an attacker to:
*   Steal cookies
*   Impersonate users
*   Redirect users to malicious sites
*   Modify the content of the web page

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting malicious URLs containing the vulnerable parameters with embedded XSS payloads. The attacker then needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious URL (e.g., through social engineering or by injecting the link into another site).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with XSS payloads and have the ability to trick a user into accessing those URLs. No special system access is required besides a basic web browser.

The information provided is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing specific vulnerable parameters and file paths, along with the version of the application tested.
