{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Apache HTTP server did not properly verify process IDs before sending signals, allowing a local attacker to send signals to arbitrary processes.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper verification of process IDs",
    "Lack of input sanitization or validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local attacker can cause arbitrary processes to be terminated, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access with the ability to run scripts on the HTTP server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the server with the ability to run scripts (e.g., PHP, CGI)."
