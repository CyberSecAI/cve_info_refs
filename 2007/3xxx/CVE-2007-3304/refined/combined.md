# Apache HTTP Server 2.0 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.0. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.0 has had no new releases since 2013 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before August 2013. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.0 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.0.65

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### moderate: mod\_proxy reverse proxy exposure ([CVE-2011-3368](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3368))

An exposure was found when using mod\_proxy in reverse proxy mode. In certain configurations using RewriteRule with proxy flag or ProxyPassMatch, a remote attacker could cause the reverse proxy to connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information from internal web servers not directly accessible to attacker. No update of 1.3 will be released.

### low: APR apr\_palloc heap overflow ([CVE-2009-2412](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-2412))

A flaw in apr\_palloc() in the bundled copy of APR could cause heap overflows in programs that try to apr\_palloc() a user controlled size. The Apache HTTP Server itself does not pass unsanitized user-provided sizes to this function, so it could only be triggered through some other application which uses apr\_palloc() in a vulnerable way.

### low: expat DoS ([CVE-2009-3720](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2009-3720))

A buffer over-read flaw was found in the bundled expat library. An attacker who is able to get Apache to parse an untrused XML document (for example through mod\_dav) may be able to cause a crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM.

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Brett Gervasoni of Sense of Security for reporting and proposing a patch fix for this issue.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

In this case ignore s-maxage, max-age, min-fresh. For max-stale   it is valid to set no value. In this case set max-stale to 1 year   to signal that the client is accepting a stale response of any age.

# Apache: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200711-06**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Apache, possibly resulting
in a Denial of Service or the disclosure of sensitive information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/apache** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.2.6** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **2.0.59-r5**>= **2.2.6** |

### Background

The Apache HTTP server is one of the most popular web servers on the
Internet.

### Description

Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
mod\_status and mod\_autoindex (CVE-2006-5752, CVE-2007-4465). An error
has been discovered in the recall\_headers() function in mod\_mem\_cache
(CVE-2007-1862). The mod\_cache module does not properly sanitize
requests before processing them (CVE-2007-1863). The Prefork module
does not properly check PID values before sending signals
(CVE-2007-3304). The mod\_proxy module does not correctly check headers
before processing them (CVE-2007-3847).

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit one of these vulnerabilities to inject
arbitrary script or HTML content, obtain sensitive information or cause
a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Apache users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/apache-2.0.59-r5"
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=245111#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-06-21 07:47:16 UTC  ``` "Apache httpd 1.3.37, and 2.0.59 and 2.2.4 with the Prefork MPM module, allows local users to cause a denial of service by modifying the worker_score and process_score arrays to reference an arbitrary process ID, which is sent a SIGUSR1 signal from the master process, "SIGUSR1 killer.""  Fixed upstream by <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=547987>  Note that you'd need to have given local users the ability to run scripts (such as php, cgi) in order for them to kill arbitrary processes.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=245111#c3)  Mark J.

# RHSA-2007:0556 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0556)

## Topic

Updated Apache httpd packages that correct three security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server.

The Apache HTTP Server did not verify that a process was an Apache child
process before sending it signals. A local attacker with the ability to run
scripts on the Apache HTTP Server could manipulate the scoreboard and cause
arbitrary processes to be terminated which could lead to a denial of
service (CVE-2007-3304). This issue is not exploitable on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 if using the default SELinux targeted policy.

A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod\_status module. On sites
where the server-status page is publicly accessible and ExtendedStatus is
enabled this could lead to a cross-site scripting attack. On Red Hat
Enterprise Linux the server-status page is not enabled by default and it is
best practice to not make this publicly available. (CVE-2006-5752)

A bug was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod\_cache module. On sites where
caching is enabled, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted
request that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to
crash. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded
Multi-Processing Module. (CVE-2007-1863)

Users of httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. Users should restart Apache
after installing this update.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

| [Description](#c0)  Sune Kloppenborg Jeppesen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-07-22 12:38:15 UTC  ``` Not sure we're affected by these ones either.  CVE-2006-5752  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mod_status.c in the mod_status module in Apache HTTP Server (httpd), when ExtendedStatus is enabled and a public server-status page is used, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors involving charsets with browsers that perform "charset detection" when the content-type is not specified.  CVE-2007-1863  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mod_status.c in the mod_status module in Apache HTTP Server (httpd), when ExtendedStatus is enabled and a public server-status page is used, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors involving charsets with browsers that perform "charset detection" when the content-type is not specified. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Rajiv Aaron Manglani (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-05 04:11:42 UTC  ``` moderate: mod_status cross-site scripting CVE-2006-5752 Affects: 2.0.59, 2.0.58, 2.0.55, 2.0.54, 2.0.53, 2.0.52, 2.0.51, 2.0.50, 2.0.49, 2.0.48, 2.0.47, 2.0.46, 2.0.45, 2.0.44, 2.0.43, 2.0.42, 2.0.40, 2.0.39, 2.0.37, 2.0.36, 2.0.35 Fixed in Apache httpd 2.0.61-dev patched in apache-2.2.4-r12 or earlier   moderate: mod_cache proxy DoS CVE-2007-1863 Affects: 2.2.4, 2.2.3, 2.2.2, 2.2.0 Fixed in Apache httpd 2.2.6-dev patched in apache-2.2.4-r12 or earlier   didn't check the 2.0.x branch.    however apache-2.2.4-r12 need a patch for  moderate: mod_proxy crash CVE-2007-3847 A flaw was found in the Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy module. On sites where a reverse proxy is configured, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request that would cause the Apache child process handling that request to crash. On sites where a forward proxy is configured, an attacker could cause a similar crash if a user could be persuaded to visit a malicious site using the proxy. This could lead to a denial of service if using a threaded Multi-Processing Module.  <http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_22.html>   ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-07 14:58:39 UTC  ``` there's also [bug 191603](show_bug.cgi?id=191603 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - www-servers/apache: Security-relevant updates"), and I have to admit I'm a bit lost with all this issues and versions. Apache, please advise on what needs to be done to fix this, and maybe close the other bug if it's not necessary. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Benedikt Böhm (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-07 21:47:56 UTC  ``` all CVEs have been backported to 2.0.59-r5/2.2.4-r12, except 2007-3847 is missing in 2.2.4-r12, but fixed with 2.2.6, which is now in cvs, see also #187258 ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-08 11:37:16 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 191603](show_bug.cgi?id=191603 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - www-servers/apache: Security-relevant updates") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-08 11:45:07 UTC  ``` ok thanks for the info. So in the end, how do you want to proceed with stabilization? In any case seems that we'll have to call arches for 2.2.6 as a fix is missing with 2.2.4-r12, but should we call all arches for 2.0.61 or just the ones that don't have 2.0.59-r5? please advise. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Benedikt Böhm (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-08 15:29:52 UTC  ``` 2.0.59-r5 is ok, but 2.2.6 should be stabilized asap for CVE-2007-3847 ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Pierre-Yves Rofes (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-09-08 15:39:15 UTC  ``` ok.

httpd security update (RHSA-2007-0662)

Original Release Date: August 23, 2007

Last Revised: June 23, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-363

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 5.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Apache HTTP Server (httpd) is a free, open-source Web server
available
from the Apache Foundation.

A vulnerability has been reported in the way httpd signals child
processes. A
local attacker could execute a malicious script and potentially cause
arbitrary
processes to be terminated, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2007-3304](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3304) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0662.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with httpd installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Communication Manager | CM 2.x, 3.x, 4.x | Low | Upgrade to CM 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya Intuity LX | All | Low | Customers should upgrade to IALX 2.0 SP2. |
| Avaya EMMC | All | Low | Will not be addressed since no further releases of EMMC are planned. |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 4.0 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to MSS 5.0 to resolve this issue |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |
| Avaya CCS/SES | SES 4.0 and earlier | Low | Upgrade to SES 5.0 or later. |
| Avaya AES | AES 3.1.3 and earlier, 4.0 thru 4.2.1 | Low | For AES 3.1.3 and earlier upgrade to AES 3.1.4 or later.  For AES 4.0 thru 4.2.1 upgrade to AES 4.2.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable versions of
httpd, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is
installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied
by RedHat Linux.

## 5. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

# USN-499-1: Apache vulnerabilities

17 August 2007

Apache vulnerabilities

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 7.04](/security/notices?release=feisty)
* [Ubuntu 6.10](/security/notices?release=edgy)
* [Ubuntu 6.06](/security/notices?release=dapper)

## Details

Stefan Esser discovered that mod\_status did not force a character set,

which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to XSS attacks when

processing the output. If a user were tricked into viewing server

status output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could

exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as

passwords), within the same domain. By default, mod\_status is disabled

in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2006-5752](/security/CVE-2006-5752))

Niklas Edmundsson discovered that the mod\_cache module could be made to

crash using a specially crafted request. A remote user could use this

to cause a denial of service if Apache was configured to use a threaded

worker. By default, mod\_cache is disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-1863](/security/CVE-2007-1863))

A flaw was discovered in the signal handling of Apache. A local

attacker could trick Apache into sending SIGUSR1 to other processes.

The vulnerable code was only present in Ubuntu Feisty. ([CVE-2007-3304](/security/CVE-2007-3304))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 7.04

* apache2-mpm-worker
  -
  2.2.3-3.2ubuntu0.1
* apache2.2-common
  -
  2.2.3-3.2ubuntu0.1
* apache2-mpm-prefork
  -
  2.2.3-3.2ubuntu0.1

##### Ubuntu 6.10

* apache2-mpm-worker
  -
  2.0.55-4ubuntu4.1
* apache2-common
  -
  2.0.55-4ubuntu4.1
* apache2-mpm-prefork
  -
  2.0.55-4ubuntu4.1

##### Ubuntu 6.06

* apache2-mpm-worker
  -
  2.0.55-4ubuntu2.2
* apache2-common
  -
  2.0.55-4ubuntu2.2
* apache2-mpm-prefork
  -
  2.0.55-4ubuntu2.2

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the

necessary changes.

# Apache HTTP Server 1.3 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 1.3. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 1.3 has had no new releases since 2010 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before March 2010. Subsequent issues may have affected 1.3 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.42

### important: mod\_rewrite off-by-one error ([CVE-2006-3747](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-3747))

An off-by-one flaw exists in the Rewrite module, mod\_rewrite. Depending on the manner in which Apache httpd was compiled, this software defect may result in a vulnerability which, in combination with certain types of Rewrite rules in the web server configuration files, could be triggered remotely. For vulnerable builds, the nature of the vulnerability can be denial of service (crashing of web server processes) or potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### moderate: Expect header Cross-Site Scripting ([CVE-2006-3918](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2006-3918))

A flaw in the handling of invalid Expect headers. If an attacker can influence the Expect header that a victim sends to a target site they could perform a cross-site scripting attack. It is known that some versions of Flash can set an arbitrary Expect header which can trigger this flaw. Not marked as a security issue for 2.0 or 2.2 as the cross-site scripting is only returned to the victim after the server times out a connection.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.32

### moderate: mod\_proxy buffer overflow ([CVE-2004-0492](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0492))

A buffer overflow was found in the Apache proxy module, mod\_proxy, which can be triggered by receiving an invalid Content-Length header. In order to exploit this issue an attacker would need to get an Apache installation that was configured as a proxy to connect to a malicious site. This would cause the Apache child processing the request to crash, although this does not represent a significant Denial of Service attack as requests will continue to be handled by other Apache child processes. This issue may lead to remote arbitrary code execution on some BSD platforms.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 1.3.31

### low: Error log escape filtering ([CVE-2003-0020](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0020))

Apache does not filter terminal escape sequences from error logs, which could make it easier for attackers to insert those sequences into terminal emulators containing vulnerabilities related to escape sequences.

### low: mod\_digest nonce checking ([CVE-2003-0987](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2003-0987))

mod\_digest does not properly verify the nonce of a client response by using a AuthNonce secret. This could allow a malicious user who is able to sniff network traffic to conduct a replay attack against a website using Digest protection. Note that mod\_digest implements an older version of the MD5 Digest Authentication specification which is known not to work with modern browsers. This issue does not affect mod\_auth\_digest.

### important: listening socket starvation ([CVE-2004-0174](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2004-0174))

A starvation issue on listening sockets occurs when a short-lived connection on a rarely-accessed listening socket will cause a child to hold the accept mutex and block out new connections until another connection arrives on that rarely-accessed listening socket. This issue is known to affect some versions of AIX, Solaris, and Tru64; it is known to not affect FreeBSD or Linux.

### important: Multiple header Denial of Service vulnerability ([CVE-1999-1199](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-1999-1199))

A serious problem exists when a client sends a large number of headers with the same header name. Apache uses up memory faster than the amount of memory required to simply store the received data itself. That is, memory use increases faster and faster as more headers are received, rather than increasing at a constant rate. This makes a denial of service attack based on this method more effective than methods which cause Apache to use memory at a constant rate, since the attacker has to send less data.

# Apache HTTP Server 2.2 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.2. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.2 is End-of-Life since December 2017 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before the End-of-Life. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.2 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.35-never

### low: Use-after-free when using <Limit > with an unrecognized method in .htaccess ("OptionsBleed") ([CVE-2017-9798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9798))

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### important: Timeout detection flaw (mod\_proxy\_http) ([CVE-2010-2068](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2068))

An information disclosure flaw was found in mod\_proxy\_http in versions 2.2.9 through 2.2.15, 2.3.4-alpha and 2.3.5-alpha. Under certain timeout conditions, the server could return a response intended for another user. Only Windows, Netware and OS2 operating systems are affected. Only those configurations which trigger the use of proxy worker pools are affected. There was no vulnerability on earlier versions, as proxy pools were not yet introduced.

The simplest workaround is to globally configure;

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

# Understanding IT security

Published March 19, 2018 •%t-minute readCopy URL

Information technology (IT) security, commonly referred to as cybersecurity, includes network security, internet security, endpoint security, API security, cloud security, application security, container security, and more. It's about establishing a set of IT security systems, solutions and strategies that work together to help protect your digital data.

Not so long ago, IT security was a checkpoint at the end of a software development cycle. It was slow. Businesses today are looking for ways to create integrated IT security programs so that they can adapt faster and more efficiently to security threats. Think of it as security that is built in, rather than bolted on.

### Boost hybrid cloud security

[Get the e-book](/en/engage/boost-hybrid-cloud-security "SOLP: Hybrid Cloud Security ebook")

## What is IT security?

IT security protects the integrity of information technologies like computer systems, networks, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. A business trying to compete in a world of [digital transformation](/en/topics/digital-transformation) needs to understand how to adopt information security solutions that begin with design. This is what it means to "shift security left"—to make security a part of the infrastructure and product lifecycle as early as possible. This helps security be both proactive and reactive.

Continuous security is fed by a routine system of feedback and adaptation, often handled through the use of automatic checkpoints. [Automation](/en/topics/automation/what-is-security-automation) ensures fast and effective feedback that doesn’t slow the product lifecycle down. Integrating network security in this way also means that updates and incident responses can be implemented quickly and holistically as the security landscape changes.

[Learn more about security automation](/en/topics/automation/what-is-security-automation "article | what is security automation")
## Why is cybersecurity important for business?

Traditionally, IT and cybersecurity was focused on fortifying, maintaining, and policing the datacenter perimeter—but today that perimeter is dissolving. The way we develop, deploy, integrate, and manage IT  is dramatically changing. Public and hybrid clouds are redistributing responsibility for regulatory compliance and data security across multiple vendors. The adoption of containers at scale requires new methods of analyzing, securing, and updating the delivery of applications. Mobile apps are spread across a multitude of devices, and more and more infrastructure is moving from hardware to software. More complicated networks of devices or processes can increase the risk of security compromises, like insider threats or malware.

The traditional ways of managing security aren’t keeping up. Digital transformation demands a change in IT security services and programs—security must be continuous, integrated, and flexible in a digital world.

For some businesses, doing security right means hiring a Business Information Security Officer. BISOs are embedded in the business and involved in the product lifecycle from design to delivery and adoption. Often alongside security analysts, they report to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to make sure that security initiatives and concerns are thoughtfully managed and integrated at every stage, balancing security needs with risk to the business to ensure fast delivery that functions as it should.

## What is Linux security?

[Security-Enhanced Linux](/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux) (SELinux) is a security architecture for Linux® systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the information system. It was originally developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as a series of patches to the Linux kernel using Linux Security Modules (LSM).

SELinux was released to the open source community in 2000, and was integrated into the upstream Linux kernel in 2003.

Manage security and compliance risk on open source Linux

[Get the e-book](/en/engage/manage-security-compliance-s-202010120658 "SOLP: Manage security and compliance risk on open source Linux")

## What is Zero Trust IT security?

[Zero Trust](/en/topics/security/what-is-zero-trust) is an approach to designing network security architectures based on the premise that every interaction begins in an untrusted state. This contrasts with traditional architectures which may determine trustworthiness based on whether communication starts inside a firewall. More specifically, Zero Trust attempts to close gaps in security architectures that rely on implicit trust models and one-time authentication.

Zero Trust architecture has gained popularity because the global cybersecurity threat landscape has evolved, challenging long held assumptions about the inherent trustworthiness of activities inside a network. Well-organized cybercriminals can recruit insiders, and continue to find new ways past the outer shell of traditional security architectures. Sophisticated hackers and commercialized ransomware-as-a-service platforms have also become more widely available, making it easier for new kinds of financially-motivated cybercrime to occur. All of these cyberthreats have the potential to exfiltrate valuable data, disrupt business and commerce, and impact day-to-day life.

[Learn about Zero Trust](/en/topics/security/what-is-zero-trust "article | what is zero trust?")
## What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps is the combination of [DevOps](/en/topics/devops) practices and security strategies as a means for organizations to increase IT security and reduce risk to their software environments. DevSecOps can enable an organization to secure their software environments faster, at larger scale, and more comprehensively when compared to traditional IT security strategies.

[Learn more about DevSecOps](/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops "article | what is DevSecOps?")
## What is container security?

Containers make it easy to [build, package, and promote an application or service](/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-containerization) across different environments and deployment targets. But there are some challenges to container security. As more businesses adopt container technologies, security teams have new adversary models to combat and new infrastructure components to secure.

Static security policies and checklists don’t scale for containers in the enterprise. The supply chain needs more security policy services. Teams need to balance the networking and governance needs of containers. A successful organizational container security program must implement key controls throughout the build, deploy, and run phases of the container life cycle as well as in the underlying container infrastructure.

[Learn more about container security](/en/topics/security/container-security "article | what is container security?")
## What is cloud security?

While many people understand the benefits of [cloud services](/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-are-cloud-services), they’re equally deterred by the security threats. We get it. It’s hard to wrap your head around something that exists somewhere between amorphous resources sent through the internet and a physical server. It’s a dynamic environment where things are always changing—like security threats.

While the adoption of cloud-native technologies creates new security challenges, it also creates opportunities to enhance existing security strategies. The goals of an effective cloud-native security strategy should allow teams to achieve greater levels of software delivery while building more secure systems.

[Learn about cloud security](/en/topics/security/cloud-security-1 "article | what is different about cloud security?")
## What is hybrid cloud security?

[Hybrid cloud environments](/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-hybrid-cloud) offer users a lot of choice and flexibility. You can keep critical or sensitive information off the public cloud while still taking advantage of cloud providers for data that doesn’t have the same kinds of risk associated with it. Here are some of the challenges of [hybrid cloud security](/en/topics/security/what-is-hybrid-cloud-security), and the tools you need to solve them.

## What is API security?

You probably don’t keep your savings under your mattress. Most people keep their money in a trusted environment (the bank) and use separate methods to authorize and authenticate payments. [API security is similar](/en/topics/security/api-security). You need a trusted environment with policies for authentication and authorization.

API security best practices include the use of tokens, encryption and signatures, quotas and throttling, and an API gateway. Most importantly, though, API security relies on good [API management](/en/topics/api/what-is-api-management).

[Learn about API security](/en/topics/security/api-security "article | what is API security?")
## What is malware?

Malware, short for malicious software, is any software that acts against the interest of the user. From ransomware to adware to botnets, malware is responsible for destroying data, violating people's privacy, and causing countless hours of lost productivity. Malware—sometimes delivered via phishing scams—can affect not only the infected computer, laptop or device but potentially any other device the infected device can communicate with. Malware attacks are a severe threat, but effective IT security can reduce your organization’s vulnerabilities and exposure to cyberattacks.

[Learn about malware](/en/topics/security/what-is-malware "article | what is malware?")
## What is Kubernetes security?

Kubernetes (also known as k8s or "kube") is an [open source container orchestration platform](/en/topics/containers/what-is-kubernetes) that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications. IT security teams need to understand Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies sufficiently to establish effective preventative measures and risk management.

[Kubernetes-native security](/en/topics/containers/advantages-of-kubernetes-native-security) provides deeper insight, faster analysis, and simpler operations, reducing the overall investment in time, effort, and personnel required to implement security.

[Get the whitepaper](/en/engage/state-kubernetes-security-s-202106210910 "SOLP : State of Kubernetes Security Report")
## What is CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)?

CVE, short for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, is a [list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws](/en/topics/security/what-is-cve). CVE is also shorthand for the CVE ID number assigned to a security flaw. CVEs help IT professionals coordinate their efforts to prioritize and address these vulnerabilities to make computer networks more secure.

[Learn about CVE](/en/topics/security/what-is-cve "article | what is cve")
## What is vulnerability management?

Vulnerability management is an IT security practice that involves identifying, assessing, and remediating security flaws in devices, networks, and applications, in order to reduce the risks of cyberattacks and security breaches. A vulnerability management program helps security teams automate their detection and remediation processes, including vulnerability scanning and patching.

[Learn about vulnerability management](/en/topics/security/what-is-vulnerability-management)
## What is Red Hat's approach to hybrid cloud security?

![](/rhdc/managed-files/styles/wysiwyg_float/private/security-guide-circular.png.webp?itok=uSmhqfQ1)

Containers and hybrid cloud technologies have made the security landscape much more complex. Security teams are increasingly finding it challenging to keep up with the changing risks, compliance requirements, tools, and architectural changes introduced by these technologies. Traditional perimeter-based network security is no longer effective on its own, and security teams must rethink their approach.

Red Hat’s layered, defense-in-depth security as code approach helps customers implement security across the entire infrastructure and application stack and life cycle.

# RHSA-2007:0662 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2007%3A0662)

## Topic

Updated Apache httpd packages that correct a security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.

This update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red
Hat Security Response Team.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular Web server.

The Apache HTTP Server did not verify that a process was an Apache child
process before sending it signals. A local attacker with the ability to run
scripts on the Apache HTTP Server could manipulate the scoreboard and cause
arbitrary processes to be terminated which could lead to a denial of
service. (CVE-2007-3304).

Users of httpd should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct this issue. Users should restart Apache
after installing this update.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure that all previously-released
errata relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via Red Hat Network. Details on how to use
the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<http://kbase.redhat.com/faq/FAQ_58_10188>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=245111#c0)  Mark J. Cox    2007-06-21 07:47:16 UTC  ``` "Apache httpd 1.3.37, and 2.0.59 and 2.2.4 with the Prefork MPM module, allows local users to cause a denial of service by modifying the worker_score and process_score arrays to reference an arbitrary process ID, which is sent a SIGUSR1 signal from the master process, "SIGUSR1 killer.""  Fixed upstream by <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=547987>  Note that you'd need to have given local users the ability to run scripts (such as php, cgi) in order for them to kill arbitrary processes.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=245111#c3)  Mark J.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

httpd security update (RHSA-2007-0557)

Original Release Date: August 15, 2007

Last Revised: January 15, 2009

Number: ASA-2007-353

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Interim

---

## 1. Overview:

The Apache HTTP Server (httpd) is a free, open-source Web server
available from the Apache Foundation.

A vulnerability has been reported in the httpd mod\_status module. In
certain configurations, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to
execute
a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2006-5752](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5752) to this issue.

A vulnerability has been found in the httpd mod\_cache module. In
certain
configurations, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request
which
could cause the Apache child process handling the request to crash,
potentially
leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2007-1863](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1863) to this issue.

A vulnerability has been reported in the way httpd signals child
processes.
A local attacker could execute a malicious script and potentially cause
arbitrary
processes to be terminated, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name
[CVE-2007-3304](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3304) to this issue..

This advisory only reflects the version of Apache HTTP Server (httpd)
shipped with
the Red Hat Application Stack, which is not the same as the versions
shipped with
Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the
security advisory issued by RedHat Linux:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2007-0557.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products with vulnerable versions of httpd installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Messaging Storage Server | MSS 4.0 and earlier. | Low | Upgrade to MSS 5.0 to resolve this issue. |
| Avaya Message Networking | All | Low | See recommended actions below.  This issue will be addressed in accordance with [Avaya's Product Security Vulnerability Response Policy](http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/security_vulnerability_response.pdf) |

**Recommended Actions:**
For all system products which use
vulnerable versions of
httpd, Avaya recommends that customers restrict local
and network access to the server. This restriction should be
enforced through the use of physical security, firewalls, ACLs,
VPNs, and other generally-accepted networking practices until such
time as an update becomes available and can be installed.

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating
systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying
operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities
often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity
of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not
affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be.
Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and
then follow
that vendor's guidance.

## 4. Software-Only Products:

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. The CVLAN application does not require the software described in this advisory. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. The IMS application does not require the software described in this advisory. |

**Recommended Actions:**
In the event that the affected package
is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions
supplied by RedHat Linux.
