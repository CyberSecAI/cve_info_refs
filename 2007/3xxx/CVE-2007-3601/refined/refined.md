The provided content relates to a bug in vtiger CRM calendar security (ticket #3990), not a security vulnerability. The issue is that in a migrated build of vtiger CRM, non-admin users could see the calendar activities of admin users even though calendar activities are set as private by default. When non-admin user attempts to view the activity, they get "you are not permitted to execute this operation" message, but the activity is visible nonetheless. This behavior is not observed in normal builds.

The issue appears to stem from the "migrated build" and not a weakness in the permission model itself.
The ticket was closed and marked as fixed within a day, indicating that this issue was resolved quickly.

The content does not contain any information about the root cause, attack vectors, or attacker capabilities required to exploit this issue, and it does not describe a security vulnerability.
