# Asterisk: Multiple vulnerabilities â€” GLSA **200802-11**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Asterisk.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/asterisk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.21.1-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | revision >= **1.2.17-r1**>= **1.2.21.1-r1** |

### Background

Asterisk is an open source telephony engine and tool kit.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Asterisk:

* Russel Bryant reported a stack buffer overflow in the IAX2 channel
  driver (chan\_iax2) when bridging calls between chan\_iax2 and any
  channel driver that uses RTP for media (CVE-2007-3762).
* Chris
  Clark and Zane Lackey (iSEC Partners) reported a NULL pointer
  dereference in the IAX2 channel driver (chan\_iax2)
  (CVE-2007-3763).
* Will Drewry (Google Security) reported a
  vulnerability in the Skinny channel driver (chan\_skinny), resulting in
  an overly large memcpy (CVE-2007-3764).
* Will Drewry (Google
  Security) reported a vulnerability in the IAX2 channel driver
  (chan\_iax2), that does not correctly handle unauthenticated
  transactions using a 3-way handshake (CVE-2007-4103).

### Impact

By sending a long voice or video RTP frame, a remote attacker could
possibly execute arbitrary code on the target machine. Sending
specially crafted LAGRQ or LAGRP frames containing information elements
of IAX frames, or a certain data length value in a crafted packet, or
performing a flood of calls not completing a 3-way handshake, could
result in a Denial of Service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Asterisk users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/asterisk-1.2.17-r1"
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

These releases contain fixes for four critical security vulnerabilities.  One of these vulnerabilities is a remotely exploitable stack buffer overflow, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine.  The other three are all remotely exploitable crash vulnerabilities.  We have released Asterisk Security Advisories for each of the vulnerabilities.  The current version of each advisory can be downloaded from the ftp site.  <http://ftp.digium.com/pub/asa/ASA-2007-014.pdf>  * Affected systems include those that bridge calls between chan_iax2 and any channel driver that uses RTP for media  <http://ftp.digium.com/pub/asa/ASA-2007-015.pdf>  * Affected systems include any system that has chan_iax2 enabled  <http://ftp.digium.com/pub/asa/ASA-2007-016.pdf>  * Affected systems include any system that has chan_skinny enabled  <http://ftp.digium.com/pub/asa/ASA-2007-017.pdf>  * Affected systems include any 1.4 system that has any channel driver that uses RTP for media enabled  All users that have systems that meet any of the criteria listed above should upgrade as soon as possible.  Thank you very much for your support. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Rajiv Aaron Manglani (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2007-07-24 23:37:43 UTC  ``` another release: <http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-announce/2007-July/000084.html>  The Asterisk development team has released Asterisk versions 1.2.23 and 1.4.9.  These releases contain bug fixes, including one for a security vulnerability. The vulnerability is a potential Denial of Service attack when the Asterisk IAX2 channel driver is configured to allow unauthenticated calls.  We have released an Asterisk Security Advisory for the vulnerability.  The  current version of the advisory can be downloaded from the ftp site.  <http://ftp.digium.com/pub/asa/ASA-2007-018.pdf>  * Affected systems include all Asterisk installations running an affected version that allow unauthenticated IAX2 calls.  Affected open source versions include 1.2.20 through 1.2.22, and 1.4.5 through 1.4.8.  All users that have systems that meet the criteria listed above should  upgrade as soon as possible.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
