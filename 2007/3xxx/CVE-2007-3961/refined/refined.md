Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to boundary errors in the `fsplib` code used by gFTP. Specifically, the code does not properly handle overly long directory or file names when processing them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fsplib` library when processing long directory or file names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). Specifically, a remote attacker could entice a user to download a file with a specially crafted directory or file name, triggering the overflow and causing a crash or malfunction in the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The attack vector involves enticing a user to download a file from a malicious server. This file would have a directory or filename crafted to exceed the buffer limitations, causing the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious server that the victim's gFTP client connects to.
- The attacker needs to be able to create specially crafted directory or file names that are long enough to cause a buffer overflow.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `fsplib` library code, which is used by gFTP. This library is responsible for handling file and directory operations, and its flaw in handling long names is the root of the issue.
- The fix involves updating the `fsplib` library to versions 0.8 or 0.9 which address the boundary errors and off-by-one errors that caused the vulnerability. The fix involves:
    - Checking if a server sends ASCIIZ terminated filenames.
    - Adding a terminating null byte if the directory entry is of maximum length.
    - Fixing a possible buffer overflow on systems not defining `dirent.d_name` long enough.
- The affected versions of gFTP are those prior to 2.0.18-r6.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- This CVE is related to CVE-2007-3962, which is a buffer overflow that can lead to arbitrary code execution. This CVE (CVE-2007-3961) only leads to a denial of service.
