- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` and `type` parameters within the `index.php` file. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion, or other unauthorized database access.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface by manipulating the `id` and `type` parameters in the `index.php` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable phpRaider application and manipulate the `id` and `type` parameters in the request.
