Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2007-3653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the Fa Name version 1.0 CMS. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the presence of multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Specifically, three instances are identified:
  * XSS via the `key` parameter in `index.php`
  * XSS via the `desc` parameter in `index.php`
  * XSS via the `name` parameter in `page.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows attackers to conduct XSS attacks. This enables them to:
* Display malicious content to website visitors.
* Potentially steal cookies or other session information.
* Perform other malicious actions within the user's browser context.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests:
* By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters (`key`, `desc`, and `name`) of specific PHP pages (`index.php` and `page.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server hosting the Fa Name CMS. No authentication is needed to perform these attacks. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the target.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The report mentions that for the first two vulnerabilities, `magic_quotes_gpc` needs to be set to Off, and for the third, `register_globals` needs to be set to On. These server-side PHP settings need to be in certain states for the exploits to work.
*   The provided examples show how the malicious javascript code is embedded into the request and how it gets executed in the reply.
* The severity of this vulnerability is rated as medium with a CVSS base score of 4.3.
*   The vendor (FaScript) was notified of the vulnerability.
*   A workaround is provided which involves disabling `register_globals` or enabling `magic_quotes_gpc` in the server's PHP configuration file.
