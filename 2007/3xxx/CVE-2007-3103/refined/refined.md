Based on the provided documents, here's information related to CVE-2007-3103:

*   **Vulnerability:** Race condition in the init.d script of X Font Server (xfs).
*   **Root Cause:** The xfs init script does not correctly handle a race condition when setting permissions of a temporary file (`/tmp/.font-unix`). Specifically, the script removes the directory `/tmp/.font-unix`, recreates it, and then sets permissions. An attacker can exploit a time window between the `rm -rf` and `chmod` commands.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local.
*   **Impact:** A local attacker can potentially change the permissions of arbitrary files to be world-writable by performing a symlink attack. This could lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Software:**
    *   x11-apps/xfs versions prior to 1.0.5
    *   xorg-x11-xfs <= 1.0.2-3.1
    *   Debian etch xfs version < 1.0.1-6
*   **Red Hat:** The vulnerability exists in the init.d xfs script.
*   **Gentoo:** Affects x11-apps/xfs < 1.0.5
*   **Mitigation:** Update to x11-apps/xfs-1.0.5 or later.

The exploit requires the xfs service to be restarted, either through a system reboot or manual intervention by an administrator.

Here's the vulnerable code snippet from `/etc/init.d/xfs`:

```
rm -rf /tmp/.font-unix
mkdir /tmp/.font-unix
chmod 1777 /tmp/.font-unix
```

An attacker could potentially slip in after the `rm -rf` but before the `chmod` while the service is being restarted, creating a symlink to a sensitive file, which would then have its permissions modified by the `chmod` command.
