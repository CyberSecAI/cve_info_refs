```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability lies in the way the MyCMS application handles score submissions and includes files. Specifically, the snakep.php and tetrisp.php files allow users to set scores, and the games.php file includes files based on user-provided input via the 'scoreid' parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into a text file and then include that file via the 'scoreid' parameter, resulting in remote command execution.

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Unrestricted file inclusion: The games.php file includes files using user-controlled input ($_GET['scoreid']), leading to a file inclusion vulnerability.
    - Insecure score handling: The snakep.php and tetrisp.php files allow users to write to score files with user-controlled data, enabling the injection of malicious PHP code into these files.
    - Insufficient input validation: There is no proper validation or sanitization of user-provided input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary code into text files and inclusion.

- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can achieve remote command execution on the server by injecting malicious PHP code into a score file and then including that file via the vulnerable games.php script.

- Attack vectors:
    - The attacker first submits a POST request to snakep.php with PHP code in the 'score' parameter, which is then saved to a text file (snake_score.txt).
    - The attacker sends a POST request to games.php using the crafted request,  where 'name' and 'type' parameters are used to create and write a shell (piggy_marty.php), using a file inclusion vulnerability.
    - Finally the attacker calls piggy_marty.php via GET request passing the 'cmd' parameter to execute arbitrary commands.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST and GET requests to the vulnerable MyCMS application.
    - The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable files (snakep.php, games.php).
    - The attacker needs to be able to set the "login" cookie.
