How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Lighttpd: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **200708-11**

Several vulnerabilities were reported in Lighttpd, most of them allowing a
Denial of Service and potentially the remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-servers/lighttpd** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.16** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.16** |

### Background

Lighttpd is a lightweight HTTP web server.

### Description

Stefan Esser discovered errors with evidence of memory corruption in
the code parsing the headers. Several independent researchers also
reported errors involving the handling of HTTP headers, the mod\_auth
and mod\_scgi modules, and the limitation of active connections.

### Impact

A remote attacker can trigger any of these vulnerabilities by sending
malicious data to the server, which may lead to a crash or memory
exhaustion, and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.
Additionally, access-deny settings can be evaded by appending a final /
to a URL.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Lighttpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## [1.4.16 - Let's ship it](/2007/7/24/1-4-16-let-s-ship-it/)

### July 24, 2007

We all could use some refreshment in this hot summer. So how about a fresh and
shiny new lighttpd release? Sadly the main reasons are again a few security
fixes. (Bad developers, bad!) But we broke it, we fix it. On the other hand we
squeezed in a new cool feature aswell. The
[E-Tag](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.19)
generation is now configurable. So if your files are on a NFS cluster you can
now e.g. disable the inode number usage for the E-Tag.

## Teh bugz!!!

header parsing bug
[Lighttpd SA 2007:03](https://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd_sa2007_03.txt)

(patch: [lighttpd-1.4.x\_duplicated\_headers\_with\_folding\_crash.patch](https://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd-1.4.x_duplicated_headers_with_folding_crash.patch))
various mod\_auth bugs
[Lighttpd SA 2007:04](https://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd_sa2007_04.txt)

[Lighttpd SA 2007:05](https://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd_sa2007_05.txt)

[Lighttpd SA 2007:06](https://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd_sa2007_06.txt)

[Lighttpd SA 2007:07](https://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd_sa2007_07.txt)

(patch: [lighttpd-1.4.x\_mod\_auth\_sec.patch](https://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd-1.4.x_mod_auth_sec.patch))
mod\_access bug
[Lighttpd SA 2007:08](https://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd_sa2007_08.txt)

(patch: [lighttpd-1.4.x\_mod\_access\_bypass.patch](https://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd-1.4.x_mod_access_bypass.patch))
mod\_fastcgi local DOS bug
[Lighttpd SA 2007:09](https://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd_sa2007_09.txt)
(patch: [lighttpd-1.4.x\_mod\_fastcgi\_local\_dos.patch](https://download.lighttpd.net/lighttpd/security/lighttpd-1.4.x_mod_fastcgi_local_dos.patch))

The reader might wonder now why we delayed the release that long. We actually
tried to get CVE numbers for all the bugs, to avoid confusion later. But so
far we did not succeed in receiving them. As the bugs got publically announced
now, we are forced to release.

## SUSE Security

# A Process That Never Ends

### SUSE is committed to delivering best effort security to its customers and to the Open Source community. We believe that trust in Open Source Software security in general, and the user's privacy in particular, are both indispensable and indefeasible.

We treat software security as a process that never ends. This means we:

* Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates
* Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products
* Continuously contribute to the rapidly growing maturity of Open Source Software
* Respect the Open Source Software security principles of openness, transparency and traceability

Software security is a complex challenge. Software can provide many of its own security features, such as authentication methods, encryption, intrusion prevention and detection, and backup.

At the same time, it can also contain errors (both deliberate and accidental) that can affect the system's security, including design flaws, programming errors, and backdoors.

The SUSE Security Team addresses all of these aspects of software security, on an ongoing basis. Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This persistent focus is what has given Open Source Software, Linux and SUSE such an excellent reputation for security.

### appending / to URL breaks access-deny setting

Added by Anonymous [over 17 years](/projects/lighttpd/activity?from=2007-06-10 "2007-06-10 06:34") ago.
Updated [over 17 years](/projects/lighttpd/activity?from=2007-06-15 "2007-06-15 14:48") ago.

**Description**

If a / is appended to a URL, lighttpd incorrectly serves the original URL.

i.e. a request for

<http://www.ahost.com/graphics/image.jpg/>

will result in lighty serving the file at

<http://www.ahost.com/graphics/image.jpg>

This breaks access-deny settings! For instance, if I have configured lighty to deny hot-linked .jpg's like this:

$HTTP[referer](/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Referer) !~ "^($|http://www.ahost.com)" {
 url.access-deny = ( ".jpg" )
}

Then the hot-linked request for "http://www.ahost.com/graphics/image.jpg" will be denied...

But the hot-linked request for "http://www.ahost.com/graphics/image.jpg/" will be served and the access-deny setting will not be obeyed. This means that any hot-linker can get around my access-deny settings by appending the "/" to the file he wants to hot-link.

The solution is for lighty to not serve up the original file when a request for that file with an appened "/" is made.

* **Status** changed from *New* to *Fixed*
* **Resolution** set to *fixed*

One solution is to use static-file.exclude-extentions = ( ".jpg" ) instead or wait for r1871 to appear.
