Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3949:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a bug within the `mod_access` module of lighttpd. Specifically, the module does not correctly handle requests for URLs that include trailing slash characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Access Control Bypass:** The core issue is that when a trailing slash is appended to a URL, lighttpd bypasses the configured access restrictions that are set via `url.access-deny`. This allows unauthorized access to resources that should otherwise be restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** By adding a trailing slash to a restricted URL, an attacker can bypass the defined access control rules. This can lead to sensitive data being leaked or unauthorized actions being performed.
- **Circumvention of Hotlink Protection:** If `url.access-deny` is used to prevent hotlinking of images or other resources, the trailing slash bypass allows attackers to directly link to these resources from external sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by sending HTTP requests to the lighttpd server with a trailing slash character at the end of a URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable lighttpd server. No prior authentication or specific system access is required.
- The attacker would also need to know the restricted URLs.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- **Debian Security Advisory:** The Debian Security Advisory DSA-1362 explicitly mentions that a bug in `mod_access` potentially allows remote users to bypass access restrictions via trailing slash characters (CVE-2007-3949).
- **Gentoo Security Advisory:** The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 200708-11 states that access-deny settings can be evaded by appending a final / to a URL.
- **lighttpd changelog:** The lighttpd changelog also lists "mod\_access bug" as one of the fixed vulnerabilities in version 1.4.16. The corresponding patch `lighttpd-1.4.x_mod_access_bypass.patch` is also mentioned.
- **lighttpd bug report:** Bug #1230 on the lighttpd bug tracker directly describes the issue. It states that appending "/" to a URL breaks access-deny setting and that lighttpd incorrectly serves the original URL in such cases, which breaks hotlink protection.
- **Fix:** One of the suggested fixes is to use `static-file.exclude-extentions = ( ".jpg" )` instead. The vulnerability is resolved in `r1871`
