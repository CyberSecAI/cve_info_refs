    "root_cause": "Wireshark doesn't properly handle chunked encoding in HTTP responses.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of chunked encoding in HTTP responses"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets on a network being monitored with Wireshark, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Wireshark (which might be the root user), or a Denial of Service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted packets on a network being monitored by Wireshark.",
      "Convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file."

    "additional_info": "This vulnerability is triggered when Wireshark dissects an HTTP chunked response. This could lead to a crash, excessive loop, or memory exhaustion."
