        "CVE": "CVE-2007-3160",
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability is a result of a remote file inclusion (RFI) vulnerability in the header.php file of the PHP Real Estate Classifieds Premium Plus application.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The application's header.php file includes external files without proper sanitization or validation of the 'loc' parameter.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can include a malicious file, which could contain arbitrary PHP code, leading to remote code execution on the server.",
        "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a URL containing the path to the vulnerable header.php file and appends a 'loc' parameter pointing to a malicious file they control.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and host their malicious file on a server accessible to the target application."
