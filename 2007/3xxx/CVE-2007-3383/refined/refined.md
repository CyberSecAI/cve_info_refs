  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary script within the security context of the web site running Apache Tomcat.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting malicious script into the 'From' field of the SendMailServlet.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable SendMailServlet with the malicious payload within the 'From' parameter. No specific position is required, making this attack possible from a remote position.",
    "Affected versions": "4.0.0 to 4.0.6 and 4.1.0 to 4.1.36"
