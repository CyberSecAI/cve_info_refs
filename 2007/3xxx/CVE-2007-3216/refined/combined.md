##### Total Defense Security Tip of the Day

#### 01.24.25

#### [Keep your Mac files safe: back up to iCloud](https://www.totaldefense.com/security-blog/keep-your-mac-files-safe-back-up-to-icloud/)

Losing important files from your Mac can be a major headache. That's why backing up your data regularly is crucial. iCloud Drive makes it incredibly easy to keep your files safe and accessible across all your Apple devices.

**How to Back Up Your Mac to iCloud:**

2. **Sign in to iCloud:** Make sure you're signed in to iCloud on your Mac using your Apple ID.

6. **Enable iCloud Drive:** Head to **System Settings** (or **System Preferences** on older macOS versions) and click on your **Apple ID**.

10. **Activate Desktop and Documents Folders:** Select **iCloud Drive** and then click **Options**.

14. **Check the Boxes:** Check the boxes next to "Desktop Folders" and "Documents Folders." This tells iCloud to sync these folders to your iCloud account.

From now on, any files you save to your Mac's Desktop or Documents folders will automatically be backed up to iCloud.

**Benefits of Using iCloud Drive:**

* **Access Your Files Anywhere:** Access your files from any [Apple device](https://www.totaldefense.com/security-blog/how-to-step-up-your-apple-id-security/ "How to step up your Apple ID security"), including iPhones, iPads, and other Macs.

* **Automatic Backups:** Your files are backed up automatically and continuously, ensuring your data is always up-to-date.

* **Easy File Sharing:** Easily share files with other iCloud users.

**Remember:**

* **Check Your Storage:** Monitor your iCloud storage usage to ensure you have enough space for all your backups.

* **Enable Two-Factor Authentication:** Protect your iCloud account with two-factor authentication for enhanced security.

By utilizing iCloud Drive, you can protect your valuable data and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing your [Mac files are safe](https://www.totaldefense.com/security-blog/do-i-need-antivirus-for-mac/ "Do I need antivirus for Mac?") and accessible.

##### Total Defense Security Tip of the Day

#### 01.24.25

#### [Keep your Mac files safe: back up to iCloud](https://www.totaldefense.com/security-blog/keep-your-mac-files-safe-back-up-to-icloud/)

Losing important files from your Mac can be a major headache. That's why backing up your data regularly is crucial. iCloud Drive makes it incredibly easy to keep your files safe and accessible across all your Apple devices.

**How to Back Up Your Mac to iCloud:**

2. **Sign in to iCloud:** Make sure you're signed in to iCloud on your Mac using your Apple ID.

6. **Enable iCloud Drive:** Head to **System Settings** (or **System Preferences** on older macOS versions) and click on your **Apple ID**.

10. **Activate Desktop and Documents Folders:** Select **iCloud Drive** and then click **Options**.

14. **Check the Boxes:** Check the boxes next to "Desktop Folders" and "Documents Folders." This tells iCloud to sync these folders to your iCloud account.

From now on, any files you save to your Mac's Desktop or Documents folders will automatically be backed up to iCloud.

**Benefits of Using iCloud Drive:**

* **Access Your Files Anywhere:** Access your files from any [Apple device](https://www.totaldefense.com/security-blog/how-to-step-up-your-apple-id-security/ "How to step up your Apple ID security"), including iPhones, iPads, and other Macs.

* **Automatic Backups:** Your files are backed up automatically and continuously, ensuring your data is always up-to-date.

* **Easy File Sharing:** Easily share files with other iCloud users.

**Remember:**

* **Check Your Storage:** Monitor your iCloud storage usage to ensure you have enough space for all your backups.

* **Enable Two-Factor Authentication:** Protect your iCloud account with two-factor authentication for enhanced security.

By utilizing iCloud Drive, you can protect your valuable data and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing your [Mac files are safe](https://www.totaldefense.com/security-blog/do-i-need-antivirus-for-mac/ "Do I need antivirus for Mac?") and accessible.

To display a VB100 logo, a product must:

* Prove it can detect 100% of malware samples listed as ‘In the Wild’ by the WildList Organization
* Generate no false positives when scanning an extensive test set of clean samples.
* All this must be done with default, out-of-the-box settings in the VB lab environment.
