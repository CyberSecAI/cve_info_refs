Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3431:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Remote File Inclusion (RFI) issue present in the `cal.func.php` file of the Dagger web engine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The `cal.func.php` file includes another file based on a user-controlled parameter:  `include($dir_edge_lang.'cal_lang.inc.php');` This allows an attacker to specify a remote file to be included, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- The parameter `dir_edge_lang` is not properly sanitized, allowing for the inclusion of external files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote server on the vulnerable system. This can lead to a complete compromise of the web server, including data theft, modification, or the installation of malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the `cal.func.php` file.
- An attacker can inject malicious code by manipulating the `dir_edge_lang` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server where the vulnerable Dagger web engine is running.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication or access to the server.
- The attacker needs a publicly available file (hosted on a server controlled by attacker) containing the malicious code to be included.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version `Dagger_r28jun2007`.
- This vulnerability is also referenced by Milw0rm exploit ID 4097, SecurityFocus Bugtraq ID 24605 and Secunia Advisory SA25790.
- The vendor acknowledged and fixed the vulnerability.
