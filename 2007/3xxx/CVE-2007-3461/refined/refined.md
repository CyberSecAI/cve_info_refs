      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, specifically usernames and their corresponding modified MD5 password hashes.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET requests with crafted parameters"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `property.php` file.",
