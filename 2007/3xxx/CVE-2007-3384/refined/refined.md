Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2007-3384:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Tomcat's failure to filter user-supplied data when generating error messages. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code within the error messages displayed to users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By injecting malicious scripts into user-provided data, attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can lead to the execution of malicious JavaScript code within a victim's browser. This can have several impacts:
    - **Session hijacking:** Attackers could steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate legitimate users.
    - **Data theft:** Sensitive data could be exfiltrated.
    - **Malware distribution:** The attacker could redirect the user to malicious websites or install malware.
    - **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the web page.

**Attack vectors:**

- **User-supplied data:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through user-provided input that is later included in error messages without proper filtering. This could be via URL parameters, form fields or any other mechanism that allows a user to provide input to the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to inject data:** An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the Tomcat application. This could be directly via web requests, or indirectly via an intermediate system.
- **No authentication needed:** The vulnerability exists in the processing of user input, which is typically not gated by authentication. Thus no prior authentication is required to launch the attack.
- **Understanding of error messages:** The attacker needs to craft a payload that will cause an error message to be generated, and ensure the payload is included in that error message.

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache Tomcat 3.3 - 3.3.2

**Additional Notes:**

- A source code patch was made available in the archives.
- Tomcat 3 is no longer supported and users are advised to upgrade to a more recent version.
